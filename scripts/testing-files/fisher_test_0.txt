Mm
Then any Canadian resident has rights to medical services  ,   just to be there and they don't have any economical consequences
No  ,   bu  the difference is that they started right
Yes  ,   Exactly
It's like Argentina  ,   my parents have all the medical bills paid
Oh
All medical coverage is paid  ,   they pay a little amount  ,   not so much
Yes  ,   this is one thing we should make  ,   at least paying something
yes
having some type of social security  ,   but even that is really
yes  ,   its really expensive
all over the world  ,   All over the world
And there is more competition there in drugs  .   That's weird
Yes  ,   there was a drug my son was taking there  ,   and well  ,   when we moved here we couldn't find it
Oh
So  ,   we went to Argentina last year  ,   I went to the drugstore and something you pay more than 50 dollars here
i bought it there for 12 dollars
yes  ,   yes
12 dollars  ,   same company and everything
yes  .  
Same  .   yes  .  
with similar ingredients
Mm
That's true  .   It really is true  .  
I mean I  ,   according to things like this
But
yes  .  
Mm  ,   mm  .   oh yes  .  
Eh  ,   because they help the children  .  
Now I don't know if they specialize in a specific disease  .   Or if they cover everything because perhaps
You can communicate with them and say to them  ,   he hears we have this boy and this is his condition and this is our situation  .  
And perhaps they can help in some way  .   Because the Shriners are dedicated to helping  ,   to paying for the medical care of children  .   That they can't pay  .  
of the parents who can't pay  .  
Ah  .   I noticed that  .   Yes I only knew and thought it was for me  .   And I much smaller without you tiring and for more style
And also if you call to Catholic Charities
Uh  .   Uh uh  .   That yes  .  
there are many samples  .   And  ,   but knowing a bit more about the advances is that I can give the medicine that we think that a deeper diagnosis could improve the life of my son with
Sure  .  
Mm  .   And of course he's growing up and then maybe that medicine doesn't work anymore  ,   they have to give him another one  .  
Mm  .  
Yes  ,   yes  ,   we was very ill
what a thing  .  
yes  ,   yes  ,   well so you know  ,   it's a matter of experimenting  .  
And you  ,   you must live with your hearts in your mouth  .  
and that causes a lot of stress  .  
Much stress
the life even if you don't say it your always looking after him  ,   all the time  .  
Mmm  .    .  
Yes it is a heavy load  ,   it's a really heavy load for him  .  
17
Oh  ,   it's just a teenager
Yes  .    .  Hey  ,   getting back at subject  ,   I think there must be a a good ones her
Mm
And we do not have
Oh  ,   I see
And they take note of whatever they give us  ,   and after that they charge
a reasonable account  .   Something we can afford  ,   sometimes they don't even charge at all
yeah
And a few years ago I thought I had it  ,   but in the end I went and I had kind of self diagnosed  ,   and in the end I found here the teaching hospital of the University of North Carolina
Yeah
and they didn't charge me anything and they performed all the tests on me
yes
So everything is very well  ,   to which orientation are we going  ,   right  ,   in fact  ,   the place I went to precisely is called University System  ,   healthcare system or something like that but
Ah  ,   yes  ,   then it's that with the
Then it's precisely there where they bounced me
I told him
Ah  ,   but what a thing
Mm  .  
But  ,   not that  ,   we need the social security of your employer  .   And then that's when they didn't want to anymore
They didn't want to give you that information  .  
Maybe now you can
Uh uh  .  
hi  ,   good eh  ,   matt here
i am in san antonio Matt i think we have spoken before you are in Philadelphia
yes and you are
oh look its a placer talk with you again
the theme is the technical devices  ,   i mean the technology  ,   the devices that you use more and you depend of them how do you consider these dependency
yes because it is a machine you know
exactly so  ,   yes if the cars seems to be so important  no then i thought better is a computer bu no
yes the most obvious its the computer  ,   but its not the only one
OK exactly but sometimes seems like a personal element depending of the case  ,   so  it can be a car no because the computer is a tool every time more
oh
yes that's why the same things you buy a car and always you are using it and always you have to mantained  ,   always its a part of your life
yes yes  ,   exactly  ,   besides as I'm here in Texas
ah
I feel that the automobile culture here is like a reminiscence of the culture of the horses too
yes
yes
for some years yes  ,   because if they say no the devices that have to do with communication are the most important in our age  ,   like computers

<very bad phrase>
yes  ,   because  ,   here in Texas yes  ,   because up here in Texas
but
yes
then
i see
the most most important
yes but  ,     ,   the questions on the subject were which
well  ,   for me it would be more my computer and my cellular telephone
uh huh  ,   exactly
uh huh
uh huh
before  ,   I didn't have a cellphone until I was like twenty years old  ,   but now that to  ,   that I live in Philadelphia in the city and that I'm not always at home for 
yes  ,   yes
okay always always I am  ,   always I have my cellphone
you have your cellphone
I think that it's very it's like surprising that almost everybody has a cellphone  ,   here in the United States
yes
yes
The computer was the most important  .  
But now  ,  
But now  ,   With the type of work that Im realizing the auto is the most important  .   the computer  ,   because the auto is what let you  ,   re e el Type of work that Im doing is more  .  
But of course is by the type of good work  .  
Way more space
yes  ,  yes
For in the city having a auto it can be convenient as well  .  
yes  ,  yes  ,   that yes  .  
Because always you have to try to park and to have to pay a lot to park  ,   and the gas station is not close by and  ,   I do not know it  .  
It is better to have an auto hm I think  .  
Yes hm  ,   yes  .   no maybe here yes  ,   for the distance that needs to go in the job  ,   the auto is fundamental  .  
aha  ,   clear  .  
aha  .  
And that  ,   and hm  ,   and the other question is if you consider that those hm  ,   these technologies will convert more into a problem than  ,   than in  .    .    .    .  
aha
let's say  ,   those problems here  ,   but but in the end  ,   I don't know  ,   I don't know what you think  ,   above  ,   above everything i would say that  ,   well in regard to the care  ,   issues with cars and all of that well like it is not seen as a large problem unless it is
we could consider as a problem the interests created around the  ,   the auto industry and like sometimes they seem to affect the same technology development of the
yes
s o we look how seventy five years in the past there were no cars  ,   but these days almost everybody has
yes yes  ,    ,   yes but  ,   yes
and the same thing with the computers they have  ,   they have computers that are not going to let come out to the market until  ,   like ten years  ,   because
since
because they have th  the things very advances and the things have not ___ have not _____
yes
one hundred kilometers with only one liter of gas
aha
yes
that  ,   at lot of them say that they are not affordable  ,   that it's really a matter of image that companies do  ,   and when it comes to see the  ,   the return tables
of the hybrid cars  ,   well  ,   I though they would be a lot more efficient  ,   but I think what they've achieved is a minimal efficiency
yes
yes  ,   that was a very important breakthrough
you don't think it's an important breakthrough
no  ,   I don't think it's so important  ,   taking into account that the efficiency they show is not radically different from the other cars'  ,   I mea
ah
according to the tables  ,   an economical car will give you maybe thirty six miles per gallon
yeah
and a Hybrid can give you fifty
no  ,   ah  ,   yes  ,   there are cars now like  ,   like the Ford cars
uhm  ,   well
aha
by  ,   small cars  ,   new that are not in the Northamerican market  ,   that are in the European or Latinamerican market where they have to be much more efficient  .  
oh  ,   yes
no  it is much more expensive to have a car which is because of the initial cost and why it will be saved a lot in in gas  ,   it ends up
and  ,   why is it that
European
yes  ,   it is  ,   yes
yes I  ,   precisely  ,   years ago when there was the problem with petroleum  ,   in the eighties or something like that  ,   I recall
ah  ,   aha
I thought that it there was going to be a change in the culture  ,   because they started to  ,   to develop smaller cares here in the United States  .  
yes  ,   but
I'm Ana Maria
Ah Faviola  ,   hi
Hello Faviola
Great  ,   it's sunny but cold  .  
Sunny and cold  ,   ah  .  
Cold
yes
I've talked about that subject before too  .  
Yea I've talked about it and I've talked about the uh  ,   one I remember specifically talking about was about violence  .  
mhm
that it  ,   that they didn't like the idea of going to see movies  .   And I told them  ,   that the world that the world is  ,   it has violence
mhm
It's always had it  ,   and I've had the chance to teach children about peace and love with the TV or  ,   or in the world and later when they go out into the real world at school  .  
They find that  ,   that kids hit each other  ,   that they don't know how to defend themselves  .   Especially when you have only children  .  
uh huh
so uh  ,   I think that it's OK that they rate the movies how they do  ,   I think it's the responsibility of adults  ,   even where their kids can watch TV  .  
I agree  ,   the respon  the most important responsibility of parents  .  
They are doing their job them of the movies and
They are earning their money  ,   what is your job  .  
it's his business  ,   you
doing his business  ,   yes
yes today the one that wants  ,   the one that wants to see  ,   he doesn't want to see him anymore it is not their responsibility  ,   they see
of  ,   yes
that they sell
yes
It is what they do  ,   it is not their fault  ,   it is the fault of those that buy it
yes  ,   of who likes the product  ,   because of that
yes
with you it is the maximum responsibility  ,   if it is violence  ,   sex  ,   whatever it is protect a child  .   The biggest responsibility is of the parents  ,   even with classification
Because there is a classification of a movie for example  PG thirteen
yes
And you have a small child of that age and you let him watch that movie it is your responsibility
yes
Exactly
Then because I the the the association  ,   o  ,   o  ,   o  ,   whatever it is they one who puts the classifications already has it then
I believe yes  ,   we believe more or less the same thing in that Faviola because in the end the responsibility of raising  ,   taking are of and wanting them to see or not see
Your sons  ,   or your family  .    eh  ,   You as a mother or your husband as a mother  .  
mm I believe also that I agree completely and the other  ,   normally the children have access to television when the parents are out  .  
Exactly
the kids are alone
mhm
And there is not father to teach them or tell them  ,   you should not watch this  ,   you should watch
Or if they go to a sleepover  ,   you don't know either
Sure  ,   no because you don't have any idea
If they go to a sleepover and the watch a movie  ,   they watch a movie and they don't have any control at that house  ,   or whatever
You don't know either
Exactly
I believe it is important to give to your children one  ,   that they respect those  ,   signs if yone give them good principles at home  .    One as a famly  ,   then teach them  ,   things
Sure
That really I don't like or why I don't like  .    You watch  ,   or you are nor ready  ,   or the time will come
What  ,   because as they say  ,   they cannot have them in a crystal box
No  ,   and also
go  ,   exposed
yes  ,   also when the children reach certain age  .    Mi son was fifteen  ,   sixteen  ,   seventeen years old and he tells me  ,   don't worry  ,   because you did better than you could do
mhm
ah  ,   it is twenty five percent genes and education  ,   the rest is the decision  ,   the decision of my life
Look  ,   with that that
Of course  ,   then I learned  .   Oh wait  ,   no eh  ,   oh  ,   I was and
mm
My cellphone was ringing  .   Okay Okay let me answer  .  
okay
eh  ,   don't hang up on me because we have to talk for twelve minutes  .  
yes
The I only went to turn it off  .  
Okay ah
And about people I think about movies I love to Watch horror movies
OK
But there are times when the when  ,   when I get scared I'm an adult  .  
You  ,   you scare yourself  ,  
I get scared and I go find out horror movies  .  
okay okay But your responsibility is to watch it  ,   and you yourself scare yourself  .  
yes That's why That's why I respect what my son told me that time  ,   Fifty percent is responsibility  ,  
Yes
of  ,   of the individual  ,   of the person  ,   eh  ,   you already did the best you could  ,   but then comes the time for the young people of the past to be eighteen at the  .  
that some are much more mature than normal
yes
And they starts seeing R rated movies
mmm
at around fourteen and fifteen years old and the PG thirteen the kids that are eleven and twelve years old are already seeing them  .  
already thirteen already
 PG thirteen  ,   PG fourteen and then I say  ,   that Jenny doesn't like it because she gets scared  .  
Yes
But I am in accordance  ,   that the major part is  ,   the criteria that you form and that way in the end  .   take care of them and not let them watch television when they are by themselves  .  
But imagine the same we can't control them  .  
You have to have a formulated criteria to go and see some movies  .  
yes and that's why I'm telling you that you don't get nothing out in telling them  ,   you can't see that  ,   no  .   Because there will come a time in which they go to the house like I say to a friends house  .  
They show them documentals
But what I fear the most is when it goes to friend's houses  .   And the have the television right there  ,   that's used a lot  ,   or the computer  ,   or whatever
Maybe they are watching something non adequate  .   That's why I say  ,   I mean  ,   if my son or daughter or whoever
Keep going like the superman kid that went up to the window and kill himself
my  ,   of course  ,   because you know they are not ready for that
It wanted to fly  .   No  ,   I don't want to aks you a question
aha
eh  ,   did you read the rules for this game  ,   the telephone game
yes  ,   OK
yes  ,   yes  ,   yes I'm getting ready  ,   buying the presnets for the family  .   But now I have  ,   I have another things in my mind
of course about your birthday no
yes but  ,   I'm getting ready  ,   buying presents for all the famliy  ,   at least for the nieces  .   I have them ready  ,   we've bought you the presents  ,   then there is only the adults left
Buy things for the adults  ,   an antencion  ,   although I'll make most of the presents
That's what I was going to tell you
I'm going to cook  ,   yes  ,   ah
cooking and sewing  .   Sewing that thing that you did  ,   you gave that to me  .  
yes  ,   the  ,   the  ,   yes also  ,   but I donÂ´t have time yet to wait until middle of  ,   until the middle week of December to do it  .  
That is beautiful  .  
Two days before Miranda  .  
ItÂ´s AndreitaÂ´s birthday  ,   too  .   Or  ,   three
Oh  ,   now I remember it was about three days  .  
For him I will  a screen like those that you draw and then you erase  .  
Oh itÂ´s nice
Because she likes  ,   she already knew them and she likes them  ,   she makes little dashes and then she erases them and  ,   IÂ´m not going to give them to her yet because they are very small and she puts them in the mouth  .  
But the screen and the pencil yes  ,   I will  .  
what a feeling  .  
And do you know who else's birthday  .  
Okay who
The same date
Until I remember when I was there
My father in law  ,   that
Your father in law  ,   yes
the  ,   the  ,   Juan Luis Sandra's younger son  .  
Oh yes Okay
Also the twenty nine  .   I also remember  ,   that more or less in the same date  ,   I remember that everybody were there in the same date
I don't remember that he was in at least I did not know  .  
I have not gone to any birthday in Sandra's house  .   I was to one pure  ,   I don't remember  ,   really  .  
yes  ,   for her nephew who came later
Of course he came  ,   yes  ,   he told me that he received it afterwards from her  .   But his name no  ,  
No but Sandra won't throw a party this year for her birthday
no no  ,   okay
No  ,   she said that family only  ,   because they will buy something better for the kid  ,   so
yes  ,   it's true
She makes really big parties  ,   so
it gets away from her hands  ,   yes
She spends too much in that  ,   and that's why they cannot buy the kid whats he  ,  
What he really wants  ,   yes exactly
they have to decide between the two things  ,   so this year they decided that only the family
So he could get a more special present
Of course  ,   for a better gift
The smaller of all
Oh yeah  .  
And he always says that he doesn  .  t want any clothes
Oh poor boy  .  
I am in the State of Washington  ,  Seattle
wow  ,   I am in Los Angeles  .  
Ah yes  ,  
yes it is just incredible
yes
Right now I was making a call and suddenly and I did not think today is Sunday I was half sleep more then awake and I Oh my God  .  
Yes this is I believe my twenty third call  .  
wow it is almost ready  ,   me well just half almost to the tenth  .  
yes and this is the second time I do this service with them  .  
yes
yes I are
rather yeah tell me
not too "conventional"
aha
Yes because there are lots of movies so  ,   I have noticed
yes
yes I like a  ,   around here where I live there uste to be one of those ah like Hollywood Video or Blockbuster but it was like
smaller
OK
and they had movies like the ones they're talking about  ,   documentaries and stuff  ,   but they had to close because since the big stores are around  ,   people won't go to these places
Sure
but those are the best ones  ,   I can find movies I like  ,   yes  ,   my husband is from America  ,   but he likes international movies too  ,   movies that have more
more important things to say
Exactly  ,   exactly
From time to time  ,   since I have young children  ,   sometimes they want to see some movies and we take them  ,   but usually no  ,   we have  .   Before  ,   we used to go to the movies two or three times a month
No  ,   no  ,   no  .   And then we started getting information about other kind of movies  ,   and well  ,   we changed completely to that kind of movie  .   Actually   ,  right now we are in
a different content  ,   that's worth watching  ,   but lately I feel they're making movies just for the sake of making them
yeah  ,   exactly
it's like  ,   well  ,   he have to make 10 movies  .   We'll make then movies  ,   it doesn't matter how  ,   or when  ,   just
with the means of communication we are like this  ,  yes yes  .  
I believe aja  .  
because every time you see something or they put on something really stupid
exactly
Or the do or they exagerate a lot
Exactly  .  
when we went out did you know he was American  .  
of course
and suddenly  ,   we got home and we turned the TV on  ,   and there were a bunch of stuff going on at Pananama  ,   and i looked at him
Exactly  .  
and the next day it was the same  ,   and i say  ,   Â¡oh what an ex agent  .    ,   I think they where showing the things that happened last week and exaggerating like that  ,   Â¿what
the news  ,   none of that  .   that's what i tell my kids  ,   don't believe everything the TV says  .  
Right
That's just when Noriega's problem and everything else we were watching the whole documentary  ,   and i was like  ,   it's cold  ,   because i would never had imagined that it was so sad and so
so ugly what happened
That was the documentary where they spoke about that men that got his head cut off
and  ,   oh yeah
It isn't  ,   it isn't remembered
You know  ,   i can't remember exactly  ,   i don't remember but  .    .    .   what i can remember is that night  ,   when they bombed and a lot of people died  ,   uh  ,   even so  ,   a few days ago they showed a
aha  ,   but in that place you say  ,   almost happens the same in Venezuela with the current President  .   There are happening things that you know are happening to us  .  
Univision  .   That donÂ´t be so shameless  ,   that donÂ´t put those things there  ,   that was not the reality  ,   the first thing people tell you  ,   eh  .   And that President
yes that
and and ah well  ,   I donÂ´t know if you have heard him
no  ,   no because as I tell you  ,   I donÂ´t get to much in that news stuff  ,   sometimes
of course  ,   of course  ,   look there is a page on the internet where you can watch television from all the countries including Panama  ,   of course it is called
TV four all  ,   like TV four all
TV
four all
Yes  ,   Theater
Four is a number four
aha
  TV number four all
TV or Tv for all
exactly  ,   exactly there you go
with
it is dot com yes
OK
there you see the programming of all the channels all the chanels of the world and then of ocurse Panama and Venezuela  .    And then now I  ,   now I see the Venezuelan television  .  
but I like to watch to see what horrific things they are saying  .  
the whole world  ,   a bit like for comparing  ,   what is going on and even we are doing it with radio  ,   we're listening to community radio  ,   that you feel like you ar 
are saying truly the truth or at least the other side of the coin  ,   let's not say it's the truth a hundred per cent because sometimes it's not
I mean  ,   it's like I don't know  ,   it's not that you can say that that everything the others say is not but
aha
Good heavens  .   truly they manipulate it too much  .  
It's a documentary about those who work in Fox News
mhm
and well the practically force them to say what it's not and then they decided to resign from the channel and besides resigning they all got together and the started to protest at a level
well  ,   at the level of  ,   of  ,   eh  ,   locally to tell the world what was going on inside Fox News  .   It's very interesting  ,   it's called something like
Washington DC
yes  ,   Washington State
Oh  ,   and the other one
I'm talking from Idaho  ,   i don't know if you know it
Yes  ,   of course
Yes  ,   well  ,   personally I don't believe that much about the movies ratings  .   For my point of view  ,   the ratings don't go the way i suppose they would be
they don't know how to rate them  .   For example  ,   sometimes they said that it is a PG movie  ,   but when you watch it  ,   and it really
has rude things  ,   and pornography  ,   and sometimes something stronger like a PG 13 is more quiet
and doesn't have that many nude scenes or bad language  .   Personally  ,   I don't care about those ratings  ,   sometimes it just
Yes  ,   i really don't know that much about movies  ,   because
Aha
let's say  ,   I don't have children or anything like that  ,   so I barely ever notice
Aha
what  ,   what classification
Aha
But I think that the majority of TV there is  ,   let's say if you watch during the middle of the day that is when many times children are at home
Aha
are things that are not appropriate for most
yes
yes
many things already are like normal that that I think that they should not be
yes  ,   yes it is true because  ,   uhm  ,   and it is true because uhm  ,   oe time  ,   well I don't have cable have  ,   the regular channels  ,   the ones one can watch
Aha
to be well choosing the program I am going to see for that whi  for that time
Hmjm
and sometimes they air movies that  ,   boy  ,   yes a ten or nine year old boy was at home and was watching the  ,   was changing it too at the same time that I and
stop on that channel  ,   there were things like very  ,   like very for adults already
Sure
Then I said  ,   uf  ,   I said I thought about the children  ,   I said  ,   well  ,   I  ,   I am married  ,   I have been married three years and I have a  ,   a boy who is almost two years old  .  
OK
In any case my son is going to grow up and maybe this is going to get worse  .    Then
of course and 
imagine then what kind of cartoons they are going to  well I remember that once I was watching television  .    Look  ,   in Mexico  ,   I am from Mexico City
to the channel that here is sixteen  ,   then there was a cartoon in English  .    Because at night they show some in English  ,   some in Spanish
Well  ,   well the cartoons started to show up naked
ah
and the cartoon was starting to do things the two cartoon figures  .    And it was a cartoon  ,   imagine  ,   and it was ten at night  ,   my mom told me
what a horror
she turned the television off and well she had to explain a bit because well my mom she  ,   it didn't  ,   it surprised her because I had tuned to a cartoon channel a normal channel  .  
Then  ,   OK the truth  ,   not even cartoons are safe  .  
Sometimes cartoons yes
And you cannot either be on top of let's say if the kid changes you cannot jump to see or whatever  ,   you have to trust that  ,   that let's say  ,   at least during the day
yes
programming does not contain nudity or curse words or anything like that  .  
uh  ,   tru   ,   in CablevisiÃ³n and MultivisiÃ³n  ,   that would be what cable here to  uh  ,   there in MÃ©xico  ,   it hasn't all those restrictions  .   But  ,   for example  ,   in normal tv's  ,   with normal channels
Yes  ,   it has like more  ,   more restrictions  .   Uh  ,   not so much now on the other cables  .   and  ,   for example  ,   In  ,   in tv's  ,   for example  ,   normal of ch  children's channel
pornography thing or with more nudity  .  
Right
And then her kid was watching  ,   uh  ,   the a cartoon channel and after that the girl wanted to change the channel and  ,   uh  ,   it was another channel that was also programmed for them  ,   for kids  .  
Aha  ,   but it showed and I went and told her  ,   her mom of hers and she told me ah  ,   there's no problem  ,   it's a channel of
of  ,   of cartoons  ,   of  ,   that they show a lot of programs  .   And  ,   honestly it was it was  ,   it didn't  ,   it didn't leave much to the imagination  .   I was really like the pose of  ,   well it was like an operation room where the woman was having her baby  .  
what they want  .   But honestly for m  if I don't want to explain too much to my children in that moment  ,   well honestly I  ,   like  ,   keep watch more what  ,  
they don't leave anything to the mi  to the imagination  ,   they show it right away  .  
many mo  moms are at home and they have little children three  ,   four years old  ,   five or more or they're at home and they watch  ,   they're watching their soap opera
and they're al  always show scenes where they are the  ,   the couple  ,   they're there having relations  .  
hmm
And in the middle of the day  ,   because the soap operas later are on from six in the morning until nightfall  .  
no  ,   I
So  ,   the programs  ,   are classified  ,   to see a scene of pornography on the television at anytime of the day is normal  .   And for many
parents unfortunately are making it normal
exactly
And I believe that that if the parents spoke to this television station and said that or demand that that were more strict programs to  ,   to privacies of scenes  ,   of this type of scenes
I believe that they would decrease a little  .   But anyways  ,   not now or   ,   until parents if their children see something like that  ,   it's okay  ,   it's no problem  .  
if a movie has some sex scene or has crudeness for the people they buy it or the people see it and they even s they laugh  ,  
or sometimes it even calls their attention because it has a very strong scene  .   So really  ,   these these things sometimes even help more
producers to sell
sometimes  ,   and
If that's the case  ,   no  .   Uh  ,   for me in particular  ,   the type of movies that I like  ,   in truth I really like Disney movies  ,   the
yes  ,   yes   ,   yes
Even though I  ,   I am tired and I love all of this  .   I have some Disney movie around here  .   Sincerely  ,   I do not like the movies
of course  ,   of course
yes he/she does not know how they are going to change
no  ,   no  ,   yes then already  ,   this is the truth  ,   this is bringing the truth far as it already goes  ,   you turn on the television and if you  .    .   you already see a commercial  .  
put there how she is placing the towel
exactly
but if a boy or a girl is seeing it for example  ,   and yoiu say if it is the mom and you can answer  ,   well fine  ,   and if it is the friend boy or girl
and you tell them  ,   and can explain to him/her the bad information  ,   then  .    .    .  
I see Mariza  ,   we talked a few days ago I think  ,   no  .  
Listen the theme for today is about religion  ,   no  .  
Ah  ,   yes really today in this country  .    Eh  ,   In the United States there is a lot  ,   lot of problems regarding religion  ,   it is a mix with politics and lot of right side people that want to have control  .  
Hmm  ,   yeah
Then they exerted a power very  ,   very direct  ,   very  ,   sure  ,   trying to influence people there at the church
Yeah
With the discourse  ,   it came to my attention against the public schools
Aham
Directly against the public schools and praying for God to free us from public school some day
Because yes
Oh  ,   oh  ,   no
And against the theory  ,   about trying to see the theory of evolution  ,   no
Oh  ,   I've heard that  ,   yes
Exactly  ,   yeah  ,   there are a lot of problems  ,   yeah
Well  ,   I'm getting carried  ,   what I say is that  ,   reasonably  ,   the Bible doesn't make for a explanation of the world
No  ,   everyone can believe what they want what it is is that they try to impose their beliefs to everyone and for the Bible  ,   for what they think
Exactly  ,   they're fundamentalisms  ,   no
Yeah  ,   fundamentalism  ,   yes  ,   yes  ,   yes  ,   from the right wing  ,   But also the country is  ,   ah  ,   the party has the power so  ,   everyone from the president to everyone who is into this  ,   at the White House  ,   they're all rightwing republicans  .  
Target of  ,   uh  ,   Christians and they are the ones that The people with power in the country  ,   the ones with the companies  ,   everyone is  ,   maybe  ,   there are a lot of rightwing republican fundamentalists who want to take the law away  .  
The right to abort  ,   the right of  ,   for example another question was  ,   homosexuality  ,   gay marriage  ,   the right to the belief of
yes  ,   more scientific  ,   no  ,   no  ,   you can't just believe what they say  ,   they say God created man and woman  ,   you also have to give a choice for kids to believe  ,  
that was Charles Darwin who came up with the theory of evolution  .   And
But
Well I think that maybe  ,   as similar as we are  ,   more problems  ,   no  .  
yes
In that sense  ,   the differences help to complement each other  .  
Yes I  ,   I'm convinced it's that because I know a lot of people that are  ,  
No
uh  ,   well homosexuals  ,   or lesbians and  ,   I'm really informed and so that's why yea I never know because  .   Ever since I was  ,   since I was a girl  ,   well  ,  
yes
They have to have the right to get married  ,   to live with whoever  .  
yes yes I agree with you  ,   exactly I think that  ,   they have all the rights  ,   because we can have any other type of person and in this cases the marriage rights are relatives
well many drive the homosexuality question as a very wicked situation and they don't have rights to marriage  ,   no really when marriage is really a contract
mhm
between two persons that stated doing something in comun  .  
No  ,  
believe that it is an abomination because marriage is define as the union between a woman & a man and believe  ,   and the  ,   people & christian fundamentalist like I said before they see it as an abomination  ,   and they are so closed mind that they don't understand that
that was before  ,   the tradicional thinking but now times have change and each one also  .    Same as before  ,   homosexuality has been always  ,   since the beginning of man but before was a way and now is   ,  
aha
People is accepting the echo from people  ,   yes like he is homosexual  ,   yes and well
right  ,   yes like there is one that is so exreme  ,   eh  ,   the family and marrige  ,   the eclesiastic institution and the blessing of God for marriage and things when in reality
well the church and religion is a way of institution  ,   like school  ,   have
right  .  
the need to change and find new ways to learn thing of life  .  
yes  ,   the religion has to be something personal  ,   no something that mix with politics  ,   each one can  ,   the  ,   think  ,   what you believe is each one  ,   doesn't have to be what  ,  
eh  ,   let's see why you don't think the same as me  ,   you are no me  ,   well  ,   like you get punish because we are diffent  ,   and shouldn't be that  ,   each person can think whatever they want  ,   believe in anything or anyone  ,   don't have  ,  
for the christians  ,   because they talk badly about the Muslims because they say they are radicals or they talk badly about  ,   the atheist because they don't believein god and they call them  heretic or   ,  
But I don't know
right
That is very christian  ,   you have to accept the people like they are  ,   and each and everyone one of them that believes or has your religion  ,   but that is the problem with the fundamentalists  ,   that they don't accept the differences  .  
you know they are very  ,   radicals  ,   no  ,   they don't accept differences because they were raised in a manner that their parents taught them  ,   so
yes
and for example  ,   I had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of different races  ,   cultures  ,   so I am very open to everything  .  
But is that there are classes there are mu  people of different classes  ,   and well  ,   there has to be radicals Christians there has to be everything  ,   but I think that yes  ,   religion does influence the country  ,   yes  .  
saying how to do things in the country and that's why there is such a polemic with marriages also there is with the  ,   with the supreme court with  ,   with  ,   the judges that they want them to be from the right also and that they are religious well  ,   they
to be or Catholic or that they are also they want that  ,   that they take away the right to abortion and things like that  ,   that is  ,   is ridiculous at this stage of the century  .  
But  ,   that's how we are now  .  
I in my family are from  ,   in Spain I'm Cat  Catholicism let's say it's as soon as you're born they baptize you  ,   first communion and all that  ,   so I got married in the Church
Sure  .  
yes
But  ,   Let's say faith  ,   it is each one  ,   I don't know that each person is free to believe what he wants  ,   and practice it  ,   but respecting others who are not the same  .  
aha
Because there are many religions and what happens is that the Christian religion is the most let's say abundant in the world  ,   it is the more  ,   the one that has the power on everything
Because in the world we have  ,   on this side of the world no  ,   because I believe that I only believe that not even the majority of Christians  ,   I believe there are more Muslims than Christians  .  
Yes but they don't have as much economic power  ,   that is the problem  .  
Hi  ,   good night  .  
Good night  .   My name is Carolina  .  
of Los Angeles  .  
Aha  .  
Gladly  .  
I'm from Peru  .  
Oh  ,   okay  .  
Eh  ,   I am from the Columbian residence  .  
Mhm  .  
Because here people speak Mexican Spanish
Yes
Right  .  
you stick to the  ,   you stick to the accent from where you live  .  
With the  ,   when I lived in Spain it got stuck the   ,   the Spanish accent
Mhm  .  
Mm  .   Mhm  .  
That it is what it is spoken here
Yeah  .   yes  .  
yes  .  
yes  ,   oh I use  ,   I use computers
Already  .  
Mhm  .  
Mhm  .   Already  ,  
I like to do it fast and  ,   and before that  ,   when it had the line  ,  
by telephone
yes  .  
it was very slow  .  
and until now  ,   you can carry a webcam  ,   and  ,   and the webcam
comes fast with the DSL
Already  ,   safe  .  
It is fast  .  
Well  ,   for me  ,   also  ,   of course and I work  ,   my jo   ,   I am an administrator and then eh  ,   my job I use and for me the computer  ,   that is
yes  .  
So  ,   the truth is that I have adapted very well and I love it since I've been using the computer  ,   because well before I used a type writer that was so slow to
Mm  ,   of course  ,   I believe that  ,   they have  ,   e   ,   they have made more a  advancements in the computer that they have mane in  ,   with medicine  .  
That's true  .  
The computer is the most advanced of civilization now  .  
yes  .  
want you find it there and well when one sits down in front of well  ,   i use it for my work  ,   but well also when I'm at home and I need
yes  ,   exactly  .  
For everything  ,   because if you need to know what the temperature is outside  ,   well you go to the computer  .  
News  ,   sports  .  
Before it was yes  ,   mhm  .  
yes  ,  yes  ,  yes  .  
Oh  ,   also  ,   yes  ,   oh
Yes  ,   almost mm  ,   then the computer has a lot of influence  .  
In our lifes  ,   twenty two  ,  this is my hm  ,   twenty second call  .  
I almost need about three  ,   but one call that the person spoke more in english  ,  I think is going to have a replacement  .  
Now  ,  mhm
Because I spoke in spanish  ,   then they should consider  .  
mhm  ,   now  .  
Yes  ,  you do one call to replace  .  
I went to speak to him  ,   I know the owner of this  .  
and  ,   and I am going to ask if it will be on me to replace it  .  
yes  .  
No  ,   he must be in Philadelphia
Oh  ,   I see  ,   I see  ,   I see
but  ,   but he gave me his ph 
No  ,   no  ,   no  ,   no  .  
Oh  ,   just through the computer
yes  ,   I know him through the computer  ,   but he
through the internet  ,   I see  ,   aha
but he  ,   he talks with people that are participating
yes  ,   then if you have any questions you can him  ,   he is Chinese
yes  ,   wel   ,   I don't know if he is the owner  ,   he is
Oh  .  
him  ,   the manager
yes
yes  ,   that  ,   for supervisor  ,   of the project they are doing
Ok  ,   ok  ,   OK
yes  ,   they are studying the way we talk Spanish
Ok  ,   right and
Don't know  ,   you heard that
yeas  ,   yes i did  ,   and i think that they will start another one after they finish this one  .  
No  ,   i don't know  ,   most probably they do  ,   because i  ,   i already did two  .  
Mhm
On in English and another in Spanish
yes  ,   and what we're doing right now is technology
Oh  ,   oh  .  
because they are doing phone line connections
and this is technology yes  ,   something like that  ,   was the same thing  ,    but in English
Yeah they paid the same
Oh  ,   ok  ,   OK
Yes  ,   I like to do this not only for the payment  ,   but for the opportunity given to me  .  
Ah  ,   good  .  
to speak in Spanish
Of course  .  
Mm  ,   yes  .  
Yes  .  
And what
Goo  Yes  ,   of course it is  .  
because they are using multiple telephone lines to connect many people living in different parts of the country  .  
ah  ,   a monthly fee
Yeah  .  
Oh  ,   but here in
And that wasn't  ,   that wasn't like that in five or ten  ,   twenty years  .  
Here in the United States  ,   yes
Oh ya  ,   ofcourse  ,   yes  ,   yes  ,   justifiably I have just received ah  ,   from Verizon that they are offering me free calls here in the United States
yes  .  
if they charge you something monthly  ,   but if you make a lot of calls  ,   it's worthwhile  .  
Ah  ,   how good it was  .  
You pay a monthly quote and you can make the calls you want  .  
yes  .  
Now you can talk three four or five hours for five dollars  .  
Before it was one minute  ,   oh my god it was like eight
One minute was twenty cents  ,   yes
And yes  ,   I remember that I had to talk  ,   I think that just ten minutes was  ,   it cost me like twenty five dollars  .  
yes  ,   yes  ,   yes that has happened to me too
yes  ,   aha
that yes  ,   yes  ,   yes  ,   ah  ,   I know that yes  ,   what it is  ,   you have to be with the clock
Aha  .   Of course  .    Ah  ,   yes
What happens is that like it is advancing and technology is in the hands of  ,   of more people
Mmh  .   Mmh
then services are cheaper  ,   because they sell to more people
Na  Sure  ,   yes
mhm  ,   of course  .  
eh  ,   for example  ,   the computer  ,   the computer a few years ago was worth one or two thousand dollars  .  
of course  ,   of course  ,   ha
because technology has adavanced  .  
what i would like to see is
yeah
more advanced technology  ,   with medicine  .  
true  .  
mm  ,   mm
i want to see more advances in medicine  ,   i think their going slow in that area  .  
Mm  .   Mm  .  
A  yes  ,   yes  ,   yes  .  
Or  ,   or heart disease as well  .  
AIDS is more advanced than cancer  ,   in  ,   in
Well  ,   that's if  .  
in the sense of control because you have to have the drugs to fight it  .  
But the cancer is very slow I think  .  
No  ,   no  ,   no it's not true  .  
I nothing  .   Nothing  .  
yes
that could be improved
Well  ,   well
yes  .  
yes  ,   yes  ,  
It can happen to any person
I  ,   I had a friend that died very young  ,   at thirty two years of age  ,   and got cancer from one day to another  .  
yes  ,   because she got  cerebral bleeding
Oh  ,   my God  .  
oh  ,   yea  ,  
and of that  ,   she got it from one day to the next
Oh my God  .

Do you have teenagers?

Ay, I was thinking, my god, how can it be? Hey, today we got a very difficult subject

I wanted to say, that, so later they have said a few stupid things, no?
and you try to tell the other person, look it's like this, like this.. don't you realize?  And then they tell you no, because you are
Exactly, that is what they tell me sometimes, "what are you doing here?
because, what do you do over here ? all right, could be same as you, thank God. You being here, and not in Venezuela
for really unusual high price, the people can't cope with that, they don't protest either, and i say, my God, what's happening with all those people?, like

and they said, no, girl, what is that? Look, and I, damn really, but look the power of television is
Of course, of course, what do you do there in Philadelphia?
Oh, and do you think it is best over there than in Miami?
And, what are we going to do?  That is, work is the main thing.
Of course, of course, and fi- and come over here  And what do you do?
But, and do you have much time here in the United States?

yes?

what?
That´s good. It´s better.What for? Trouble, to get in trouble
And you?
yes, and how does that happened to you?
Are you married now?
Eh, What else? Let's see which other one. After that I didn't have any other formal boyfriend until S- yes, the truth is I never had any bad experiences I don't know, really? Thank God.
I think that must be one of the worse, I think, experiences, yes, I hope, I hope I never have to go through that cause we don't know, right?
it's impossible to have a perfect relationship, right? A situation in which
yes, one loves the person but it's impossible to be at peace all the time, that's what I mean, right?
Because one, then I, I am one, is a human being and one has to, things that bother to other people, right? and
yes, the truth I fe-, I think it has to be some truth, eh it's difficult eh, keep all happy, right? but
that, of course, you don't fully know, right? until you get married with that person but I think that I think
the drama is al-eh lots really? and then the people don't know how to get out the cycle of ,of abuse is what happens
And i told her, now your wearing glasses? and she had a black eye because her boyfriend hit her.
and then i said wow, what? how can you love a person that hits you? she sometimes came with bruises or sometimes
What's up Fabiola?, How are you?

yes, yes, yes. Now I'm- it's important orally. No? I'm like in the mid- at the other extreme of the of, of, mm, of the, mm,
And ho-? To speak?
But, definetively they'll have that option, then. And even, eh, there are paretns that combine, the signal language with the oral part, No? depending on
What do you think about, about the subject they gave us of the-?
eh, sometimes is a little bit difficult, no? But, I think love is the only thing that can make overcome these barriers, nothing else
are overcome, what do you think?
and twelve, imagine that, i mean we've had critical moments but, never enough to separate, and there's a time where maturity plays a big role, right?
As I say, if I fall down, i just put myself up, What's the problem?
Exactly, the luckily, well, the first time was horrible, I thought it was the end of the world. And well, there we stood and we weren't treating each other fine, until one day, i said, well, what's going on?
horrible, really horrible, I said, look, you know what?, I think
Because, what will we do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre relationship. As you say, there are some people who spend up to 30 years together, and in a crappy relationship
yes?
They, they mistreat each other. Like, you piece of who knows what, like, what's that? Why would I want-?
Right? you just respect, and
right?and there's some that say, that love, yes theres no love, no nothing.
of course of course, is your husband from chile?
you think it's easier?
and what, what's what you said?
what do you say? or when we're super b-
Hi, hi, how are you?
Oh, how are you?
Fine, and you?
That's great, and where are you originally... ?
Right? Me too
Really?
And how long have you been living here?
and his name?, and then came and went clear but more or less in the ninety-one , and you?
and you, where you from?
from Santiago too?
and some time you are in this? call by phone?
oh yes?
Hello?
Oh, are you already calling everyday?
Ah, why union shouldn't be or why one doesn't want to do it?
Yea. Yes, and do you like it here?
yes, well. and as but roamed beyond people use as car or more action?
and they tried to speak to me in Arab, I don't know. They found my face to be more Indian or something, but of course. Is there discrimination there or no?
And how did you end up in Idaho?
yes. I married a gringo, that's how I came here.  And you how, how?
oh really?
And so you're single now?
okay Ah, look. And what's this called, do you like it or not?
Hi, ¿how are you?, my name is Juan, Marcela.
Yeah, ¿how're you doing?
Hey, ¿didn't we talk the other day with?
I haven't forgotten you. We practiced together, ¿right?, Hey, but today's heath.
¿Do you have insurance here?, ¿are you covered?
That's a problem, right?
We're not covered. It's a problem, because there's always something that could happen, right?
people from the community, right?
to give information about the person that was hiring me and at that time well, that person didn't want to give the information, no?
and didn't they give you, eh, the attention?
no? yes, he gave me. Then yes, it's something that we thing about that well, there should be some type of more flexible, no, in order to well in case there is for the community but it's a certain type of community.
because there is more demand and because people pay for it. And so the costs keep on going up because people ask for more money. And the people that work ask for more money, it's a vicious circle. And so how can you all of a sudden create a social medicine?
Exactly.  It is a problem, it is a circle that works with earnings here they are stronger, no?
With that.  Because here I don't know there where you are living.  But, here if someone has money it is nurses and doctors.  No?
Then.  Mm. And well here as they say, you see a good car with a woman who is thirty, for example, no?
yes, yes I Uh uh.  Then who in this case well it is offered.  In Canada I understand well they have much medicine, no?
All their medicines are paid, they pay a little, ¿right?, but very little.
It's expensive, ¿right?; And then, i don't know how the medications are here, but well, in Mexico they're cheaper and its more like that
no? yes yes and here there is only one. And secondly the literature isn't the best. And if it is only the laboratories, and I think that all the NorthAmerican laboratories well eh
Strong interest in all, no?
Why don't you put yourself in contact with an organization that is called Shriners?
yes I knew that.  Hey, we ran out of time or what?
with the epilepsy, right?
right? then you know one is always hoping that it doesn't happen. Well I don't really know what really is going to happen, but right it does cause trauma, but poor son of mine because he is a teenager so
Sure, because on top of that he feels embarrassed. Look, how old is he?
yes, it's a stigma. It's a stigma. What he has, no? then
How old is he?
yes. Do you know where you can ask around? in the teaching hospitals
they'll see people that, that can't pay in a normal situation, you know? Like us who can't go to a specialized doctor because it's too expensive
Ah, yes?
with the University. Ah?
Mm. Uh uh.  Then, they told me no well you have to bring us information.  I had a letter about my income, etc., no?
no? wel not I.  But well then now I have my social security, myself.
Hello, how are you? my name is Juan
yes, how, how have you been?
listen, well all good this, what do you think about today's topic?
no, I didn't hear it, what is the topic?
and how do you consider the matter of technology, no?, your daily life, if it becomes more of a problem than a solution or something like that
this includes, automobiles, cars?
it is the same that, it is the same I was thinking, clearly, they should include it, no?
yes because it is a, you know? a machine
exactly, well, but, I said well yes, the automobile seems to be the most important, no?, it is- then I thought maybe it is the computer, but no
aha, exactly but sometimes, eh, what seems like a more personal element depending on the case, well it can be the car, no? because the computer is more and more another tool
well more than, than, sometimes, let's say that it belongs to the institution in which you are, no? it is more a work tool
but a tool like very personal seems to be the car, no?
because, you have to be careful with the car and, you know?
did you use horses more?
no? is like a horse, it is something like very, very, very personal, very closed
to, to your life. here take care of them and the is as important as, let't say, as the horse at that time, no?
eh, everything that allows the handling of the information and everything, right?
You need the car, you know? to, to work
exactly and here working people have like in that times like a mule, no? they need a a, a pick up a, truck pick up
really?, yes, yes
pick up truck, right? and listen, and it does not leave them, then is, eh, it is evident, like it is a hard work culture very, very important
and the computers, well, in every home there's television, telephone and computers basically, isn't it? but but like there are other dimensions of the technological cuestion, then the automobile seems to be
ah, what a- what technical, technological question is more important in your life? that's what we're discussing right now, if it should be the automobile or the computer, what do you think?
because, you know? because i have my cell phone and I'm always with it
and, well I've grown accustomed to having a cellphone, you know?
not always going back home for for, you know? seeing my messages
yes notice that it is, it's verry important what you just said, some time ago when i was working i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important thing, was it?
and well, on the computer were the messages, there was always the internet, the mails more than the phone, the cellphone, anything, right?
more phisical,no? then the car becomes the most important tool and the computer well, in a second plan even though it is also very important no?
well for me I believe that well you and you where around Texas and obiously you know that there is more how you say? i understand that there is more buildings and stuff around there you know?
is more of a problem then a help because a help but obviously you know? obviously
ah,yes?
but yes and in the city I believe the most imortant and depending on your work also well eh could be the computer no? then
the the other question o,o the tools of communication no? like you say the cellular.
well, what kind of problems could he have, right? like you said, with the car, the problems that have to do with the parking.
no? here in Texas no, there isn't, where I'm from there is not  major problems, no?, with the parking there is a lot of space everywhere, he hasn't presented
of transport, right? for example
charged their development costs, you understand me? I can't explain it very well but
Exactly yes, well like they say too, with the motor industry, right? if the motor industry would have advanced technologically much like the electronic industry then maybe an automobile will let us transport like
right? and instead of costing like twenty thousand dollars, it would only cost ten thousand dollars.
if that was the case, no? but, like the technology, in this case the industry, has their interests well no, like it does not advance, no? you can see already what they are saying now about the hybrids.
no?, no, I don't think that they have a real, a real, ehm that it is really a change like that very importanttechnological given the efficiency that
pardon?
no, I don't think that it is that important at the same time that the efficiency they have proven is not radically different to the ones others have it is very little, no? you see, I say
the pick up trucks are good they are changing to be more efficient you know?
but the expedition those cars are big so they are expensive you know? only they can go twenty miles, ten and eight miles per galon or something like that that's a huge expense
yes exactly  but at the same time cars like this, there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance that hybrids and they aren't hybrids no?
and smaller no? then if we compare with the spend of a hybrid against a small Europe car or those that run in latinoamerica so
How are you?
Good and yourself? How is the weather like in your house?
Over here weather is ugly, it is cold.  What do you think about the movies? Have you talked already about this topic?
is because you let him/her and you thought it could be, is that right?
I was asking myself, ah how is this? are you getting ready for Christmas yet?
What did you buy Miranda?
And you know who else has a birthday coming?
Yeah, who?
who?
yes, it's true, who?
Jua, Juan Luis is the eldest or the youngest?
Tamara, ¿how are you?, uh
Yeah, ¿and you?
Fine, fine. ¿Uh, where are you?
Yeah, you caught me off guard. But, ¿have you been participating long in this?
Didn't you, you got the same email, ¿right?, i mean, that apparently this will continue, you see, according to what i understood from the email they sent me.
Then, what do you think about what they show in the movies?
Say? Well I will tell you honestly, it's been more than a year since we stopped watching movies movies in the regular cinema and we move to the cinema
We moved to the cinema, for example in case of cinema, no? same as the one on television. Now we watch movies like Documentaries. Well... eh, with a different type of message.
Watch movies that are on on eh, what do you call it? the festivals, there we go for example, the recently finished International Festival of Latinamerican Cinema
upid, so dum that I felt bad to be there in the movie theater. I, well, what are we doing here? What a waste of time this is
What are you doing, right? I mean to watch that, really I prefer aco- lay down and go to sleep or I'd rather do something else instead of of, no I'm saying all of the movies, there are some that have a
uh huh, like great we have to make ten movies; we're going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter what? When? How it turns out, to the
forget about it, like we say, where are you from?
but then they repeat and repeat and repeat. Ay My God! What is this? we are paying for this then it's like an annoyance, right now we have like an annoyance with
And we were there and my husband, you know? this white man, paper white compared to my father and my mother is white so I left more than my father, so
and say hey, weren't we there this morning? i don't remember seeing that this morning.
he was there and people was protesting, Why?, the current President didn't do anything to remember the local victims
Hello?
Hello Fernanda How are you? My name is Claudia
How are you?
Where are you from? Good. How are you speaking?
and you're from, where are you from?
I think that hm the Americans are, not like the mo- standard morals have decreased, You understand me? then
But for example, I had one, one time cable and sometimes was,well, what you like? ten in the morning, eleven and well I like to be changing the channel.
because, ca-can be, let's say ten at night and the series on air never are so, you don't take the risk, do you? to be too poor like here. Here
oh, yes?
well what they see. no? in that aspect. But, uf
The way things are going soon even the ones from Disney, perhaps will have pornography, right? So
Because sometimes they even draw it. I don't know if you've seen commercials like that. All the same it doesn't scare you because you're already big, right? but
and even one gets used to it, do you understand me? let's say
Maybe it's... Mariza, we spoke to each other a few days ago, right?
Hey, well, today's subject is, the matter of religion, right?
Give an answer for. And it ends up being some form of control, right?
That, well, they represented a whole project of, ideology, but they really, they're one of the most conservative groups there are in the United States, right?
¿Really?
And against the theory, that they try to teach the theory about evolution, ¿right?
No, terrible, they said ¿why are they harassing teachers that teach the bible to explain how the world was created?
Right, they're fundamentalists, right?
yeah, more scientific right?, no, you don't have to believe only in what they say, they say god created man and woman, but also to give children a choice to believe
Well yes, but in this case, accepting differences seems to be related to humanity, eh?
yeah and you have? do you practice a particular religion?
Ah, how are you Carolina? You are speaking with Alex
What's up Alex?
Oh, okay, I thought that that, that you were someone else. Are you well?
Where are you from?

Columbian?
many many things, and and I don't like to wait for the pages, you understand?
And you?
The most essential, and mainly in the new techniques, right? the new technology that has arrived and every day new things come out, right?
write documents and forms, and all, now everything is done in the computer and the internet, right? it's something fascinating.
right, yes and for everything, right? that is it's everything that one
some information, but I sit down in the computer and there is not one to stop me, I don't know, it's like something, something essential and part of ones lifestyle, right?
yes, right. And how many calls have you made already?
But, but, who knows?
But, the payment is made after you finish the 25 calls, right?
Oh, yes?
Oh, Do you know the owner?
Oh, is he from California?
Oh, but you know him personally?
Oh, really?, i never talk with him.
Oh, yes?
oh, this is your second one, yes?
yeah, yeah, oh, and the other one was the same, twenty-five calls?

And what kind of technology do you use? What we are doing now is technology.
And you know what? Some day they are also going to make international to you favorite country.
How good would that be, right? yeah, that would be excellent for calling to the country whenever you wanted I think that if you're going to arrive, because with one of those cards also, right? Every day
before it was really expensive. You remember how it was? To call to the country
And now it's cheaper, right?
And why is it so cheap? Because of the technology.
and I had to be very careful and have the clock right in front of me, no?
yes, I've had, the truth is that, I hope that technology keeps advancing, I would say that in ten years time, what else will they come up with, no?
Because all that must keep on advancing, no?
do you get me?
they have to find cures for like cancer, if you can go to the moon, why can't they find a cure for cancer? I'm sure they can, if they can make
a super fast computer that can think, why can't they find a cure for cancer?
It's  true, because how long has cancer been around?
yes, and how many people it kills, ¿right?
and they can't find a cure for it, ¿right?, and they cand find it, ¿right?
¿Right?, and that shortens life for a lot of people.
¿Have you heard about a discovery of cancer?
I wish, no? I wish that something comes out, that that God enlightens us, so that when they find something that can eh, heal, for this catastrophe that is when cancer comes, it doesn't matter at what age, but it comes, no?

Do you have teenagers?

Ay, I was thinking, my god, how can it be? Hey, today we got a very difficult subject

I wanted to say, that, so later they have said a few stupid things, no?
and you try to tell the other person, look it's like this, like this.. don't you realize?  And then they tell you no, because you are
Exactly, that is what they tell me sometimes, "what are you doing here?

Are you married now?
Eh, What else? Let's see which other one. After that I didn't have any other formal boyfriend until S- yes, the truth is I never had any bad experiences I don't know, really? Thank God.
I think that must be one of the worse, I think, experiences, yes, I hope, I hope I never have to go through that cause we don't know, right?
it's impossible to have a perfect relationship, right? A situation in which
yes, one loves the person but it's impossible to be at peace all the time, that's what I mean, right?
Because one, then I, I am one, is a human being and one has to, things that bother to other people, right? and
yes, the truth I fe-, I think it has to be some truth, eh it's difficult eh, keep all happy, right? but
that, of course, you don't fully know, right? until you get married with that person but I think that I think
the drama is al-eh lots really? and then the people don't know how to get out the cycle of ,of abuse is what happens
And i told her, now your wearing glasses? and she had a black eye because her boyfriend hit her.
and then i said wow, what? how can you love a person that hits you? she sometimes came with bruises or sometimes

And ho-? To speak?
But, definetively they'll have that option, then. And even, eh, there are paretns that combine, the signal language with the oral part, No? depending on
What do you think about, about the subject they gave us of the-?
eh, sometimes is a little bit difficult, no? But, I think love is the only thing that can make overcome these barriers, nothing else
are overcome, what do you think?
and twelve, imagine that, i mean we've had critical moments but, never enough to separate, and there's a time where maturity plays a big role, right?
As I say, if I fall down, i just put myself up, What's the problem?
Exactly, the luckily, well, the first time was horrible, I thought it was the end of the world. And well, there we stood and we weren't treating each other fine, until one day, i said, well, what's going on?
horrible, really horrible, I said, look, you know what?, I think
Because, what will we do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre relationship. As you say, there are some people who spend up to 30 years together, and in a crappy relationship
yes?
They, they mistreat each other. Like, you piece of who knows what, like, what's that? Why would I want-?
Right? you just respect, and
right?and there's some that say, that love, yes theres no love, no nothing.
of course of course, is your husband from chile?
you think it's easier?
and what, what's what you said?
what do you say? or when we're super b-
Hi, hi, how are you?
Oh, how are you?
Fine, and you?
That's great, and where are you originally... ?
Right? Me too
Really?
And how long have you been living here?
and his name?, and then came and went clear but more or less in the ninety-one , and you?
and you, where you from?
from Santiago too?
and some time you are in this? call by phone?
oh yes?
Hello?
Oh, are you already calling everyday?
Ah, why union shouldn't be or why one doesn't want to do it?
Yea. Yes, and do you like it here?
yes, well. and as but roamed beyond people use as car or more action?
and they tried to speak to me in Arab, I don't know. They found my face to be more Indian or something, but of course. Is there discrimination there or no?
And how did you end up in Idaho?
yes. I married a gringo, that's how I came here.  And you how, how?
oh really?
And so you're single now?
okay Ah, look. And what's this called, do you like it or not?
Hi, ¿how are you?, my name is Juan, Marcela.
Yeah, ¿how're you doing?
Hey, ¿didn't we talk the other day with?
I haven't forgotten you. We practiced together, ¿right?, Hey, but today's heath.
¿Do you have insurance here?, ¿are you covered?
That's a problem, right?
We're not covered. It's a problem, because there's always something that could happen, right?
people from the community, right?
to give information about the person that was hiring me and at that time well, that person didn't want to give the information, no?
and didn't they give you, eh, the attention?
no? yes, he gave me. Then yes, it's something that we thing about that well, there should be some type of more flexible, no, in order to well in case there is for the community but it's a certain type of community.
because there is more demand and because people pay for it. And so the costs keep on going up because people ask for more money. And the people that work ask for more money, it's a vicious circle. And so how can you all of a sudden create a social medicine?
Exactly.  It is a problem, it is a circle that works with earnings here they are stronger, no?
With that.  Because here I don't know there where you are living.  But, here if someone has money it is nurses and doctors.  No?
Then.  Mm. And well here as they say, you see a good car with a woman who is thirty, for example, no?
yes, yes I Uh uh.  Then who in this case well it is offered.  In Canada I understand well they have much medicine, no?
All their medicines are paid, they pay a little, ¿right?, but very little.
It's expensive, ¿right?; And then, i don't know how the medications are here, but well, in Mexico they're cheaper and its more like that
no? yes yes and here there is only one. And secondly the literature isn't the best. And if it is only the laboratories, and I think that all the NorthAmerican laboratories well eh
Strong interest in all, no?
Why don't you put yourself in contact with an organization that is called Shriners?
yes I knew that.  Hey, we ran out of time or what?
with the epilepsy, right?
right? then you know one is always hoping that it doesn't happen. Well I don't really know what really is going to happen, but right it does cause trauma, but poor son of mine because he is a teenager so
Sure, because on top of that he feels embarrassed. Look, how old is he?
yes, it's a stigma. It's a stigma. What he has, no? then
How old is he?
yes. Do you know where you can ask around? in the teaching hospitals
they'll see people that, that can't pay in a normal situation, you know? Like us who can't go to a specialized doctor because it's too expensive
Ah, yes?
with the University. Ah?
Mm. Uh uh.  Then, they told me no well you have to bring us information.  I had a letter about my income, etc., no?
no? wel not I.  But well then now I have my social security, myself.
Hello, how are you? my name is Juan
yes, how, how have you been?
listen, well all good this, what do you think about today's topic?
no, I didn't hear it, what is the topic?
and how do you consider the matter of technology, no?, your daily life, if it becomes more of a problem than a solution or something like that
this includes, automobiles, cars?
it is the same that, it is the same I was thinking, clearly, they should include it, no?
yes because it is a, you know? a machine
exactly, well, but, I said well yes, the automobile seems to be the most important, no?, it is- then I thought maybe it is the computer, but no
aha, exactly but sometimes, eh, what seems like a more personal element depending on the case, well it can be the car, no? because the computer is more and more another tool
well more than, than, sometimes, let's say that it belongs to the institution in which you are, no? it is more a work tool
but a tool like very personal seems to be the car, no?
because, you have to be careful with the car and, you know?
did you use horses more?
no? is like a horse, it is something like very, very, very personal, very closed
to, to your life. here take care of them and the is as important as, let't say, as the horse at that time, no?
eh, everything that allows the handling of the information and everything, right?
You need the car, you know? to, to work
exactly and here working people have like in that times like a mule, no? they need a a, a pick up a, truck pick up
really?, yes, yes
pick up truck, right? and listen, and it does not leave them, then is, eh, it is evident, like it is a hard work culture very, very important
and the computers, well, in every home there's television, telephone and computers basically, isn't it? but but like there are other dimensions of the technological cuestion, then the automobile seems to be
ah, what a- what technical, technological question is more important in your life? that's what we're discussing right now, if it should be the automobile or the computer, what do you think?
because, you know? because i have my cell phone and I'm always with it
and, well I've grown accustomed to having a cellphone, you know?
not always going back home for for, you know? seeing my messages
yes notice that it is, it's verry important what you just said, some time ago when i was working i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important thing, was it?
and well, on the computer were the messages, there was always the internet, the mails more than the phone, the cellphone, anything, right?
more phisical,no? then the car becomes the most important tool and the computer well, in a second plan even though it is also very important no?
well for me I believe that well you and you where around Texas and obiously you know that there is more how you say? i understand that there is more buildings and stuff around there you know?
is more of a problem then a help because a help but obviously you know? obviously
ah,yes?
but yes and in the city I believe the most imortant and depending on your work also well eh could be the computer no? then
the the other question o,o the tools of communication no? like you say the cellular.
well, what kind of problems could he have, right? like you said, with the car, the problems that have to do with the parking.
no? here in Texas no, there isn't, where I'm from there is not  major problems, no?, with the parking there is a lot of space everywhere, he hasn't presented
of transport, right? for example
charged their development costs, you understand me? I can't explain it very well but
Exactly yes, well like they say too, with the motor industry, right? if the motor industry would have advanced technologically much like the electronic industry then maybe an automobile will let us transport like
right? and instead of costing like twenty thousand dollars, it would only cost ten thousand dollars.
if that was the case, no? but, like the technology, in this case the industry, has their interests well no, like it does not advance, no? you can see already what they are saying now about the hybrids.
no?, no, I don't think that they have a real, a real, ehm that it is really a change like that very importanttechnological given the efficiency that
pardon?
no, I don't think that it is that important at the same time that the efficiency they have proven is not radically different to the ones others have it is very little, no? you see, I say
the pick up trucks are good they are changing to be more efficient you know?
but the expedition those cars are big so they are expensive you know? only they can go twenty miles, ten and eight miles per galon or something like that that's a huge expense
yes exactly  but at the same time cars like this, there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance that hybrids and they aren't hybrids no?
and smaller no? then if we compare with the spend of a hybrid against a small Europe car or those that run in latinoamerica so
How are you?
Good and yourself? How is the weather like in your house?
Over here weather is ugly, it is cold.  What do you think about the movies? Have you talked already about this topic?
is because you let him/her and you thought it could be, is that right?
I was asking myself, ah how is this? are you getting ready for Christmas yet?
What did you buy Miranda?
And you know who else has a birthday coming?
Yeah, who?
who?
yes, it's true, who?
Jua, Juan Luis is the eldest or the youngest?
Tamara, ¿how are you?, uh
Yeah, ¿and you?
Fine, fine. ¿Uh, where are you?
Yeah, you caught me off guard. But, ¿have you been participating long in this?
Didn't you, you got the same email, ¿right?, i mean, that apparently this will continue, you see, according to what i understood from the email they sent me.
Then, what do you think about what they show in the movies?
Say? Well I will tell you honestly, it's been more than a year since we stopped watching movies movies in the regular cinema and we move to the cinema
We moved to the cinema, for example in case of cinema, no? same as the one on television. Now we watch movies like Documentaries. Well... eh, with a different type of message.
Watch movies that are on on eh, what do you call it? the festivals, there we go for example, the recently finished International Festival of Latinamerican Cinema
upid, so dum that I felt bad to be there in the movie theater. I, well, what are we doing here? What a waste of time this is
What are you doing, right? I mean to watch that, really I prefer aco- lay down and go to sleep or I'd rather do something else instead of of, no I'm saying all of the movies, there are some that have a
uh huh, like great we have to make ten movies; we're going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter what? When? How it turns out, to the
forget about it, like we say, where are you from?
but then they repeat and repeat and repeat. Ay My God! What is this? we are paying for this then it's like an annoyance, right now we have like an annoyance with
And we were there and my husband, you know? this white man, paper white compared to my father and my mother is white so I left more than my father, so
and say hey, weren't we there this morning? i don't remember seeing that this morning.
he was there and people was protesting, Why?, the current President didn't do anything to remember the local victims
Hello?
Hello Fernanda How are you? My name is Claudia
How are you?
Where are you from? Good. How are you speaking?
and you're from, where are you from?
I think that hm the Americans are, not like the mo- standard morals have decreased, You understand me? then
But for example, I had one, one time cable and sometimes was,well, what you like? ten in the morning, eleven and well I like to be changing the channel.
because, ca-can be, let's say ten at night and the series on air never are so, you don't take the risk, do you? to be too poor like here. Here
oh, yes?
well what they see. no? in that aspect. But, uf
The way things are going soon even the ones from Disney, perhaps will have pornography, right? So
Because sometimes they even draw it. I don't know if you've seen commercials like that. All the same it doesn't scare you because you're already big, right? but
and even one gets used to it, do you understand me? let's say
Maybe it's... Mariza, we spoke to each other a few days ago, right?
Hey, well, today's subject is, the matter of religion, right?
Give an answer for. And it ends up being some form of control, right?
That, well, they represented a whole project of, ideology, but they really, they're one of the most conservative groups there are in the United States, right?
¿Really?
And against the theory, that they try to teach the theory about evolution, ¿right?
No, terrible, they said ¿why are they harassing teachers that teach the bible to explain how the world was created?
Right, they're fundamentalists, right?
yeah, more scientific right?, no, you don't have to believe only in what they say, they say god created man and woman, but also to give children a choice to believe
Well yes, but in this case, accepting differences seems to be related to humanity, eh?
yeah and you have? do you practice a particular religion?
Ah, how are you Carolina? You are speaking with Alex
What's up Alex?
Oh, okay, I thought that that, that you were someone else. Are you well?
Where are you from?
And you?
Columbian?
many many things, and and I don't like to wait for the pages, you understand?
And you?
The most essential, and mainly in the new techniques, right? the new technology that has arrived and every day new things come out, right?
write documents and forms, and all, now everything is done in the computer and the internet, right? it's something fascinating.
right, yes and for everything, right? that is it's everything that one
some information, but I sit down in the computer and there is not one to stop me, I don't know, it's like something, something essential and part of ones lifestyle, right?
yes, right. And how many calls have you made already?
But, but, who knows?
But, the payment is made after you finish the 25 calls, right?
Oh, yes?
Oh, Do you know the owner?
Oh, is he from California?
Oh, but you know him personally?
Oh, really?, i never talk with him.
Oh, yes?
oh, this is your second one, yes?
yeah, yeah, oh, and the other one was the same, twenty-five calls?
yea, and you got paid also, the same?
And what kind of technology do you use? What we are doing now is technology.
And you know what? Some day they are also going to make international to you favorite country.
How good would that be, right? yeah, that would be excellent for calling to the country whenever you wanted I think that if you're going to arrive, because with one of those cards also, right? Every day
before it was really expensive. You remember how it was? To call to the country
And now it's cheaper, right?
And why is it so cheap? Because of the technology.
and I had to be very careful and have the clock right in front of me, no?
yes, I've had, the truth is that, I hope that technology keeps advancing, I would say that in ten years time, what else will they come up with, no?
Because all that must keep on advancing, no?
do you get me?
they have to find cures for like cancer, if you can go to the moon, why can't they find a cure for cancer? I'm sure they can, if they can make
a super fast computer that can think, why can't they find a cure for cancer?
It's  true, because how long has cancer been around?
yes, and how many people it kills, ¿right?
and they can't find a cure for it, ¿right?, and they cand find it, ¿right?
¿Right?, and that shortens life for a lot of people.
¿Have you heard about a discovery of cancer?
I wish, no? I wish that something comes out, that that God enlightens us, so that when they find something that can eh, heal, for this catastrophe that is when cancer comes, it doesn't matter at what age, but it comes, no?

Do you have teenagers?

Ay, I was thinking, my god, how can it be? Hey, today we got a very difficult subject

I wanted to say, that, so later they have said a few stupid things, no?
and you try to tell the other person, look it's like this, like this.. don't you realize?  And then they tell you no, because you are
Exactly, that is what they tell me sometimes, "what are you doing here?

it's impossible to have a perfect relationship, right? A situation in which
yes, one loves the person but it's impossible to be at peace all the time, that's what I mean, right?
Because one, then I, I am one, is a human being and one has to, things that bother to other people, right? and

What do you think about, about the subject they gave us of the-?
eh, sometimes is a little bit difficult, no? But, I think love is the only thing that can make overcome these barriers, nothing else

As I say, if I fall down, i just put myself up, What's the problem?
Exactly, the luckily, well, the first time was horrible, I thought it was the end of the world. And well, there we stood and we weren't treating each other fine, until one day, i said, well, what's going on?
horrible, really horrible, I said, look, you know what?, I think
Because, what will we do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre relationship. As you say, there are some people who spend up to 30 years together, and in a crappy relationship

Hi, hi, how are you?
Oh, how are you?
Fine, and you?
That's great, and where are you originally... ?
Right? Me too
Really?

and you, where you from?
from Santiago too?
and some time you are in this? call by phone?
oh yes?
Hello?
Oh, are you already calling everyday?
Ah, why union shouldn't be or why one doesn't want to do it?
Yea. Yes, and do you like it here?
yes, well. and as but roamed beyond people use as car or more action?
and they tried to speak to me in Arab, I don't know. They found my face to be more Indian or something, but of course. Is there discrimination there or no?
And how did you end up in Idaho?
yes. I married a gringo, that's how I came here.  And you how, how?
oh really?
And so you're single now?
okay Ah, look. And what's this called, do you like it or not?
Hi, ¿how are you?, my name is Juan, Marcela.
Yeah, ¿how're you doing?
Hey, ¿didn't we talk the other day with?
I haven't forgotten you. We practiced together, ¿right?, Hey, but today's heath.
¿Do you have insurance here?, ¿are you covered?
That's a problem, right?
We're not covered. It's a problem, because there's always something that could happen, right?
people from the community, right?
to give information about the person that was hiring me and at that time well, that person didn't want to give the information, no?
and didn't they give you, eh, the attention?
no? yes, he gave me. Then yes, it's something that we thing about that well, there should be some type of more flexible, no, in order to well in case there is for the community but it's a certain type of community.
because there is more demand and because people pay for it. And so the costs keep on going up because people ask for more money. And the people that work ask for more money, it's a vicious circle. And so how can you all of a sudden create a social medicine?
Exactly.  It is a problem, it is a circle that works with earnings here they are stronger, no?
With that.  Because here I don't know there where you are living.  But, here if someone has money it is nurses and doctors.  No?
Then.  Mm. And well here as they say, you see a good car with a woman who is thirty, for example, no?
yes, yes I Uh uh.  Then who in this case well it is offered.  In Canada I understand well they have much medicine, no?
All their medicines are paid, they pay a little, ¿right?, but very little.
It's expensive, ¿right?; And then, i don't know how the medications are here, but well, in Mexico they're cheaper and its more like that
no? yes yes and here there is only one. And secondly the literature isn't the best. And if it is only the laboratories, and I think that all the NorthAmerican laboratories well eh
Strong interest in all, no?
Why don't you put yourself in contact with an organization that is called Shriners?
yes I knew that.  Hey, we ran out of time or what?
with the epilepsy, right?
right? then you know one is always hoping that it doesn't happen. Well I don't really know what really is going to happen, but right it does cause trauma, but poor son of mine because he is a teenager so
Sure, because on top of that he feels embarrassed. Look, how old is he?
yes, it's a stigma. It's a stigma. What he has, no? then
How old is he?
yes. Do you know where you can ask around? in the teaching hospitals
they'll see people that, that can't pay in a normal situation, you know? Like us who can't go to a specialized doctor because it's too expensive
Ah, yes?
with the University. Ah?
Mm. Uh uh.  Then, they told me no well you have to bring us information.  I had a letter about my income, etc., no?
no? wel not I.  But well then now I have my social security, myself.
Hello, how are you? my name is Juan
yes, how, how have you been?
listen, well all good this, what do you think about today's topic?
no, I didn't hear it, what is the topic?
and how do you consider the matter of technology, no?, your daily life, if it becomes more of a problem than a solution or something like that
this includes, automobiles, cars?
it is the same that, it is the same I was thinking, clearly, they should include it, no?
yes because it is a, you know? a machine
exactly, well, but, I said well yes, the automobile seems to be the most important, no?, it is- then I thought maybe it is the computer, but no
aha, exactly but sometimes, eh, what seems like a more personal element depending on the case, well it can be the car, no? because the computer is more and more another tool
well more than, than, sometimes, let's say that it belongs to the institution in which you are, no? it is more a work tool
but a tool like very personal seems to be the car, no?
because, you have to be careful with the car and, you know?
did you use horses more?
no? is like a horse, it is something like very, very, very personal, very closed
to, to your life. here take care of them and the is as important as, let't say, as the horse at that time, no?
eh, everything that allows the handling of the information and everything, right?
You need the car, you know? to, to work
exactly and here working people have like in that times like a mule, no? they need a a, a pick up a, truck pick up
really?, yes, yes
pick up truck, right? and listen, and it does not leave them, then is, eh, it is evident, like it is a hard work culture very, very important
and the computers, well, in every home there's television, telephone and computers basically, isn't it? but but like there are other dimensions of the technological cuestion, then the automobile seems to be
ah, what a- what technical, technological question is more important in your life? that's what we're discussing right now, if it should be the automobile or the computer, what do you think?
because, you know? because i have my cell phone and I'm always with it
and, well I've grown accustomed to having a cellphone, you know?
not always going back home for for, you know? seeing my messages
yes notice that it is, it's verry important what you just said, some time ago when i was working i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important thing, was it?
and well, on the computer were the messages, there was always the internet, the mails more than the phone, the cellphone, anything, right?
more phisical,no? then the car becomes the most important tool and the computer well, in a second plan even though it is also very important no?
well for me I believe that well you and you where around Texas and obiously you know that there is more how you say? i understand that there is more buildings and stuff around there you know?
is more of a problem then a help because a help but obviously you know? obviously
ah,yes?
but yes and in the city I believe the most imortant and depending on your work also well eh could be the computer no? then
the the other question o,o the tools of communication no? like you say the cellular.
well, what kind of problems could he have, right? like you said, with the car, the problems that have to do with the parking.
no? here in Texas no, there isn't, where I'm from there is not  major problems, no?, with the parking there is a lot of space everywhere, he hasn't presented
of transport, right? for example
charged their development costs, you understand me? I can't explain it very well but
Exactly yes, well like they say too, with the motor industry, right? if the motor industry would have advanced technologically much like the electronic industry then maybe an automobile will let us transport like
right? and instead of costing like twenty thousand dollars, it would only cost ten thousand dollars.
if that was the case, no? but, like the technology, in this case the industry, has their interests well no, like it does not advance, no? you can see already what they are saying now about the hybrids.
no?, no, I don't think that they have a real, a real, ehm that it is really a change like that very importanttechnological given the efficiency that
pardon?
no, I don't think that it is that important at the same time that the efficiency they have proven is not radically different to the ones others have it is very little, no? you see, I say
the pick up trucks are good they are changing to be more efficient you know?
but the expedition those cars are big so they are expensive you know? only they can go twenty miles, ten and eight miles per galon or something like that that's a huge expense
yes exactly  but at the same time cars like this, there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance that hybrids and they aren't hybrids no?
and smaller no? then if we compare with the spend of a hybrid against a small Europe car or those that run in latinoamerica so
How are you?
Good and yourself? How is the weather like in your house?
Over here weather is ugly, it is cold.  What do you think about the movies? Have you talked already about this topic?
is because you let him/her and you thought it could be, is that right?
I was asking myself, ah how is this? are you getting ready for Christmas yet?
What did you buy Miranda?
And you know who else has a birthday coming?
Yeah, who?

yes, it's true, who?
Jua, Juan Luis is the eldest or the youngest?
Tamara, ¿how are you?, uh
Yeah, ¿and you?
Fine, fine. ¿Uh, where are you?
Yeah, you caught me off guard. But, ¿have you been participating long in this?
Didn't you, you got the same email, ¿right?, i mean, that apparently this will continue, you see, according to what i understood from the email they sent me.
Then, what do you think about what they show in the movies?
Say? Well I will tell you honestly, it's been more than a year since we stopped watching movies movies in the regular cinema and we move to the cinema
We moved to the cinema, for example in case of cinema, no? same as the one on television. Now we watch movies like Documentaries. Well... eh, with a different type of message.
Watch movies that are on on eh, what do you call it? the festivals, there we go for example, the recently finished International Festival of Latinamerican Cinema
upid, so dum that I felt bad to be there in the movie theater. I, well, what are we doing here? What a waste of time this is
What are you doing, right? I mean to watch that, really I prefer aco- lay down and go to sleep or I'd rather do something else instead of of, no I'm saying all of the movies, there are some that have a
uh huh, like great we have to make ten movies; we're going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter what? When? How it turns out, to the
forget about it, like we say, where are you from?
but then they repeat and repeat and repeat. Ay My God! What is this? we are paying for this then it's like an annoyance, right now we have like an annoyance with
And we were there and my husband, you know? this white man, paper white compared to my father and my mother is white so I left more than my father, so
and say hey, weren't we there this morning? i don't remember seeing that this morning.
he was there and people was protesting, Why?, the current President didn't do anything to remember the local victims
Hello?
Hello Fernanda How are you? My name is Claudia
How are you?
Where are you from? Good. How are you speaking?
and you're from, where are you from?
I think that hm the Americans are, not like the mo- standard morals have decreased, You understand me? then
But for example, I had one, one time cable and sometimes was,well, what you like? ten in the morning, eleven and well I like to be changing the channel.
because, ca-can be, let's say ten at night and the series on air never are so, you don't take the risk, do you? to be too poor like here. Here
oh, yes?
well what they see. no? in that aspect. But, uf
The way things are going soon even the ones from Disney, perhaps will have pornography, right? So
Because sometimes they even draw it. I don't know if you've seen commercials like that. All the same it doesn't scare you because you're already big, right? but
and even one gets used to it, do you understand me? let's say
Maybe it's... Mariza, we spoke to each other a few days ago, right?
Hey, well, today's subject is, the matter of religion, right?
Give an answer for. And it ends up being some form of control, right?
That, well, they represented a whole project of, ideology, but they really, they're one of the most conservative groups there are in the United States, right?
¿Really?
And against the theory, that they try to teach the theory about evolution, ¿right?
No, terrible, they said ¿why are they harassing teachers that teach the bible to explain how the world was created?
Right, they're fundamentalists, right?
yeah, more scientific right?, no, you don't have to believe only in what they say, they say god created man and woman, but also to give children a choice to believe
Well yes, but in this case, accepting differences seems to be related to humanity, eh?
yeah and you have? do you practice a particular religion?
Ah, how are you Carolina? You are speaking with Alex
What's up Alex?
Oh, okay, I thought that that, that you were someone else. Are you well?
Where are you from?
And you?
Columbian?
many many things, and and I don't like to wait for the pages, you understand?
And you?
The most essential, and mainly in the new techniques, right? the new technology that has arrived and every day new things come out, right?
write documents and forms, and all, now everything is done in the computer and the internet, right? it's something fascinating.
right, yes and for everything, right? that is it's everything that one
some information, but I sit down in the computer and there is not one to stop me, I don't know, it's like something, something essential and part of ones lifestyle, right?
yes, right. And how many calls have you made already?
But, but, who knows?
But, the payment is made after you finish the 25 calls, right?
Oh, yes?
Oh, Do you know the owner?
Oh, is he from California?
Oh, but you know him personally?
Oh, really?, i never talk with him.
Oh, yes?
oh, this is your second one, yes?
yeah, yeah, oh, and the other one was the same, twenty-five calls?
yea, and you got paid also, the same?
And what kind of technology do you use? What we are doing now is technology.
And you know what? Some day they are also going to make international to you favorite country.
How good would that be, right? yeah, that would be excellent for calling to the country whenever you wanted I think that if you're going to arrive, because with one of those cards also, right? Every day
before it was really expensive. You remember how it was? To call to the country
And now it's cheaper, right?
And why is it so cheap? Because of the technology.
and I had to be very careful and have the clock right in front of me, no?
yes, I've had, the truth is that, I hope that technology keeps advancing, I would say that in ten years time, what else will they come up with, no?
Because all that must keep on advancing, no?
do you get me?
they have to find cures for like cancer, if you can go to the moon, why can't they find a cure for cancer? I'm sure they can, if they can make
a super fast computer that can think, why can't they find a cure for cancer?
It's  true, because how long has cancer been around?
yes, and how many people it kills, ¿right?
and they can't find a cure for it, ¿right?, and they cand find it, ¿right?
¿Right?, and that shortens life for a lot of people.
¿Have you heard about a discovery of cancer?
I wish, no? I wish that something comes out, that that God enlightens us, so that when they find something that can eh, heal, for this catastrophe that is when cancer comes, it doesn't matter at what age, but it comes, no?
Oh my God, in three days? Oh.
