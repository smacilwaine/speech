Hows it going hey this is Guillermo How are you . 
Oh Guillermo . 
Yes . 
Oh this is José . 
Hows it going where are you from . 
Oh butI live here in Philadelphia . 
In Philadelphia . 
Yes yes and you . 
I I am peruvian Eh I am studying in the University of Pennsylvania . 
Oh what do you study . 
Eh I study history . 
Oh I am also a student here Im eh senior . 
What university . 
From University of Pennsylvania too . 
Oh yes . 
Yes yes Okay I almost finish here . 
Oh thats good . 
But but . 
And you are studying is that you . 
So Im in Wharton . 
Hm . 
Then if its business but then you are a student for a PHD the Masters is that exactly . 
Is that no undergraduate . 
Ah Im an undergraduate ah okay okay . 
Hm mm Hm mm hm mm . 
Ah but these hours here . 
Sorry . 
But then did you live in Peru . 
I Im sorry as you say . 
Did you live in Peru . 
That is I was living in Peru until three months ago . 
Ah . 
Clearly . 
Then youre a freshman . 
No what happened what I studied at the University of Peru for two years and then I transferred that is Im an international transfer . 
Ah Ah okay So youre not an exchange student youre a transfer . 
It is clear eh eh I will graduate with a degree from this university . 
Ah Ah thats good . 
As op as opposed to an exchange student for example doesnt . 
Ah thats good And what do you think so far . 
Eh its a bit hard to tell you the truth . 
Yes is it of English or is it . 
And n well English English in fact is a lets say . 
All all the work . 
Its a difficulty I mean eh eh y have have studied English  ,  a larger part of my life  ,  but anyways its more difficult to express myself in English than express myself in Spanish . 
Yes yes . 
No I mean that is eh very clear for me . 
Yes . 
Eh but apart from that yes because of the amount of work that they that they send me also its a . 
More than in Peru . 
I yes I think so they send you more . 
Mm . 
More more than in Peru Even in the last cycle  ,  I in  ,  in in Peru eh in my university I took six classes Eh one semester . 
Hm mm . 
And and even like that I think that I had less work than what Im having now taking five classes . 
Mm . 
But well what happens is that Im taking five classes but I also work . 
Ah okay okay . 
I dont know maybe thats equivalent to taking six classes or something like that . 
Yes yes . 
Maybe its its a little less I dont think its so demanding as taking six classes . 
Yes but its still pretty intensive . 
I think so yes maybe in the future I decide to . 
Yes its hard . 
I Ill decide to take less classes I dont know How many courses do you take per cycle more or less . 
Uhm it depends In general five but ah sometimes I think its just four last cycle I only took four but now Im taking five . 
Yeah and and you . 
But in general people in College only take four . 
I see . 
I think but in Wharton people generally take five . 
I see And do you work or . 
Eh . 
Or are you a full time student . 
I do have I have a little job at the library  ,  its Work Study  ,  but uh its not really a job because when Im there . 
I study so its not like that . 
Ah its very advantageous What what do you do in I also work in the library but Im a shelver . 
Hmm . 
So really it doesnt give me the chance to study . 
Ah I did that sometimes but no but in what are you doing What part of the library In . 
In the fifth floor of Van Pelt . 
Mm okay okay . 
Where do you work . 
In Lippincott . 
Wheres that . 
Its its the library at Wharton . 
Yea . 
Yes its on the second floor Mm no but yes  ,  its there its a good job  ,  because I work alone  ,  and I dont work too many hours just five hours a week sometimes I work ten hours a week but . 
Thats how it is I do my homework really so its not  .  So well there are there are times there are yea  ,  but for the end theres only a little bit more than a month of work left because . 
Theres more people who need help and everyone . 
Hm mm . 
Is doing their research and but in general its pretty no I dont have a lot of work . 
Hm mm . 
But yes here its eh but what Ive seen is that for example  ,  sometimes I from uh in Latin America but you saw that in Europe . 
In the universities they give you uh well in general theres  ,  not a lot of work just until the end really so the professors . 
Ah in in in England for example . 
Uh yea in Europe in general really . 
Yes Ive heard that too that I mean the amount of for example  ,  of the the the number of hours that you have in class each week . 
Hm mm . 
They are less than three . 
Hm mm . 
Then you have a lot of free time Doesnt have much class . 
Yes yes yes . 
And aside I think that yes well they dont give you much work no no Im not sure no no . 
Yes well well well them well no no they dont give them much work  .  But in general they want that we well it is supposed true that one is . 
Yes that one reads all that they are doing exercises and that they continue doing all that true . 
Of course Hm mm hm mm . 
I understand all the truth And then in the end they give an exam and that is the grade But here in the United States its . 
Different true Because here especially in history one has to investigate and then an essay and then another and another exam and . 
Hm mm . 
That is the best in the sense that one okay that there are less risks but ay . 
Yes ofcourse that that that definitely that is an advantage no truth that there are less risks . 
The traba yes yes but . 
Because really imagine that for example you go to a a a a a decide  ,  your exam grade  ,  All of a sudden the night before you couldnt sleep o . 
Whichever may have happened and all of a sudden . 
Yes . 
In the exam you dont all of a sudden you may have prepared a lot  ,  but for X reason it didnt go well in the exam then . 
Yes . 
I mean lets say your grade . 
Yeah . 
I mean your your grade goes down i dont know . 
Yeah yeah no but theres also all the work they give you  ,  i mean yeah every week you have one thing and another . 
Other job another job so . 
Yeah yeah yeah . 
Every system has its advantages But and in Peru Â¿hows it like in general . 
Lets see i mean i would say they also make us work  .  I mean we dont we have like an equivalent to midterms . 
Uh um . 
But theyre mostly reading controls . 
Uh um . 
Uh through all i mean spread lets say through the semester . 
Uh um . 
And for some courses not all of them youre also asked to at the end of the course to deliver an essay A research paper . 
Uh um . 
And also you also have a final exam But lets say you dont have to produce as much as you do here . 
Uh um . 
I mean you dont have to write much . 
Uh um right . 
Here theyre like constantly making you writing papers and reviews Â¿right . 
Yes . 
There not so much I mean there instead what you had to write for example  ,  you wrote it in the exam or to give in that is in the investigation . 
Hmm mm . 
In the final semester But aside all of that no you didnt have to produce much . 
Yes yes . 
And well I mean that could be seen as advantageous in the sense that you dont have they dont ask you much I mean . 
One can live more relaxed . 
Yes yes . 
But the point is the disadvantage is that you dont come  .  You dont get to practice your your no you are not in a constant practice of labor of . 
Investigation and neither about how to describe right I mean  ,  sometimes one for not writing much one loses ease right write So . 
Hm mm hmm mm . 
I would tell you that I mean its more its easier right I mean . 
Yes Hmm mm hm mm . 
Its easier but I dont know if it is say if they form it so well like they form it here . 
Yes yes . 
But it has a cost that your form that is the cost is that here they make form you better its good  ,  but at least me  ,  for example  ,  this final weekend I am full of things to do so . 
You live a little moreuh at least I live a little more anxious say a little more . 
Yes . 
Stressed . 
Yes yes . 
But I dont know how Wharton might be I dont know . 
Yes well it is it is it is different because in Wharton  .  Well it also depends well It depends because for example I say classes I take in general dont have . 
Like essays or research only in general two three exams and and thats it  .  But there are classes for example that have more like that  ?  well you have the two exams but you also have projects . 
OK . 
These like case studies . 
And are the personal or group products . 
In groups in general those days almost everything is in groups  .  And of course if they give you homework things little things like that for one to be reviewing because otherwise . 
Because and and and I like it like that for example  ,  every week you have homework a small one you have to turn in because that way . 
One has they make you study every week truly . 
Of course . 
But yes that that that I like sometimes they do that but in general they are exams or projects But in . 
Hm mm . 
Each class always has an exam I dont I have never had a class where there were only projects true but in general two exams and maybe one project . 
Hm mm hm mm . 
In the then now in the Marketing class we have a a project that is like a e  ,  and I dont know how they did it eh eh and . 
They created a whole piece of software that is like a simulation and then one  ,  for example  ,  each request well there are like five orders or six orders then . 
You have a group . 
Hm mm . 
And then everyone each group is assigned a company . 
Hm mm . 
Then one have several products this company has several products  ,  then you have to decide based on each productwell where are we going what kind of . 
How are we going to sell this product we are going to . 
Ah that is interesting . 
Place more if if is is like one one is in a of course is not like in the real life but . 
But well it resembles at least in some . 
It helps if if is not is not interesting but then then when that ends you have to write some like that essays to make an analysis . 
Of what you made of the the mistakes of what you did well . 
Hm Hm . 
Then there are many things like that too Then everything everything depends on the coursebut . 
Hm Hm . 
Eh yes yes here there is and I hardly write anything in general Then it looked pretty weird that I had to write . 
Yeah . 
But em and what else and now ant time here surely you donÂ´t like it right . 
How come . 
Too much cold here right . 
Well yes yes yes yes I think it was on Tuesday at night that was raining . 
Yes . 
I got frozen yes well I have to go with my coat  .  I mean with my I have is I bought a coat that shelters a lot . 
Not yes . 
And I have for well I always go out with it  ,  But still sometimes even using the coat I get cold too But well inside my room it is more . 
Hm . 
M manageable the matter of of the d inside the dorm yea yea the temperature is is its I its good enough . 
Pe . 
Warm right . 
But in Peru Ive heard there are parts where it really gets cold . 
Well right yea yes if you go to the mountains . 
Hm mm . 
Also at nighttime more than anything well if you go to the mountains in the wintertime in in winter  ,  uh the winter nights in the mountains are really cold yea . 
Hm yea I see . 
Id say even the I mean I remember once I must have gone to the mountains in Peru and its something on vacation with my family and yea at night . 
It could get even get colder than the cold Ive experienced here . 
Hello . 
Hello my name is Glori . 
Hello Gloria I am Paulina Where are you calling from . 
From New York . 
New York I am in Georgia . 
From Long Island . 
Ah . 
From Long Island . 
Long Island . 
Aha . 
I am in Athens Georgia . 
Oh from Georgia on my God . 
Mm How is it . 
I didnt understand what she said . 
What . 
Something about religion She said she talks . 
You didnt understand what she said . 
No . 
She was talking about the religion what is the opinion about religion if it unifies people or separate them  ,  all the people should belong to the same religion or whatever . 
Ah okay Um I am catholic So I believe I believe um it joins some and separate others For example I have a nephew that is gay . 
So they are Catholics they dont accept gay people . 
Aha . 
Because they say that God didnt make them that way  .  So I remember when my nephew was born we know wee knew that he was going to be one . 
People never believe that they are born that way but he was  ,  And if you have someone in your family you know So he . 
Has a lot of problems with the Catholic religion because they dont accept him and he knows hes  ,  not accepted  .  So he finally found a church in the thirtytwo in New York that accepts homosexuals . 
I see Well I think that if people would stick to their religion  ,  there wouldnt be that many problems they wouldnt go to extremes every religion . 
Mhm Aha . 
If people would follow for example what Jesus Christ said  ,  if they would follow His teachings if they would act like He did . 
Mhm . 
There wouldnt be a problem . 
Aha . 
But when they start fighting thats not what He taught us . 
Mhm . 
Jesus Christ . 
Exactly . 
Thats when trouble arises . 
Mhm . 
The same thing happens to Muslims . 
Mhm . 
Or the Jews the principles of that religions teach us to . 
Mmh . 
In itself it is they are good things But when people become fanatic and dont accept other people you respect differences . 
Aha Aha . 
I believe that there is when there is division problems . 
Yes yes yes Lie this what was I going to say I at lunch time I to the girls where I work where I work three . 
I take this a little book by Joyce Myers and he an everyday scriptures And I read them  ,  then they tell me ah that is shit that I say but . 
Listen what she is saying listen that you treat your neighbor  ?  well like you you would like to treat you Ah no I dont have to treat her well . 
I dont like her I say but everybody is created in the image of God  .  Ay we start to fight Then I say Look I want peace because what happens is that everything and I not to . 
We talk about about about todays subject But forget it one has been made but still they look for me To to read everyday . 
How great . 
Because there is one that is like a firecracker and I was telling her that I dont want to hang out with her because she drains . 
All my energy And she is always criticizing everyone and I dont want : I dont want to be in this environment  .  She says yes I read to her everyday the other days she is saying . 
Write down five things you are thankful to God for eh  ,  am who do you think you are forget  ,  it  .  She always ay you are always reading something about religion that . 
I say that is the only thing that has saved my mind because otherwise if I start to criticize that everybody criticizes me  ,  and I know that I am a good person and that God just like I am . 
If I let people influence me I would have already jumped out of a window . 
Yes . 
And that is what happens to her she is criticized  ,  then she  ,  I say  ,  look  ,  God loves you  ,  and like you  ,  are but you have to you can not be criticizing everyone . 
And it is true the same as when the . 
Yes . 
In one on one relationships or like the religi like a people like lets say what what happens in Israel amongst the . 
Uh huh . 
Between the Palestinians and the . 
Yes Uh huh . 
And the Jews . 
Uh huh . 
Its sad and they go fighting . 
Yes yes yes yes yes yes . 
Because for the two there are sacred places but they dont respect . 
Uh huh uh huh . 
Other people . 
Its that its that the eh eh precisely the Catholic religion  ,  the whole world is going like m my friend she went to another church She tells me . 
This this and this and the other and I say you have to find the church where you want that you believe that you fits you . 
Or that in Im not going to tell you that you should go to the Catholic church if its not giving you anything because I go to Catholic church . 
So then she she found another church she tells me  ,  maybe you should go with me  ,  I say  ,  no leave me to me to where I am going I am more agreeable where I am . 
And you know I am going to charismatic groups so then n n  ,  I like to go to other churches  ,  Im  ,  not going to say that I dont go but I dont want that she co me . 
Now I have been to that church now I have been back many times And and it takes all day  ,  Sunday  ,  and I dont have the whole day on Sunday to be there . 
Three hours four hours . 
Ah yes . 
Uh huh . 
What religion goes is your friend . 
I believe its something like Christian Science . 
Oh . 
Yes yes yes They are like born again Christians or something like that . 
Yeah . 
Yes something like that So then you know she was Catholic  ,  But the husband goes to the Catholic Church  ,  In my house  ,  the only one going to church is me  ,  I dont think she likes to go she always fights with me when she goes . 
And he does not believe that God is helping him  .  So I everyday I tell him you see God gave you that since today we were talking about . 
Of Katrina and he says ay God made that which . 
Mhm . 
I could not convince him that it was not God that it was an act  .  You know an act of God as they say but it was not . 
God himself He does not allow them even though the Bible said that a lot of those things would occur  .  So I was telling him to maybe read the Bible it will show you what there is . 
Mhm Yes . 
Mhm . 
Thats the way it is I find that regarding religion many people go solely by tradition and . 
Aha yes . 
When one goes and finds the the truth . 
Aha . 
And really finds there one finds a religion that . 
Aha aha Yeah . 
They like But many people who also go solely by religion but do not even know what their own religion is about . 
Exactly They sit there and once the Father is finished they leave they run . 
Yes or they dont study whats written for themselves or anything . 
Yes . 
Yes Help when we start studying who would believe its your own religion . 
Ityes yes Like ultimately I am going to a charismatic group  .  Then I am understanding more even though they speak in Spanish  ,  and I dont understand I can speak Spanish but I cant read or write it . 
So then they gave me a Hispanic bible and I forget it  ,  I am reading it  .  But i dont know Then I go and explain to them that I read this and this and this . 
That is what then they read in English to see if I can understand it But its much too difficult the bible is is . 
The bible yes the bible is difficult The vocabulary that it uses even though it doesnt matter what language I find . 
Eexactly exactly So I find it very difficult so I they give me some some passages and I read them and then they tell me this is this and this is this and this is this . 
You know and I begin to use it like in our lives And I say Oh okay Then I understand . 
Mm From where are you from . 
I am Puerto Rican . 
Puerto Rican But were you born in the United States . 
Yes Yes yes yes I was born in Puerto Rico  ,  but I grew up in New York in what they call el barrio In East what they cal el barrio in Manhattan .

All my neighbors do have permission to keep animals but I dont really like to have them here locked up all day long . 
Uh uh . 
Yes do you have animals . 
Yes I have dos I have a cat . 
Oh . 
I have some plants outside the house and I have an aquarium . 
Oh . 
I have lots of things to have fun . 
Exactly My husband and I would like to have a dog  .  The thing is that here we dont since we live in an apartment we dont have . 
The yes . 
A garden or anything . 
But you can take them out for a walk I used to live in an apartment  .  I moved here abut six no five months ago and Ive been here for three months with the dog the cat the plant . 
And the aquarium I used to take my dog out for a walk outside . 
Yes the thing is that we want to have one but it will have to be a puppy . 
Yes its the . 
Yes if we are going to be here all day  ,  long and not just in the evenings We really dont want to leave the poor puppy locked up in the apartment all day long . 
Ah . 
This is the question But we are thinking of moving to this . 
Ah yea Your husband is from here the Unitated States Or from Venezuela . 
No hes from the United States . 
Ah yea Few that are going to change soon . 
If we are waiting to buy a house close from here to begin to . 
To move . 
If so we can move and thus be able to find a puppy or anything else . 
For this and not feel like we moved out one month ago recently To me this is my home from where Im talking . 
And we had to close the yard and place cartons all around to have the hill just outside it is so small and the dog is a labrador . 
Exactly . 
Then it can enter and leave the garage but it has the gate opened and has a space where it can walk run and play . 
Yes I want it If it can enter and leave freely it can play in the yard and that . 
And has . 
Runs all around exercising . 
And you have another ideea Like what kind of puppy do you want . 
Yes if you are thinking of a reason why . 
Ah its very little . 
Not like the medium ones . 
Which are . 
But I know that they look like teddies . 
Ah yes yes I know which they are They are pretty and they are colored .

Ahh . 
Eh aeh its not much I have liked much I was do is find music online . 
Okay . 
So what that almost all the music I have I have around five hundred CDs that I have bought and . 
Ahh . 
A lot of them I have looked for online . 
Exactly . 
So what that that for me well its for me  ,  I I need music for everything I need it for when I work when I study . 
Eh I always like to have music its what keeps me alert  .  I suppose uhh mmm so what for me music yes is extremely important . 
And its substantive eh . 
Exa . 
It helps me to concentrate it helps me to rela to relax ehm  .  I find music for me can help me change my mood yes ca I can be . 
Exac . 
Very calm and yes I listen to a song that can put me in a bad mood or the same  ,  I could be in a bad mood and can listen to a song that makes me happy . 
Exactly exactly no yes I also I because me no ehm  ,  I play  ,  I play my instrument and my husband plays his instrument and at least oh maybe one that is festivals and things like that . 
Okay . 
There is a bar that is very close to my house where many people come to play every night nothing people seit no to and to play instrument . 
And there are open circles every night and there are songs of where the people pay and then on the weekends they come here different musical groups . 
To play every night from on on the weekends and it is very cool . 
Okay Ehm what is your favorite type of music . 
I like everything . 
Is there any type of music that you dont like . 
I like at least ehm that I dont like that way at least that if rap hip hop or at least music oh pop . 
So that if Britney Spears and not that I dont like it it doesnt strike my attention at all . 
Okay . 
I like oh I like a lot oh ehm at least rock in Spanish  .  I have a lot of rock in Spanish and bluegrass music So . 
Okay And what do you have a favorite group . 
Well I like at least from rock in Spanish I like Fito Paez a lot . 
Okay . 
That is from Argentina . 
Yes . 
Yes I like it a lot . 
Okay . 
And from the American music there is a mister that we call it thats very good . 
That . 
And the one who died ah him too was a very good singer  ,  but more or less where I live there are many people who play . 
Oh . 
Many of our friends that play and sing and have bands . 
Yes . 
And all of the groups that they have are they are very very good too . 
Okay well for me I only go to one or two concerts each year . 
 . 
< poorly written phrase > . 
But in general the type of concert Im going to is more like rock in english and the people that go are more . 
Younger and and as it is they are too scandalous  ,  So for that I didnt pay too much attention to going to concerts for that . 
 . 
< this phrase barely even made sense > . 
Ah . 
Well at least this year I was at a concert of Willy Nelson . 
Aha . 
And Bob Dylan . 
Yes . 
And it had people of every age there were people that were sixty or seventy years  ,  old and kids that were barely ten or eight years old in the concert . 
Yes . 
Yes good very cool It was held in a small stadium in a small baseball standium and there werent so many people there because of that . 
Was very very good concert . 
You buy music or have many CDs . 
Of course We buy music more than anything but also we bought a lot of music from groups that are not very popular of people we know . 
Yeah . 
Yes because we are members of one of folk music societies of Philadelphia then at least there are many musicians . 
Who are members and there are concerts in the homes and they do this every month . 
Ok . 
There was a concert in in a house of a member and we bought all those CDs . 
Ok . 
We see groups that are not so super super famous but they are good . 
Ok . 
And sometimes we have we have seen groups . 
And . 
That did not know they were famous and suddenly were hearing being in a festival or something similar . 
Yeah . 
And suddenly we hear a song it is famous . 
Ok . 
But . 
So you say you play instruments you and your husband play in a band or group . 
No no no My husband played in a group before They are not together in that group probable they will be together again . 
Okay . 
But no we dont play for a group my husband sometimes plays with his friends but we dont really have time . 
To to compromise ourselves with other people . 
Okay . 
Because of the job and that doesnt well it doesnt give us time to compromise ourselves that way with a group because if you have a group you have to practice for at least one day . 
Practice and find that . 
Week . 
The promotions and . 
Okay . 
Yeah . 
So if you have to dedicate too much time you can get a group theres a group that wants to play with my husband . 
But where do they get together they get together on Wednesdays at night around ten and they practice until like 2 in the morning . 
Does he work or study how does he have time for that . 
Yeah um ya yo i would have loved to learned how to play an instrument but Im horrible at that stuff . 
Music i like music its good for me its necessary for me i like it . 
I i remember songs lots of songs from . 
Mm . 
Songs that i can let years pass by without listening anything else  .  I could keep sining those kind of songs years after years . 
That happens to me But whenever i dont listen to a song for a long time  .  I forget the lyrics but the other day i was talking to a friend . 
And she was with her we listened to a song on the radio that i didnt hear in about eight years but she remembered the entire song . 
And afterwards they played a song that I hadnt listened to  .  And it was some four years that I hadnt listened to it and I knew the song . 
I knew that I knew the song but I couldnt remember the words to the song  ,  but I remembered a little not much To me if I forget or not if not . 
If I dont listen all the time I forget the words  ,  I know the song but I forget the words a little . 
Ah well to me for me its that it depends on the mood Im in I go for it so that its . 
But I eh I have an Ipod You know what Ipods are . 
Uhhuh . 
Eh for me then eh I have like ten thousand songs in the Ipod . 
Uhhuh . 
So I have in all I have a list of music that only has music for the the dance music . 
I have a complete list that is only rock in eh English  .  That is basically what I use when I go to the gym . 
Exactly . 
I have a list that is music only in Spanish and a list that is only classical music opera things like that . 
For relaxation . 
Ah and for studying . 
Eh I have eh a list well to the contrary For me eh to study  .  I cant have that type of music I cant have classical music I need music . 
Yes . 
That have lyrics because if donÂ´t if there are not lyrics I get bored I need something to distract me . 
What are you studying . 
Eh Eh I work with virus . 
Okay . 
In biology . 
Okay . 
So I always need something that distract me that keeps me alert . 
Exactly . 
Yes yes yes I put music but not classic . 
Hmm . 
I get sleep I put classic music when I have many times to write a a report when I have to concentrate a lot a lot a lot . 
Then even since I was a little kid always when I had to study  ,  I always was hearing to music while singing I could be reading and my dad always criticized that . 
Is impossible for a person to read and sing at the same time  ,  but I donÂ´t know it always worked with me I always got good grades so . 
I suppose that . 
I had a teacher . 
Not . 
That said that when you are not studying something like you have to have to learn it that if you sing it you will learn it you learn it even . 
Faster than the normal . 
Yes that doesnÂ´t doesnÂ´t attracts me a little the music whatever eh can . 
Hi hello . 
Hello you are speaking with Fabiola . 
And they connect you and therefore was working . 
Yeah and thats how it was working and they and they pay you therefore . 
Oh look that also . 
Cool or not and and that is the topic that that i tell you to chat and and from so a issue of conversation . 
So lets talk about memories . 
About the best thing that has happened in your life . 
Ah . 
And how has your life changed . 
Okay . 
And whats the best thing that has happened to you in your life . 
Ahh a lot of things . 
But the best thing that you feel has happened in your life . 
Ahh . 
Thats a good topic . 
Yes i meet somebody with this kids . 
Yes . 
I think everything begins knowing someone because if not had known him no . 
Yes i say the same . 
These kids must have not been here . 
Ahh the best thing that has happened to me was meeting my husband . 
Yes because how . 
And the second and other best thing that has happened to me was having my kids . 
Yes . 
Be healthy and staying healthy . 
For yes because if not if i had not meet the boy I wouldnt be here . 
And in reality . 
Another wouldnt have these kids nope I wouldnt have known you either . 
Yes . 
If it had not been for . 
Why not its good the thing of the good topics  ,  well  ,  that you find good conversation topics when you talk over here  ,  because they too also put the music yesterday there was the music . 
Yes . 
Ah yes and it is entertaining you talk for twelve minutes and they themselves cut you off . 
Well here me I like them . 
Yes they tell you that you have thirty seconds to say goodbye . 
Ohhh . 
And even though we have twelve minutes to talk about what we want because they are starting to recognize our voices . 
But uh what is this called there is no need to talk about what they say . 
We need to talk we need to talk about what they say or what ever you want the idea is to talk because that is everything the entire conversation is recorded . 
Ah so that after the computer knows that hu . 
Who is who . 
And for him for the accent . 
Because the accent the system its the form of speaking and . 
Mm . 
The stamps I have and they are inventing something . 
Yes for the . 
Then they need people that have different voices . 
Ahh no idea and I hadnt called because I would say no no you cant call . 
And the . 
Much earlier . 
Yes the girls all connect using this number . 
Yes . 
Yes they call each other at once at the same time . 
Ahhh . 
And and they connect well they connect well . 
Im going going to try then to call after a little later or in the middle of the day perhaps i dont know . 
Yes but I dont know if you can make two calls at the same time . 
In the same day . 
Ahh that I dont know I can hear the voices of the beautiful kids . 
Yes i hear them theyre here they are . 
I can hear it very clear yeah . 
They are both laughing . 
They are and what are you doing for them to laugh . 
They are are sitting on my laps and ones in front of the other and the look at each other and laugh . 
They look and laugh and say you look like me nono you look like me . 
And one has a lollipop so he throws that lollipop onto him while they are there . 
They are interesting ohh they are growing do you talk to them . 
Oh . 
Do you talk to them now . 
How . 
Do you talk to them do you talk to your kids . 
Yes i talk to them i talk to them when theres time and i talk to them when . 
In english . 
In Spanish . 
Ohh . 
And in english . 
In english thats good because they are going to know to different languages . 
Yeah because thats how they grow up with two languages . 
Yes . 
Because yes and besides they also grow with not having an accent . 
Imagine me with Geni with two languages also she speaks both languages  .  She can read both languages but nevertheless she has an accent and has trouble with Spanish . 
Eh . 
And since being little and she had the first three years she was born here . 
Mm . 
But when she was two and a half months old I took her to Chile and in Chile the same . 
And where did she learn how to talk she learned to talk when she was in Chile yes well . 
Is that she only learned just words she couldnt say complete phrases because . 
Ah . 
We used to come here on vacation every year and one month here . 
Ah . 
And her father always spoke English to her . 
Ah so she was like confused . 
And of course and so when she would hear him she would hear a very bad Spanish from Michel . 
Mm . 
Or a bad English from me . 
Ah . 
Now I speak better English Michel speaks better Spanish and she can read both languages and shes better but yes she gets confused when her dad . 
Speaks with an accent and a strong accent . 
The bad thing that Im doing I mean I speak in Spanish  .  But the bad thing is that for example when Im with another person and they speak English . 
I speak to them in English understood . 
But isnt that bad . 
Because it is not but it is bad the same because it is not because my accent is not it is not understanda . 
It is not good no . 
And I know that they are very little now they are not going to are not going to  ,  but that oh the same all of this is being engraved since . 
Yes from the time they are four months old children begin to . 
Is that . 
And do you have planned what you are going to do for Christmas or for thanksgiving day . 
For the day of thanks we are going to go with my with Armis grandparents comes back something to eat because my .

So i think i would put that one for her because i think thats what she wants . 
And for her birthday what did you give her . 
And a karoke . 
A karoke and do you play with it or not . 
Yes it sings it is good because at her age  .  She is readings as she reads the letters and they get darker change color . 
M . 
Then she sings the song . 
Ahh . 
And yes it keeps her entertained and it is very good for her to read faster that is super great for christmas and my father inlaw .

Hi . 
Hi . 
Â¿Whos this . 
My name is Annie . 
Hi Annie Im Arturo . 
Hi Arturo . 
Â¿Where are you calling from . 
Miami . 
From Miami very good Im calling from . 
Â¿from where . 
Philadelphia . 
Philadelphia . 
Yeah Â¿where are you from . 
Uh Puerto Rican . 
Oh OK . 
Â¿And you . 
Im Mexican . 
Oh . 
Yes . 
Â¿Are you studying here in the United States . 
Yes exactly . 
Thats good . 
Â¿do you study or work . 
No uh i have a twentythree months old daughter and i have a four days old son now . 
Oh hey thats cute . 
So no Im working but no . 
Yes well of course . 
Not outside of home . 
Yes of course a lot of work at home i imagine . 
Yes . 
Thats good but very happy i imagine right . 
Yes a little tired now but very happy . 
Yes your son is four days . 
Four days . 
Wow a little . 
Yes . 
So young hey and uh then Â¿why do you live in the United States Â¿have you lived there your whole life or . 
Yes uh my parents are from Dominican Republic . 
Okay . 
And in the nineteen seventy something i dont know exactly when it was . 
Mh mhm . 
Ah I believe it was sixtythree I am not sure . 
Mhm . 
But a revolution in Santo Domingo . 
OK . 
And they went to live to Puerto Rico . 
Ah OK . 
Then they went to live twentyish years there . 
Aha . 
Then from there my sister when she went to college came here to the state of Florida then we moved to Miami . 
Ah OK . 
And I had like I think I was five years old . 
Ah very small . 
Yes my sister is ten eleven years older . 
Ah OK . 
Then from there we you know we stayed and . 
Yes . 
Eh I I went to school here and you know we made a life here . 
Yes yes of course . 
And . 
And now are you married with is it with a Latino or an American . 
An American . 
Ah OK I see . 
Yes I met him at University . 
Ah OK this from here in in Miami I suppose . 
No eh I went to . 
Ah OK . 
In . 
OK . 
Then I met him there . 
Ah I see very good . 
Then . 
And . 
After ah . 
And what what language do you speak with with this with your  ?  well it is that now you dont want to talk yet your children true because . 
Well . 
He is twentyfour months the other no . 
Eh she she is twentythree months and the other is four days old . 
Twenty three yes well no it is . 
I what we do here that when he is not here in my husband is not at home . 
Mm . 
I speak completely in Spanish to my daughter . 
Okay . 
So then when hes here we speak completely in English . 
Ah okay . 
And like that she can know both languages . 
Recognize them . 
And and I get surprised because many times she says things . 
Oh yes . 
That I hadnt even realized she had already learned . 
Oh really . 
It could be in English or in Spanish . 
Wow aha . 
So shes already learning . 
Very fast . 
Yes . 
Also I mean like at what age do kids start talking normally I really dont know . 
And mm I think it was she was lets say fifteen sixteen months . 
Okay . 
Since shes learning English and Spanish . 
Aha . 
Hey you take the kids that take a little more time to talk . 
Yes yes . 
So I picked up my little girl you know and her friends or whatever her little friends . 
Yes . 
Eh she needs to speak louder than she is . 
Yes . 
Ah until recently . 
Ah . 
So I knew that she could understand it and could speak . 
Yes but . 
But he had to learn the language that was a little more difficult . 
Of course it is much more difficult but I believe it will be good in the long run  ,  but not very good so far with the language is an advantage . 
Yes yes . 
The truth . 
So eh but you know it I know that she understood . 
Mm . 
What I was saying in English and Spanish . 
Yes yes I imagine . 
Now you know I know that she understands me because when she doesnt know how to do something it makes her feel dumb I know . 
Yes . 
I see her little face and I know she understands me exactly . 
Yes of course but children are very clever and then no . 
Yes yes . 
You know . 
So you know she understands it she speaks it . 
Hmm . 
And . 
Well I hope she stays like that because then when shes growing  ,  and a lot of her friends speak English shes going to practice English more I think . 
Yes and uh were not going to send her to school were going to homeschool her . 
Ah okay . 
Because I am was a teacher . 
Ah . 
Then I think that instead of going and teaching you know someone elses kids I should stay home . 
Yeah . 
And I can teach my own children . 
Yes thats true . 
So . 
But what do you think about her not having school mates . 
Well . 
Thats also not an experience bone . 
Yes there are many programs here in Miami for people who teach their children at home . 
Aha . 
Then usually once a week they will be together . 
Ah okay . 
Then its like school they have a class that theyll have to teach in English or at the University whatever but as a school that meets once a week . 
Ah okay . 
So and also you know with friends and stuff I have many friends and family who have done that . 
The . 
Mhm and I dont have any problems . 
Ah okay . 
Known but also not something that . 
Yes . 
Because to me that worries me too I want her to have lots of friends and all that . 
Yes of course thats what I was thinking thats part of the experience no to be in school with people you know . 
Yes yes . 
So I think that too its important you dont need that when youre a kid because to have true friends is very important . 
Yes yes . 
I dont think so . 
Yes yes . 
But yes as long as she has contact with other people for at least once a week only . 
And also you know they have the sports of in other words the places in the community . 
Yes there are many is that here theres a lot of contribution from the community right and that . 
Yes so you know thing like that is how they How do you say it they socialize . 
Yes I see . 
So you know . 
Yes yes yes since in Mexico thats not common you understand it doesnt happen at all . 
Yes . 
So I dont know anyone who has come out from that type of school  ,  you understand and Ive always been very curious about how they do it here in the United States  ,  because here I do know is much more common there are a lot of people that . 
That come from home schooling Oh well at least before now I dont know . 
Yes is you know is like any other experience is how you take it  .  You know it can be good or it can be bad . 
Yes yes yes yes . 
But I also think how the schools are here also how the kids are . 
It can be very bad also right . 
Yes that also I would like for her to have friends and all those things  .  But at the same time I think I have to protect her . 
Yes of course but you have to be careful because then again is bad to over protect them . 
Yes yes . 
It can be very bad . 
Yes but for that reason is that I want to teach her because I can teach her anything but it depends how I present it to her . 
Yes . 
You know . 
Yes yes . 
Its a little different than lets say what they show you in school . 
Yes thats true And until what grade do you think to home school her . 
I dont know I havent given it much thought since shes only two years old . 
Yes . 
And I havent started . 
In time well see . 
Yes so . 
But what do you think I mean are you planning to teach him the whole elementary grades . 
Ah it would probably be until at least sixth grade . 
Okay . 
Then from there well see because I dont know you know I I can teach her up to High School . 
Ah yes . 
Ah . 
So youve taught classes up to high school or what . 
Yes yes . 
Well and which subjects . 
Well I I was an special education teacher . 
Yeah . 
So I taught everything . 
Oh OK I see . 
So now you know the only thing is that if you dont agree I wont do it . 
Yep . 
If I dont understand the topic I teach it to myself and then I am able to teach it to the kids . 
Alright OK I see . 
So you know how are we going to say algebra . 
Nop . 
Its not that I dont know it but I could forget it . 
If . 
Because I dont use it . 
Yep . 
So um you know before I started the class I kind of remembered everything . 
Nop . 
What is it that I had to do . 
Yes off course . 
So I could teach them . 
Oh OK . 
SO for me that isnt so hard I know for someone else it could be but not for me . 
Yes but like i said in high school the subjects  ,  kind of get more specialized like chemistry is more advanced and physics is more advanced . 
Likely this time I know that now . 
Aha . 
They have classes for kids that can take and solve them on the computer . 
Yes . 
And they can go to high school let us say it on the internet . 
Yes . 
You know there are many many many options itÂ´s not only that . 
Yes yes yes . 
You know that one must . 
Yes no . 
To register the ( person ) in a public school . 
Mhm . 
Do you know I know that these Universities . 
Mhm . 
Have classes for kids too in high schools that can be taken in the University . 
Yes I heard about that . 
Therefore you know we have many options . 
Very good very good luck . 
And . 
But like you say it but heÂ´s barely two years old and right now thereÂ´s no need to think a lot about this . 
No but since my husband says you know that Im a teacher . 
Aha . 
Im always reading her books Im you know singing her songs . 
Mm . 
So that she you know shes having fun but at the same time shes learning something always . 
Yes okay . 
So you know Im not really giving her formal schooling . 
Okay . 
But I am giving oh Im teaching her . 
Mm . 
Little by little she already knows the alphabet Well she knows the song . 
Yes she reads . 
Yes aha so she already knows the numbers . 
Yes . 
A little you know if I tell her one she can tell me Two three  ,  then the next one she tells me  .  She already knows that eight comes after seven you know things like that . 
Yes she already knows the order . 
Yes not all but little by little . 
Yes Thats good . 
So you know like . 
Yes sounds sounds very interesting . 
Yes . 
I dont know anything I dont know I mean if I was in that situation  ,  I dont know how I would do it because I could never imagine how . 
I can give my son classes I couldnt because to tell you the truth  ,  Im  ,  not so I didnt have an education to be able to give classes you understand . 
Mm . 
I imagine you must have studied something like Education or something like that no . 
Well . 
What did you study . 
I studied yes education but they didnt exactly teach me how to teach a kid lets say how to teach a kid to read . 
Yes no . 
All those things I had to learn when I was working . 
Aha . 
So Im using the experience . 
Of course of course all that you acquired all the schools gave classes . 
Yes But for that reason is that you know I for me to do it with my son . 
Mm . 
Is not a problem because I already have the experience I dont know you know How other people do it . 
My name is Mariza . 
Hello good afternoon my name is Lorena I am here in San Antonio Texas . 
Hello . 
Hello eh well todays topic is very moving eh . 
Yes it has also been hard for me to think abut which one is better and which one is but . 
Exactly now I said well it is going to be memories  .  I said well memories are like precisely the most important thing that can happen in life because you live off of memories no . 
Exactly with so much eh with so and I dont know the more time goes by more memories  ,  there are i dont know I wouldnt know which one to choose to start with . 
Ah . 
For example the best . 
Thats how it is the best well I am a mom . 
Yes me too . 
And maybe yes yes I would like to think about the best that has happened to me  ,  maybe it is that to have had my children  .  I remember that at the moment in which I was having him  .  I said this is the best that has happened my whole life then I want . 
Of course . 
I want to be consistent lets say with this comment that I made to myself at the moment that something was happened but however there must be also other things . 
Wonderful and maybe you can not select just one really . 
Of course well that is what I was thinking that and also I asked that if that had not happened  ,  how your life would have been different In your case not having had your children . 
Yes yes yes well I wouldnt have liked it . 
It is it is . 
Because because now they are bigger they have given me  .  Well so many beautiful things that maybe by myself it wouldnt have been enough to get so many memories and so many . 
Eh positive and negative emotions then well well not everything is beautiful  .  No I have precisely well I have a son who who has some pro a health problem and that is also very painful no . 
Yes . 
And and well this but nevertheless emotions are more maybe more like love and more tender and more eh well and the husband is there right the husband . 
Yes and its that no yes yes but the children the children . 
That also has a lot a lot to do . 
Yes . 
In in ones life no and this . 
No . 
But yes I I would think that it cant be just one just one event . 
Sure . 
Now a painful event an painful memory the death of my mother for example . 
Sure yes the death of a family member or a loved one has to be the worst that can happen to someone . 
Yes yes yes or a sons illness also no that also . 
Also . 
Its very painful but as I say you cant eh  ,  say that only you but its nice to try to think about it no . 
Sure like the second part of my question it was that that that what would have been of your life if not if that had not happened that negative or painful event . 
Eh yes . 
I mean that it wouldnt be that person would be now still for example  ,  in my case  ,  my mom alive but my my grandparents both died a long time ago . 
And I didnt have the opportunity to say goodbye to them because I lived far away so that maybe the would be that that what would have been of the my life would have been different if not because of course they couldnt meet my husband or my daughter either . 
So then yes . 
Exactly exactly mhm . 
Sure life would be pretty different . 
Mhm your husband where did you meet him . 
Here in the United States almost by chance . 
Aha because you are from Spain . 
I yes Im from Spain . 
Aha yes . 
So I came here to study but I met him and I ended up staying and Ive been here for twelve years now . 
Aha . 
And I have a five year old girl I can tell you my life has changed sure because kids change parents lives  ,  but she is still very young and I still have some time . 
Yes yes sure aha . 
And so well nothing I know its different when kids are older they become more independent but I still have to go through that . 
Yes yes and theres so many things many phases . 
And sure . 
But oh well at this age is when kids are more loving . 
Yes yes everybody says that . 
Mhm its a very loving phase and well when they grow up  ,  they go out and do their own things  .  And for example thats nice too but you dont get that much love as you used to . 
Now mom well I had a good time and hey  .  Mom well mom this is more like a conversation like a different level . 
And they dont depend on you that much they are not that close . 
Yes . 
But its really nice it really is so to you  ,  what is the best thing that has happened to you your best memory . 
Well I believe that the same like you to to have children eh  .  Well I only have one and I dont believe that I dont know if Ill have more . 
Okay . 
Was not not I mean I dont believe I was ready to being mother  ,  maybe because it was a big change and oh the pregnancy was really hard and the oh . 
The we have raised her my husb my husband and I here both alone  ,  then it was a little bit difficult  ,  but also was of course to have a kid change your life  ,  then so it is the best that have happened to me I say . 
Until now . 
Yes . 
Eh It can be compare with anything thats what I say . 
Yes its true it is what I right now has been instant  .  I thought that like more have past well have some nice memories in life about the achievements that you had . 
Of course . 
So like a person in the sports in or in the academic life or in the work no . 
Of course and and why the the other questions was what could be different  .  If I have not lived that maybe have not being mother well my life would be very different . 
I had finished the studies too had . 
Right exactly . 
Of course got a more more important career or had travel more or met some other person but of course you never know you only can imagine . 
Exactly exactly and however you go accumulating . 
Yes but . 
Memories in Christmas pictures and in the high school festivals pictures and in the kids sports festivals pictures . 
Oh . 
It is like precisely putting together this life because it is like it was made of memories not . 
Exactly yes I have thousands and thousands of pictures all of them are of of my are all are of my daughter thats because the . 
Its easy to say what is most important eh because excluding that off course without that i dont know i traveled allot Ive met interesting people that you cant compare with . 
With the children i guess . 
Mhm yes because this is like like a whole and you dont study to become mother you dont study to become . 
No . 
The human being doesnt study how to love but finally the emotion is more profound and complete no . 
Yes like i was saying to my sister she doesnt have any children  ,  and i say to her until you become a mother you would not know how is like being a woman . 
Complete because they have like 20 years married but no they dont have any children  ,  and i dont think they will and then its difficult to explain . 
Its difficult to explain them . 
Its difficult to explain one like they say . 
But but one says that i had one because i wouldnt like to lose it . 
Yes a had him because i say i already had thirty years  .  And i said it was time to have one have one now or dont bother if we get to old because . 
Of course to raise a child you have to have a lot of patience and energy and lots . 
Lots of energy indeed . 
Of all yes my daughter requires a lot of patience and sacrifice . 
Aha . 
And . 
Yes actually for example she because shes very playful . 
Shes very active more like hyperactive not like me when i was a child  ,  i was lot more quiet and did all my fathers said she is a lot more . 
She is more like three sometimes is . 
Yes yes yes . 
I finish tired after all those days but well shes like that she is like that one has to accept their children the way they are . 
Thats how it is yeah yeah yes . 
And . 
And this now I understand a lot because they are that way and everything they permit to happen because they have a strong and active character no . 
Yes that is what I think or do I wait for her . 
I believe she will achieve many things . 
Yes yes if i compare her to my niece they are so different  .  I think that my daughter i dont know she has a much stronger character  ,  perhaps that will help her in the future to get ahead . 
Yes with with all the difficult things that will confront her the challenges . 
Clearly . 
No I have a daughter the youngest is a bit like that and on top of being really good in her studies she is also an excellent sportsperson . 
Yes exactly that is what we want we want my daughter to also practice a sport  ,  but we want to wait until shes  ,  a bit older  ,  because shes just five years old maybe shes much too young but . 
She has the body to become a sportsperson and perhaps that will help her develop more and . 
Perhaps her character could too . 
Yes . 
Like also guide no mhm . 
And and perhaps calm her . 
And that she can get tired . 
Yes yes I need this because sometimes we go to sleep before her we cant continue like this . 
Yes yes yes she needs to get tired what ridiculousness . 
I dont know they tell me that its the age . 
Where do you live . 
We are living in Philadelphia right now . 
Oh in Philadelphia I have my oldest daughter studying at the university of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia . 
Oh what a coincidence it is a good university . 
Yes yes yes it is then in Philadelphia . 
Yes yes here it is a city where many people come to study  ,  many young people  .  One of the most important ones that that is also another important things as well education . 
Eh and yeah . 
Yeah of course . 
Of course I would like for my daughter to go to the university as well but I am still many years away from that . 
Yes but of course she will do it What did you study . 
Me criminal justice well psychology but I did not finish the degree . 
Aha aha . 
Well after I was pregnant the girl we wanted to raise her at home  .  We did not want to take her to a day care because we felt that I dont know its the traditional form that I was raised that I was with my parents they took care of me . 
Mhm mhm . 
We did not want to leave her alone in a daycare alone . 
That is a good decision . 
Yes yes it is good eh . 
I support her I have to take a lot of vitamins to have the necessary energy . 
Yes while it is possible and now yeah yes yes yes and . 
And now you will see how quickly time passes yes I celebrated my youngest daughters fifteenth birthday yesterday . 
Wow . 
And now when when you look back you will have many more memories  ,  many more memories of what she did that will be yours because . 
They achieve great things thanks to the support that parents can give and from what is given what you are giving not like you are saying that you leave to one side . 
Maybe your thing is more personal your career your profession . 
Yes . 
Well my name is Claudia Ivette With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking . 
Hi my name is Juan . 
Oh its a pleasure Juan . 
The pleasure is all mine Where are you . 
Excuse me . 
Ah Where are you . 
Ah Im here in the state of Idaho . 
Yeah . 
In a place called Robert uh and where are you speaking from . 
Ah okay Im in Texas in San Antonio . 
Wow a little far away . 
Yeah Im right here . 
Yeah yeah well you see we got the subject of movies . 
No yes . 
Well I dont about the ratings I dont understand a lot  .  I know that there are movies that are PG thirteen PG . 
Yeah . 
And actually Ive seen some that have more swear words that are PG thir eh eh theyre like more violent and more . 
The PGs are more like that the PGs than the PG thirteens Ive noticed . 
Ah yes . 
Then I dont understand a lot of that . 
Well uh you know i dont ok i havent taken into consideration those those classifications . 
OK . 
I cant understand them very well . 
OK . 
I think they are uh a little bit complicated instead they should have a little bit more information about what they have . 
Yeah thats true . 
Ok but in general as i no longer have little children . 
Yes . 
Uh children well i dont worry too much . 
Yes . 
About those classifications however i worry because when we go to see a movie thats worthy thats interesting and not just any movie then the classification . 
Yes . 
Im not so interested in that as much as i am in the quality and the comments i hear about the movies right . 
Right . 
Thats it thats what Im interested about its i dont know  ,  if you do the same  ,  if you always go with go alone or if you go with someone . 
No Im married Ive been married for three years and i do have a kid hes 20 months old . 
Right . 
So hes just about to turn two years old and  ,  yes  ,  as a matter of fact Im concerned about that what we do well my husband more than anything . 
For example he if we watch a movie and we really love it we love it if its ~PG or ~PG 13 . 
Right . 
What we watch the most we dont really like neither him nor myself to watch adult movies or those that . 
Uhhuh . 
Up to PG13 . 
Oh yes . 
Those or at times one that is R but the truth is that I dont pay attention for example if there is a movie that we like . 
Yes . 
We buy it and we have for example sometimes it has nude scenes or something like that my husband grabs the movie and erases that part . 
Oh . 
And we do it mostly because for example there are times when neither my husband nor me are going to be there so then the children might grab the movie and could watch it . 
So for that my husband will record some commercial or other thing . 
Uhhuh . 
Then really they can watch the movie but they are not going to see well at the best it will be purely cars or action . 
Yes . 
But for example if you take away or erase the part that is a bit pornographic because you see that always even though its a good movie it always has to have some nudity . 
Yes . 
At times it has nothing to do with it but . 
There is always something . 
We have movies that are action or cars and suddenly up comes something that has nothing to do with that but . 
Yes it has nothing to do with it yes . 
So then that is what weve done because we are going to have other children and once in a while they will be alone  ,  and we dont have to worry that they are going to watch a movie then . 
There will be no problem but . 
Yes yes I believe that in that sense you might be right . 
Yes . 
Oh look that very curiously . 
Yeah . 
What worries me the most in the movies is language and the violence . 
Oh yes because it really . 
Generally because like you say when there is an exaggeration in language . 
Yes . 
Or in violence everything else is the same . 
Yes . 
So when the movie is like that R well obviously it will have scenes of all types . 
No yes . 
Those are free so then R appear more than restricted  .  They look more like if you dont have much information about the movie its exaggerated in all levels . 
Yeah oh yes besides for example we have found movies that are for children or rather they are not for children but when . 
Showing the ones that supposedly are PGthrirteen that is for children of thirteen years of age that can see it then  ,  but sometimes they say like you say vocabulary and sometimes they show scenes that . 
Of nudity and that so then I say since they will be watching well . 
Yes . 
I dont know I am I am Mexican . 
Mhm . 
That and really there for example yet ah still on television  ,  they care of you and still on movies they still care of you a bit . 
Yes but look at that . 
I say ah I dont know I dont know it makes me . 
Makning making memmoryof the movies we have gone to see lately they are all . 
Very fast um . 
PG thirteen or something like that I dont know where to hold it because the ones we have around here . 
Aha aha . 
Available at the theaters no . 
Aha . 
They are simply not really good . 
No yes . 
Then no lets not worry much abouth that information because my kids are already teenagers we always go to the theater all together . 
Aha . 
We always go for the quality of the movie more than anything else then . 
Yes . 
The the classification they have to orieented us about the movies it really does not give us much information no . 
Sometimes it does not say anything because sometimes for example is says . 
We dont take it in consideration . 
And and it changes for example and when you are watching it bang its is different to what it told you . 
Aha . 
Oh yes for example it says something like `` it has too much violence '' and then its not that violent or sometimes it is or not no it doesnt clearly state the information . 
So sometimes . 
Aha . 
You dont even pay attention to it because for example . 
Yes no eh . 
Those things that they sell for example to sell TV sets that that you see . 
What . 
That they remove or block bad words and stuff like that those work sometimes  ,  but they dont all the time they work but lets say well I dont really own one . 
But one of my friends does and she says they dont work  ,  they dont work properly because they sometimes block words that are not that bad they are not really bad words and then really cuss words are not blocked . 
Yes . 
So uff . 
You see thats when I think we should be involved in the education of our children . 
Aha . 
Weve never done any acts of censorship we . 
Yes . 
Weve tried to discuss or talk about the issue when we see strong scenes . 
Yes . 
We discuss them and we tell them this happens and when we are worried about this  ,  we say  ,  `` hey that was really unnecessary  ,  they couldve cut it out of the film that was rude '' . 
Yes yes . 
No we analyze it and so we take advantage of it as a way to educate our kids . 
Yes . 
It generally works for us it works really good it has I dont they are older now . 
Yes . 
And now he has good common sense about which movies to watch and which ones . 
Yes you see thats true thats a great idea I remember when my mom would watch a movie with me and we would always watch movies after ten in the evening because . 
We knew that we were always going to find . 
Aha . 
Or my mom would take a chance to try and get ugly movies . 
Aha . 
The ones that are not made for children but for example  ,  she would say  ,  I dont know if they were airing a movie that had bad language . 
Yes . 
Or something different than nudity but still like with little clothes on or when we were kids for example my mom would say . 
Aha . 
You can watch it and then you will understand more and she would say . 
Yes . 
That because when you say `` turn around look away  ,  you are not supposed to see that '' its like you are telling them to do  .  So the teenagers will do it because they are wondering why their mom told them not to watch . 
Sure . 
If the movie is playing on television they are wondering why they cant watch it why they are not allowed to . 
So they are going to find out about those things in the end  ,  they are going to have opportunities to see all those things . 
So I dont think yes yes . 
But what yes talking about those things is that censure or the information that that should be censured or . 
Yes . 
That type of thing I have never though of it has good because . 
No yes I believe that . 
Well that there is too much information about movies that it would be convenient to go see with your family . 
Yes . 
And after the movie eat together what happens is and inform ourselves  .  What the movie is about the message the quality with which is made and so on . 
Yes yes its true . 
Because the restrictions that they put well like you said  ,  there is too much violence that can be found in cartoons . 
Yea . 
There are cartoons that are made for children and has exaggerated violence not . 
Oh yes and that is not and are shown during the day true . 
Yeah exactly and in the in the in general I think that that eighty percent of the movies are bad that you must not see them . 
Yes yeah yeah right . 
No and of the other maybe some are medium and less than five percent are worth watching . 
Yes . 
No but with those you have enough to have an an idea of that it is what you must be looking for right . 
Yes . 
There are enough it does not mean that not enough  .  Movies are not made but so many are made you dont have to see them all . 
Thats true . 
Right and then . 
Thats true . 
Yeah we try for example like knowing who they are before we go to a movie . 
Right . 
About the critics towards that movie and then we go . 
Yes . 
Its thats what we always look for we go to see this movie . 
Right . 
And weve already made a decision about what movies and since my kids were little theyve had that education  ,  because he like the movies a lot my wife and i love the movies so . 
Right . 
Never even when they were when they were little . 
Right . 
If there was a movie sometimes we took them even if it was for older people right . 
Right . 
And yeah maybe there could be some scenes a little stronger but one scene doesnt necessarily make the movie . 
Right . 
So we tried to talk about the message Â¿right for example a lot of war movies Â¿right . 
Yes . 
A lot of war movies are for example saving private . 
Yes good evening . 
Good Good evening I am Joe . 
What is your name . 
Joe . 
Joe . 
Yes and what if your name . 
Alex . 
Alex where are you from . 
Ah uh I am here in Los Angeles I think weve spoken before about religion . 
Oh yes yes yes of course I remember I remem . 
We talked on the fourth of october its been some time now . 
Eh what a memory yes yes I remember how couldnt I . 
Where are you from again . 
I am from Colorado Ah Denver Colorado . 
Oh yes yes . 
Well and what do you think about tonights topic . 
Ah I I watch television by by quality not not by classifications . 
Yes me too I dont pay much attention to the classification apart from  .  And I am at an adult stage no of course I have a little girl that . 
Always keeping an eye on what they watch I dont want her to watch programs that uh will give her nightmares or will give her bad ah motivations but there are a lot . 
Of permissive things also in the for example the movies out there  ,  well  ,  every time are I now think that its more violent I dont know if . 
Enough to classify because they are making very violent movies with lots of topics . 
Yes no I I think I am interested in movies and television thru the topics they have . 
Yes . 
Now if it is violent but does not have quality  ,  it is ot a good movie  .  But if it has some violence but it is teaching us something . 
Like a documentary or something from life then it has value . 
Sure . 
Because one can not deny the truth of life . 
Sure . 
One can not live life with blind eyes . 
Like the movie that is well the allies about the Iraq war that I believe is about the experience the soldiers are having . 
This one with the colored actor his name is Jamie I think it is Jamie Foxx . 
Yes . 
And then theres is another white boy that looks like eh is traumatized or something when he is experimenting in Irak  .  Those things are very real and they happen every day there . 
And those movies may be also a political critique . 
And yes true . 
Of the Bush administration maybe it always been an administration obessesed with war . 
Yes . 
With Iraq and misstrusting the public . 
Yes transfering many things from outside of the lie he told in order to invade Iraq that is really ah now one looks and really no no . 
It is not worthy to do that more than one thousand soldiers already died . 
Those movies are very important because the majority of the people are very ignorant of the things that happen in the ge in life . 
Because you dont have information . 
Yes its true . 
The information that we get is all propaganda then is very important to see other versions of what happens in the world not only the Bush administrations version . 
Yes its true So i i think that movie classification today is rather relative  ,  I know they have from thirteen they clearly know that ~X are . 
Obvious true But i think that ~R these days is well beyond what is permitted or not Eh eh that i agree with . 
Allot of movies true that dont make sense for example  ,  you have a lot of gang movies that are gangs  ,  with lots of gangsters are the ones you see because like . 
Mhm . 
They need to see the violence . 
Those movies are bad . 
Yes very bad . 
Because they show the violence . 
And it glorifies it someway . 
Yes and and they the do it no for the value only to sell . 
And that isnt for selling to . 
Certain peoples . 
Yes thats why i see sometimes you boys copying that in the way they dress or walk and even talk or co because those are their heroes . 
And that isnt right that is is corrupting the young Tose shows and movies teach them the fake values and isnt right but the . 
Society the parents the family has a lot to do to make them understand those things and how to treat them true I to my daughter i dont when . 
I see something and i dont what her to see it  .  I dont like i dont force here in such a manner diji saying okay dont watch that . 
Or if not I try in an educational way to teach her  .  Why this program is not good for her instead of imposing it by force in other words . 
Um I me too I have a fourteen year old son . 
Mm . 
And every time he comes to visit me I have to set the control on the sex channels . 
Oh yes . 
Yes because hes obsessed with that because when I leave I go to work and he watches that . 
Yes is easy that . 
So I have had to control him he cant do it anymore  .  Because I I already have it controlled but I have it controlled because it took the step to control it . 
Yes . 
Not because of the classifications So it is the job of each mom and dad to control the television that their kids are going to watch and not blame the classifications . 
Yes exactly Well in in my house I have basic cable and so theres no channel that that crosses the line . 
Do you have teenagers . 
No my daughter is only five years old . 
Oh yes a girl . 
So eh theres a theres a Disney channel that she loves to watch  ,  and also we watch the discovery channel which she likes and theres another other . 
Comedy program that are not that bad that we both watch together that she likes to laugh a lot she likes funny things . 
But when there are things that go beyond that cross the line  ?  well I dont let her watch it because I dont want her to learn those things . 
They make those things interesting when is not morally correct or socially correct . 
Yes you you can teach your kids but the truth is that you as a parent should not have your eyes closed specially when . 
They get older because they are going to have more temptations than what we had . 
Yes e . 
No because we are not good fathers according to culture . 
Which culture is more . 
Because todays teenage culture involves gangs hip hop music a lot of sex and a lot of violence . 
The videos . 
The videos . 
Yes all of these things . 
And its not easy to control everything that you try  ,  and one I try to explain the consequences if you do this . 
Yes he does that if he has sex with a girl  ,  there are consequences that can occur what can happen Id like to understand . 
Yes . 
One has that uh to continuously talk to them about the things that the parents see because I I am a substitute teacher in school . 
Yes . 
They care a a lot about the boys when they are five  ,  six seven  ,  eight nine and ten years old  ,  but when they are thinking they need help the parents are not there . 
We begin to fail and these boys have a lot of temptation and . 
The teenage years are critical . 
And its the teenage years where they start to do more in the life of a boy . 
Exactly . 
Not only when he is five or six years old . 
Its the manner and reason and to think they say we were teenagers also I remember how I was in those years . 
I had my rebellious spirit and all these things but its when parental guidance is most necessary . 
E exactly Exactly Then all depends on the education from the fathers the way theyre into the young ones lives no no the not the clasifications . 
The classification is just a number . 
Yes And if anyone comes to see its like when theyre  ,  all alone with their friends  ,  They can see whatever they want because there is nobody to forbid them to do it . 
Yes . 
Eh but if anybody helps him by taking him the good way in about what is good and what is wrong That helps a lot to reason before doing . 
To make a wrong choice . 
We must give the boys a basis whats good and whats wrong  ,  not only when they are five or six years old but when theyre fifteen sixteen eighteen years old . 
Exactly . 
And it is more important when theyre fifteen than when theyre five  ,  because when theyre five theyre going to follow the easy rules . 
Yes . 
But when theyre already fourteen or fifteen thats another story friend . 
They believe themselves more independents that they dont need their parents anymore . 
They already have friend theyre already involved in culture . 
Yes . 
Mom or dad must go to work they do not have always time its difficult . 
Yes and young people influence nowadays is pretty big I am I agree  ,  but I remember  ,  I also was influenced by my my friends and so when I was younger . 
But I can see that technologies and such things are greater . 
Because really the movies back in time when I was a boy werent as violent as they are now . 
There wasnt video games either television was more restricted Neither all that modern violence  ,  nor blood or bodies were shown like the ~C ~S ~I and all those shows are pretty graphic classics . 
That show things like if they were real . 
Mhm . 
Well its eh young people get use to watch that as acceptable  .  But when I was growing up if those things were shown it wouldve been chaos . 
In fact it wouldnt have been allowed at all but its true times are changing and thats why young people are influenced by it . 
In a big and negative way that this things are acceptable in our society And I well . 
Yes . 
I I hope that when my girl gets to that age becomes a teenager well that Im . 
Now thats going to be in a very little time my friend . 
Yes I know time flies . 
Time flies . 
I remember when she used to be a little baby and now shes jumping running everywhere  ,  learning  ,  lots of new things being curious and asking lots of questions . 
Hello my name is my name is Marisa from Philadelphia . 
Hello Marisa this is Carolina from here from Los Angeles . 
Hello good evening . 
Eh well well here it is good afternoon . 
Today really it is three hours earlier yes . 
Ah I said my mother how is it going to be Listen today we have a very difficult topic . 
Very difficult yes . 
Ay my dear mother because I am from Venezuela . 
Mm . 
Where are you from . 
I am a Spaniard . 
Oh OK . 
Well . 
And and you know that now we are living a very critical moment  ,  exactly with with the United States and the our new president . 
Yes . 
And then o my dear mom . 
Yes I and well I go through something similar what I have to say about the United States is not very positive either for because ah mm  .  I am not for a leftist either in any case then well . 
Wow . 
Of the United States which is what . 
It is strong it is . 
Its very fe . 
Strong and even I dont know if you for some chance of life  ,  you have this knowledge of a page thats called eh TV For All . 
And there you can see the television channels of . 
No . 
All the countries of the world including of course Spain . 
Ah yes . 
Uh huh its called that T V pu eh T eh T V a four . 
T V for all Oh . 
Uh huh a four four and all A L L like television for everyone something like that . 
Oh . 
This there you can see good and we randomly eh we have been looking eh a particular channel from Venezuela . 
Mhm . 
And its a channel of course of the state but but really now the state  ,  not like before that it was of the state but as if it wasnt . 
Mhm . 
And then now we can eh really see the truth  ,  what is that which is happening this that which never was said and especially with our president who is a person very . 
As we say in Venezuela clear and rough . 
Mhm . 
Eh I dont know if you have had the opportunity to hear him in some opportunity . 
Well I think so Yes on television and de after that of ah mm  ,  Ah mm The Summits of the Americas and all that was happening there . 
Exactly exactly then . 
Yes yes they air it here in in Philadelphia you have various Hispanic channels like Telemundo Univision . 
Aha same . 
Galavision and all that . 
Smae as here . 
And you hear it all yes and . 
But you know that all those people regrettably then no they air whatever they want me . 
Is not that here too here we have Government control we say that . 
Exactly exactly . 
Eh only we only hear that no what they want us to hear . 
Correctly correctly and they put including this sometimes they twist . 
Mhm . 
They twist what is happening and then i always meet people that for example  ,  say damn  ,  you what do you have to say about that crazy guy you have as president . 
I do mother they touch me the spot truly that is  ,  i totally agree with that crazy guy ah right what i din want to . 
Say to you was that after they tell all those atrocities no . 
Mm . 
And i my God i try to have patience because its a delicate issue . 
Yes . 
Including now i didnt have any inconvenient here eh including with some Venezuela people . 
Mm . 
Eh people that have lots of years here and lack the knowledge about what really happens there . 
Yes . 
And besides that they are afraid of the idea that they have been slfd that communism that I dont know what that FIdel and that this and that and . 
Well I really dont know how how much knowledge you have but ehm for example  ,  the situation that we are living in Venezuela is a very special situation . 
Hmm . 
Very distinct to Venezuela that is that it doesnt have anything to do with the Cuban reality with what happened in Cuba ehm how I know I know they . 
Had to adopt that system eh which were the necessities that got them to assume that system and and what happened during the time in which . 
Ehm they were applying that because evidently there were mistakes in everything like we also have mistakes right now . 
Of course yes . 
We have been making mistakes however well it is being work on function of that like the president says well ehm clearly he has a claim against . 
The government not against the the country but against the government from here that that they are the ones that they . 
Of course . 
Well they assume some politics how would you say how would you say it best arbitrarily ehm . 
Yes that I mean no has been don in reality  .  Like the question says the worlds police they are the ones that pretend to be . 
Exactly . 
Bosses of everything and and they tell you what is going to happen  .  And if you do not agree well in a bad way you you you have to agree with them . 
Exactly Correct that is and if not then I extort you you you . 
Hmm It is exact . 
Aha then wow ehm . 
With embargo with with everything there might be or the worst ways with violence ouch with war . 
Exactly Exactly so it is a situation rather . 
This . 
Delicate but I believe and from what I have seen that the North American town is waking up in some way I feel . 
Mm . 
And there are a bit more people that are realizing what is really happening because they have them like in a bubble . 
Still a lot is lacking and that is what gives me more . 
Yes . 
It makes me mad because it is so clear to say if someone knows two  ,  plus  ,  two is four and one sees how they are manipulating the people . 
Clearly . 
And one and those and you intend to tell the other person  ,  but look its like this and this  ,  and this You dont realize So they tell you no because you are . 
Liberal or communist or well you . 
Clearly . 
They give you these labels and . 
Some labels continue bad ones in passing . 
Bad bad if you are eh you are not a terrorist  ,  or you are anti anti leave we dont want you if you dont like . 
Correct . 
And I say but yes eh no this country not bad  .  They are not country it is he the leaders of the country . 
Exactly that is what they sometimes say to me what are you doing here . 
Yes . 
I say to him look I could be in Venezuela and not support the president or the fact that you are in a . 
Country or not or you fled your country does not imply that you have a position . 
Mhm . 
Nobody knows the reason for the people being here . 
Ofcourse . 
En eh in the opportune moment but that has nothing to do with the opposition because how many people for example  ,  in Venezuela they dont live in Venezuela and what they are doing is throwing them the enema . 
To the Venezuelan government and the town . 
Mm . 
Well that you dont have to be here or there to support or not support  ?  well it is a position to me when they tell me that it makes me laugh . 
Yes . 
Because what do they do here and well it may be the same thing you are doing thank God That you are here and not in Venezuela . 
No but also in Spain it is the same what happens is that di different the left government  .  But even if it were right it is another mentality because the . 
Town when it is not agreed it is thrown in the streets and and they make manifestations and left here that is never seen I have never seen it . 
Correct correct no Well with all the gasoline problems that have really been well look . 
Oh Mhm . 
In a surprising manner that the people can not eh  ,  no  ,  they dont protest  .  I say my God but what happens what happens with these people well . 
Supposedly to you when it affects your wallet is when you react  ,  but it looks like no  ,  I dont know what happens or they change their car and they buy a more economic car I dont know . 
Yes . 
I dont know what happens but they dont have in general they dont have that necessity to protest under certain things . 
Yes . 
Anyways I tell you I dont know all of a sudden here You were in Pennsylvania you say . 
Yes Philadelphia yes . 
In Philadelphia I dont know but here I have felt that there is a little more that like the people are like starting to wake up . 
Mm . 
I feel that they are rejecting the politics of of of the current president and and like they are seeing that really things are not like they are painting them because . 
Me too I in the beginning like there was no  ,  I did not have access to that to that page  ,  I would say My God  ,  could it be true what they are saying about Venezuela But I would speak with my friends . 
And they would tell me no gir what is that Look And I damn really but look at the power of television is . 
Yes . 
Very big well speaking precisely about the topic power . 
Power yes . 
And television is a huge power . 
Yes they are the ones that control I mean yes here . 
Of course . 
Ehm Philadelphia is a democrat city everybody is democrat but the rest of the state is republican and of people  .  Well look the anglo of of of the people that have things told to them . 
I dont know very very ra very radical . 
Correct . 
Like that very religious very closed or if then . 
Yes yes yes yes . 
No can not it is not going to change so as long as that doesnt change and then . 
Sure sure and what are you doing over there in Philadelphia . 
I well I with my husband here no mm We moved here one year ago ago before we lived in Florida and ehm . 
Okay . 
Im looking for a job we have we just moved and . 
Oh Â¿and do you think its better there than Miami . 
We are in the process of um well i liked it better  .  The thing is that the the work is better here on the north at the south its really saturated . 
Ok ok . 
And Â¿what are you going to do about it thats works first . 
Right right and fi and you came here Â¿And what do you do . 
He is is he works at the pharmaceutical industry doing clinical research uh . 
Ok OK . 
And i well look i do administrative work uh i volunteer and . 
Ok and whatever goes right . 
Well whatever i can find sure . 
But Â¿have you been living long here in the United States . 
Well twelve years . 
Â¿Twelve . 
Uh um . 
Oh dear mother I have been here six years and were about to come back God permits . 
Yeah when i got here Bill Clinton was there the country was in a in an incredible period  .  A lot of work everybody was happy the economy was going up . 
Yeah right . 
Then the republicans came in uh with Bush and everything went to hell like they say . 
Yes sir yes sir and . 
It is todiendo little by little and is is dont know the world Spain is already . 
Yes . 
When I go to Spain all the world to to my husband that is American  ,  they look at him  ,  and he tells me  ,  he has much resentment because he says look at your country is . 
The world is destroyed it is taking over everything and . 
Ay my God . 
They believe that yes they beleive they are you know the owners of everything . 
Yesyesyesyesyesyes . 
And there is power resentment . 
Yes notice that before I used to be a little like thatand  .  And today I understand that is not like that is like us because we do not have . 
Fault of what our government does . 
Sure . 
Then before I also used to see the Americans like that like gringos  .  Well eh thst i understood that they are americans Unites States citizens because this is another concept they work no then . 
Yeah . 
Well we are also Americans if it comes to that . 
Sure . 
And and then after that I start to reflect a little and nono they are not northamericans no so it is the government politics what they do . 
They decide then we sure it reflects against the town against the country . 
Mhm . 
But that is like that is the political state of goverment . 
Yes I dont like Iam Spanish and I am American I one here the needand it seems like but me . 
Sure . 
Eh and I have to persist and I have to deal with the government does  .  But on the hand I dont know I dont like it its a . 
Sure sure yes no and you have exactly you have your right to be in the democracy you have to the right to protest . 
Sure Well but theory practice you dont say anything or rather that . 
I Ah yes yes I dont I hope that this it it . 
Mm Its like a dictatorship yes . 
It doesnt effect anyone eh the project this linguistic thing  ,  but well at least its an fairly controversial issue when I heard . 
Very . 
The issue I was just dying so I said . 
I . 
Why Why . 
I say Im going to talk about Bush because you see that I have so much so much anger  ,  I have to talk about Bush and put it bad because . 
But well thanks to God youre not alone I listen to so many people that say its not  ,  they talk but they rant and rave about him and I say . 
Yes yes yes . 
Of course the people have realized but aside of that . 
That is what . 
They think that the people are so dumb that theyre not going to realize . 
Mhm . 
Realize of the atrocities that they are doing by God . 
No atrocities and later and and the whole throws their hands above their head and exclaims oh my God that cant be I dont know what . 
And no by next week the forget about it because . 
Sure . 
The press and TV move on to something elsetoto distract something to distract then the people forget . 
Sure look you know that a short while ago the Latin American film festival ended . 
Mhm . 
And btw they showed a movie the Argentinian but the directors were Spanish . 
Mhm . 
And then really interesting because you know that the Spanish film industry has many types of movies and this one was a protest movie sort of . 
Yes . 
Documentary where . 
Mhn . 
Okay my name is Ibet With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with . 
This is Mercedes . 
Hello Mercedes How are you Where are you from Mercedes . 
From Honduras . 
Oh Honduras . 
Mhm . 
Wow I have a sister in law and shes from Honduras also . 
Ah where exactly . 
Ay no no Eh I dont know but I know that she is Honduranean as well . 
Ah thats nice . 
Yes it is . 
And where are you from . 
Im from Mexico . 
Ah Where The city eh the capital . 
From the city yes Mexico City Yes And . 
And what do you think about todays issue That is it easier to break up with someone when youre young or or if age makes a difference . 
Mm well good Ive already passed that stage and I am married  ,  but for example ah mm  ,  well  ,  I dont know The experience that I had was was very difficult . 
I feel that its difficult when actually you love the person when actually you dont lover her  ,  I think that its like everything else okay its good we break up okay . 
To each their own . 
Yep . 
Then I believe that when you really love the person  .  But in this case I imagine is because you did not get along with the person . 
O o because I really do not know maybe they did not want to get along between the between the two personsI believe there should be more then nothing . 
Communication in a relationship . 
Mhm . 
Or between in the relationship and if there is not one of the two pieces starts to loose the desconthere is going to be distrust and start . 
The communication deterioratesthen I believe this can can cause a break up  .  But yes i know that I feel that it does hurt . 
And did you ever have a break up that was hard . 
Mm well Eh really yesyesyes because for examplebefore I married my husband I was going with a person and for example eh . 
Same it was not a long time but the firseh my first boyfriend . 
Yes . 
Then this one . 
Is hard always . 
It took me a small while with him with him  ,  it was not too the same  ,  but it was the first illusion  ,  i had dont know and and I was already  ,  i had said well and even said that no with him i will get married . 
Eh I will have three children and I was putting my castles in the air and one time he came and said you know what not me until it was over . 
How . 
Mm . 
I believe there was I had more experience to say until now everything is finished that  .  I know to say eh then I beleive for him uhm . 
It was not very easy but for me yes . 
Mhm . 
And after today yes thateverything was for the best because then I met the one that is now my husband and wow and he is a lot better . 
The truth . 
How good . 
I dont know then . 
So you have only had two boyfriends . 
Thats right and . 
How good Thats best What for Just looking for troubles . 
And you . 
When ther is no need . 
Yes how did it happen to you . 
Lets see Its been long time since eh I dont think I ever had a difficult experience Lets see I think . 
Aha . 
With a boy I was with oh yes With the first bpiyfriend I had we stayed for about two years . 
Aha . 
Mm I remember we decided that then I dont remember the exact reason we would break up . 
Aha . 
But that was ten years ago . 
Wow . 
I was nineteen eighteen it was . 
Are you married now . 
Yes . 
Oh . 
And afterwards we well we let ourselves be seen Afterwards that was not so difficult because we were apart that is he lived on his own and I lived on my own . 
Aha Aha . 
After that another boy that I went out with we also had a few months also he didnt live with me where . 
Aha . 
We were in university where we were and he returned to his country of origin . 
Aha . 
And that ones was also easy because you stop seeing him and quick I mean its easy really . 
Yes . 
In that way . 
Yes . 
Eh What else Lets see which other After that I didnt have any other formal boyfriend until S  .  Only yes the truth is that the experiences that I never had in a certain wa experience that I dont even know really Thanks God . 
Aha No yes its that sometimes I dont know well  ,  for example  ,  I think that in in my case eh with the first person that I fell in love too much . 
Well it was a lot . 
Mhm . 
More than than what eh he loved me I think with me And it wasnt too long I think it was like two or three months . 
Mhm . 
But all the same I was like flying because they said ah  ,  this is my first boyfriend and and probably Im going to get married with him and things like that . 
Yes . 
And in and he and he I think that he didnt think that way he used to say : well  ,  she I dont know if I was his third fourth fifth I dont know . 
So he said yes well Im not going to marry her Im going to be with her and get to know here and thats it On the other hand  ?  well I think I think I was the one that was getting my hopes up because of that . 
And yes to tell you the truth yes it hurts . 
Really . 
Eh yes it hurts because I think you are excited and have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and tells you no well . 
But I think that it must it must hurt a lot more when you already live together like in a marriage . 
Yes . 
I think it must be the worst experience I think of your life  .  Yes and I hope I hope to never go through it because we never know right . 
Mm . 
So I hope to never go through that up to now Ive been married  ,  three years and everything is working wonderfully but everything is fine . 
Thank God . 
A lot of communication and things like that . 
You also say that is nothing everything can be perfect is true always and besides . 
Yes . 
Because there are people that are mistaken theres people that think that that marriage is according to the stage and and everything is peaceful . 
No . 
But and you live with the person day and night and you see it . 
Yes . 
Is impossible well for it to remain Right A situation like that that there is . 
No yes . 
Yes you always love the person but is impossible for there to always be only peace well thats what Im saying right . 
Yes . 
Because one well I I am one it is to be human  ,  and one has to things that bother other people a lot right And . 
Yes . 
Ve to any other people well i am not saying to the person in with that one is particularly but any other person well I know that . 
Eventually well like that we have a saying no no its a coin of the whole world all day  ,  the twentyfour hours of the day for all the rest of the life well . 
So it is . 
Yes . 
Yes the truth I feel I think that it has to be something of the truth  ,  eh very difficult eh to keep it so everything is happy right but . 
Mhm . 
And I think that also that and I think that eh when you take your engagement  ,  for example you can know and accordingly you go knowing the person . 
That of course youre not going to know thoroughly right until now you are married with that person but its but I think that I think that . 
If you see that really you dont get along with that person  .  And for example I have known people eh that they beat up their boyfriends  ,  being boyfriends  .  They beat them and they abused and and they required them to everything that they wanted then . 
I think that those relationships well nothing is going to come from nothing good because if they still arent married . 
And to behave . 
And now they behave so imagine how its going to be if theyre goign to be married  ,  no  ,  but in a little bit theyre going to say you are my owner so now . 
Yes yes . 
Now like they treat her then I think that that a that those relationships eh  ,  I think that theyre not going to work ever I dont know Or or change him or . 
Or change or end a relationship like that I think that if it was a relationship like that  ?  well I I think that it doesnt have to hurt anything on the contrary of . 
You have to think it over if you have a boyfriend that beats you or that . 
Mhm . 
Youre going to rest youre going to say ah its good  .  We finished I dont know I thing that if for example everything starts doing it well and everything . 
Everything is going well and suddenly someone I dont know must travel for example to another country or has to go to another school I think that that would hurt a bit . 
Yes . 
Because everything is fine but only the third circumstances well  ,  they have to separate  .  So I think that this type of relationships well that really really hurts but if its a relationship that . 
That they hit you and things like that no . 
Ah no yes that Bu and the the its eh ironic that Eh  .  Those are usually there are times that those are the most difficult relationships . 
For that for people that are in involved in that type of relationship . 
Thats true . 
Because usually well eh people are when they are in that type of situation its there is like a very low self confidence . 
Aha . 
And then they think that people think that thats what thats whats better that some times its going to eh what Ill be able to achieve . 
I have to endure I have to keep on enduring well . 
Yes . 
And then eh really its not as easy as one thinks to ah  .  He did that to me Im going to send him packing no . 
Thats true . 
Its hard rather because uh its like no its like lets  ,  not say an addict but yes to the to that type of situation that . 
The drama is al its eh very true and and then people dont know how to get out of that cycle of of abuse true thats what happens . 
Thats right yes its true youre right because . 
Yes but . 
For example one time I was in while in Mexico  ,  I met a girl that eh one time she came by with dark glasses to her jo to work . 
Mhm . 
And I told her and now you wear glasses Was it a cloudy dayright And she had a bruise that her boyfriend had made . 
Ah . 
And told her you should I told her I think that you should notI dont know  ,  I told her  .  But I think that you must not allow your boyfriend to touch you . 
Because and she said well it is very difficult to end my relationship with him And I told her Why And she said . 
I still love him . 
Mhn . 
And then wow I told her What How can you love a person who beats you Sometimes she used to come bruised and sometimes he . 
Ah . 
Used to smack her and similar things . 
Ay no . 
Therefore as sometimes you say those type of relationships are the hardest  .  And finally when she managed to do it I remember that she used to cry and cry and cry . 
Every time that she could at every break and similar occasions because she missed him and all that Therefore I think that yessomehow sometimes . 
Some relationships I think that I imagine that it was very painful for her . 
Carolina . 
Fabiola . 
Â¿Whats up Fabiola Â¿How are you um . 
Fine Â¿and you . 
Fine fine Â¿Where are you now . 
In Washington yeah . 
Oh dear mother very far away . 
Â¿And you . 
Im in Los Angeles . 
Ugh . 
Yeah . 
Extremes . 
Were just on the on opposite sides Thats good and Â¿where are you from . 
Chilean . 
Â¿From where . 
Uh Chilean from Chile . 
Oh Chilean Ok Im from Venezuela . 
Â¿From Maracaibo . 
No you know Im not Â¿Why do you know people from there . 
Yeah i know some people from Maracaibo . 
Oh yeah yeah Well you know that they have a stronger accent Right like look and you Mm . 
Eh yes yes . 
Yeah . 
Look and you are you arepa . 
A yes yes yes And how great thats great Because sometimes it very difficult to find Venezuelans and they say no  ,  no  ,  in fact  ,  we know very few Venezuelans this and that and I uh my God . 
We are very few here in fact But in about a mm about mm ten years maybe I think it has increased . 
Yes . 
Mhm . 
I know yes I young woman from Venezuela in Houston . 
Mhm oh Do you work at the Hilton . 
No no no no no In Houston in . 
Oh I heard in Hilton Oh my God oh okay okay . 
Texas No no no I work at home In my house . 
Okay Okay perfect . 
Do you work . 
Yes I work with deaf children . 
Oh . 
Yeah well now in fact I am working with the parents of the deaf children Mhm . 
What a great job . 
Listen yes Very strong work . 
Yes But eh it satisfies you having . 
Yes . 
Having power to help people . 
Exactly exactly and i was doing the same in Venezuela only that i was using the sign language . 
I learned the alphabet there in ah . 
Ah ok ok Chilean off course no . 
I learned yes . 
Mhm . 
But with signs . 
Mhm correct But here is oral . 
Oh here my daughter taught me the alphabet eh and some words . 
Okay . 
Not all of them some like `` I love you '' and other . 
Mhm . 
Yes small words . 
Mm okay . 
But pretty . 
Yes yes now Im with the first oral part No Im like at the other end of mm from mm . 
Of the profession Because this is an here the children are given incentives to talk . 
How To talk . 
Mhm . 
Without listening but talk do . 
Yes no yes Because they mm with auxiliary earpieces are able to listen in . 
Ah . 
Then what you do is that they train aurally so that they can recognize the sounds . 
How beautiful . 
Mhm mhm yes yes That is like like a possibility  ,  they have well to be able to speak clearly  ,  They will never be able to speak perfectly him you you will feel the difference as her speak . 
But they will definitely have that option since That even in eh its  ,  there are some parents who combine sign language with the oral part No Depending on . 
Depending on the grade of the auditory loss of of of the child  .  If it is very profound wherein there are no possibilities even with the best operation then there . 
Eh we utilize sign language as complement . 
What a hard job for parents . 
Mhm It is great work truthfully It is very very hard  ,  But it is very eh rewarding  .  Well in the end eh you have your your reward  ,  well  ,  Of course  ,  you have to realistically put on well like we say put on the batteries . 
Because in another form mm well hardly well they are going to achieve it well . 
What is your opinion on the topic that they gave to us today about . 
Well you see it a candle topic Candle candle truly  .  I think that the relationships between partners are not at all simple You have to fight with a person that . 
That is different from you that comes from another world  .  Another culture another way of being and then attempt to have a single project like . 
Eh sometimes it is a bit difficult No But I think that love is the only thing that makes it possible for barriers to be overcome more than anything . 
Only if theres if theres love and if theres a lot of disposition from the partners  ,  so that those those differences and those mm those eh tiffs that can be had at any moment . 
They overcome themselves you think so . 
Yes Of course I think suddenly more of love and all of that Because love is like is . 
Mmh . 
It is acquired with time . 
Of course . 
And and with and with enthusiasm Then I believe that you want to maintain your family  ,  you have to want to keep a family because there are very few people who love . 
Mmh . 
And thy are so young that the first thing that occurs to them when they have the opportunity fight split up . 
Correct . 
They dont work hard And they love each other and they love each other  .  Maybe even more than a couple who has been married for 30 years . 
Of course . 
But they struggle day to day and they overcome problems they go above problems . 
Correct . 
And this is what I believe that they need mm people nowadays have patience and no . 
Yes . 
To think that if they decided to stay with that partner or marry that partner . 
Of course . 
Well it is forever already Though there are problems not to go running after the first problem that you found . 
Of course Well see that I with mm my husband  ,  we ave we are going to reach eight years of marriage . 
And I twelve . 
And twelve imagine And and really we have had well  ,  two critical moments  ,  critical to the point of nearly separating  .  And and there was a point when maturity there plays an important role No . 
Yes . 
In another moment in my life Id have done it . 
Me too . 
Aha . 
But I had done nothing important . 
I hadnt done nothing important either nothing But look I dont see a damn thing . 
Ah yes as I said stop me if I fall What is the problem . 
Exactly . 
But now I think three things . 
I understand But right now is that true what you think and say no  ,  but he has other things That me Im focused on the good things that he has : I say he is different from me  ,  he cant think like I can  ,  and it doesnt bother me if he doesnt think like me . 
But also that I dont want to let it affect me . 
Ah I understand I feel the same as well . 
No I understood exactly But unfortunately good the first was horrible because I thought that it was the end of the world And good  ,  I felt and waited a long time that one day we tried while I thought it was a good day but is that whats happening . 
We have we were married three weeks we had almost gone  .  Three weeks Never in life had we lasted three weeks without seeing each otherwithout hablarnose And sleeping in the same bed . 
Oh my god . 
Mm horr horrible horrible I said look do you understand this So it seems . 
I havent touched it It hasnt come to that . 
Hey its not that bad its very rude on our part in reality  .  He said you know what To me I think that this is full of crap . 
It does not have to make sense If you want to continue with the project  ,  we will continue it  .  If you do not want to continue we wont continue it I love you . 
I love you But this cant continue because you go for a day and I go for the other And the truth  .  I think that I love you And thats why I love you . 
Is this what I need to define it this way Why its insensitive on our part to live this way Besides in this way I dont believe in God So what . 
We will working on it Because irrespective of how serious may be the situation that luckily wasnt so serious but that neither side wanted give in right . 
It was pride . 
Fool pride Because that . 
Yes its up to nothing . 
To nothing But the opposite . 
It only affect . 
Exactly then well fortunately we are back on track And then after we had another  .  However this was smaller I think the first one was the one which really left us marked . 
And it went well well furthermore I was ready I was ripe for the picking  .  As we say here I said stop Ive got this fair . 
Ripe for the picking is like ready to throw in the towel . 
Yes Ready to throw in the towel I said nothing  ,  no  ,  no  ,  no Im  ,  not going to co Not going to allow it  .  I say Im not allowing you to do it i mean youre wrong . 
If something I learned from this life is to search for solutions to problems than can be solved . 
Sure . 
Cause What are we going to do with a mediocre relationship  ,  I dont want a mediocre relationship  ,  As you yourself says there are people whom spend thirty years together and thats a crap of a relationship . 
Yes . 
That whom trat each other bad This look this piece of dont know what thing what whats that Why would I want it . 
Mm No is a girl and sometimes they treat each other well but they dont love each other . 
Exactly that too . 
They are they spend all their lives together . 
Yes yes yes Look Is that a thousand things happens  ,  really Couples  ,  go through so much that is is an interesting topic Because you say . 
That truly there is people whom look they like a lot each other  ,  but not love each other Like well I got accostumed to live with him . 
Right They respect and and . 
Exactly . 
And what they wanted to form was a family and so . 
Exactly There are others that dont There are others that definitely  ,  they do whatever they feel like and they keep up an image . 
Right And they are others that say love If theres no love theres nothing . 
Theres nothing theres nothing Its true that there has to be a big  ,  big love Thats  .  Why Im telling you because I feel that in my relationship what was possible was love . 
Because truthfully with a situation that was so difficult like we were living  .  If there hadnt have been love it would have no  ,  we would have broken up  ,  just that simple Because it just wouldnt have made any sense . 
It doesnt make any sense to continue something that eh wheres  .  There no love Well I feel that yes A lot of love and many of his promises that you were talking about to actually love . 
To be here because you want to be because it was worth it . 
Because sure because nobody is forcing you You want to be here and and you fight And in order to maintain yourself . 
Exactly exactly . 
You could have a couple its difficult And when you have it you have . 
Exactly . 
The hardest after is to keep it going . 
Sur thats the hardest Yes sir And to seek how to be constantly in that eh eh in that harmony that that like new things that were going to do differently lets do not slip into a routine . 
Eh . 
But no Its that as time goes by you know  ,  but the important things is that you can not leave her . 
Exactly sure I recognize that . 
And that the system will also bring you to that conclusion . 
Of course Of course Your husband is also Chilean . 
No he is from here . 
Uy imagine Like eh it is a little more I mean  ,  it is not that it is more difficult Actually I feel that love can do anything . 
So easy I say . 
You think it is easier . 
And eh well for certain things easier . 
Oh OK OK Because my husband is Venezuelan and . 
For certain . 
And sometimes I say I believe that that has nothing to do with with nationality I believe that those are universal things . 
Yes I believe that for me it is easier because sometimes the the are very entertaining because I dont understand everything he says or he says it fast  ,  then it doesnt go well no no fighting had no point . 
A lot with him because it makes me laugh . 
And what what was that you said . 
What do you say Or when we are very . 
Bad . 
Hello . 
Hello .

From Santiago also . 
Of course I lived there in Santiago and in Concepcion . 
Oh okay . 
Sure . 
Look what what a small world . 
Yes precisely Sounds good . 
And have you been in this thing a long time This thing of calling on the phone . 
Because no I dont know of what I registered Monday to do . 
Oh yes . 
And i didnt know anything so far from . 
Â¿Hello . 
I mean hello yeah . 
Oh ok . 
Oh i wish it wasnt this phone its kinda bad but sometimes . 
Oh ok . 
No but i was saying that Ive been taking calls i dont know . 
Oh Â¿youre uh youre calling every day . 
Well sure i started once and i got four calls but i could only take one . 
Oh ok . 
Yes . 
Yes yes i got called this week too but i couldnt answer . 
Well uh . 
This week Ive been kinda lazy . 
Right yeah well sure . 
Yeah . 
Im telling you its been . 
Yes . 
Fun they give you a subject to . 
To talk about to have something to talk about i think . 
No ah it must be . 
Yes i think so . 
I thought I thought this study was to make a phone menu and stuff like that . 
Eh . 
So for hospitals theaters and stuff people wanted to talk about things about health and stuff for example . 
No its just so happens that I was told that matters were so because you have to talk about personal things . 
Ah because you should not or because you do not want to do . 
Because you should not like personal things . 
Ah . 
But you never know if another person is on the phone . 
Ah of course ah OK . 
So thats why they give you subjects to have to talk about . 
Ah ok I thought it was part of the study they wanted to hear words in Castilian and Spanish I dont know . 
Oh okay . 
No but no . 
All they told me was that I had to talk about issues of importance . 
Of course with . 
Have a theme dont talk as a pure head of sin . 
Of course is the fruit . 
So if what . 
Yes . 
This Yes you like it here . 
No no of course Idaho is good . 
Ah . 
Yes I was in Washington near Seattle when I came to the United States of course . 
Ah . 
And now Im in Georgia Im in the south so its as good here as it is for everyone there and Im in Atlanta . 
So even more to be posted there . 
Ah . 
But Idaho for example is really rural whereas here it isnt . 
Yes its like the countryside everything is really just the countryside . 
Yes I would imagine myself there why not it depends . 
Yes its like how there isnt much nightlife there I dont know . 
I bet The thing is being in Atlanta its a pretty big city Supposedly life should be really great here you see . 
In two or three years . 
Ah . 
And also all the stores and the bars and the clubs need to close at 2 in the morning . 
Wow at 2 . 
At 2 in the morning everything is closed . 
Oh and why . 
So the the reason is that is has the the sector like like the and that in Atlanta it is called Bucks Head . 
Ehm . 
And like and already like two three years ago there were some crimes and things and three people were killed They killed her three persons . 
Oh . 
Around there then the city On top of the new major  .  What do I know then yes that the people well are killing the . 
Oh . 
But the same is but it is like is like yes a city like that has to have by obligation . 
Yes well And like but over there do people use any cars or is there more like public . 
Oh it is not of many cares too many cars yes . 
We oh well the same because to go out at two am is not that . 
Well it is that . 
If you have a car or something like that . 
Sure It is not that the bad thing is that for example  ,  I would prefer one thousand times to have a a system  .  So so good for the simple reason of the problem the . 
Expensive and on top of that . 
Yes . 
A lot of congestoin . 
Oh okay . 
The sure it is like a horrible traffic that is delay like to any place yes like . 
Yes . 
Yes the car . 
Here is totally different . 
Oh yes like over there . 
Well there are so many cars People have cars everyone because its a necessity something like that . 
Of course . 
Because there is no bus But . 
Oh . 
Are like dont dont take too long to go to so many places to the city where I live is like half of Santiagos port there are much less people because . 
Yes well . 
Because you knew that here things are like since the houses are much bigger they are further apart things like that . 
Of course of course they are in or . 
And no I am in Idaho Falls . 
Ah yeah yeah . 
In Idaho falls . 
Yeah . 
In I am going to a much larger city then . 
Mm . 
There in a much larger city but . 
Of course . 
Where we are no is country . 
Ah how great is the same like of course Eh and gave a thing over there like this one this one the one that The Washington University . 
Ah . 
We were Latinos and . 
No here is a lot of machines thats for sure . 
Ah ready . 
A lot of Mexicans and it is more a rural place . 
Mm . 
They hire a lot of Mexicans to work in . 
Ah . 
The land and things like that . 
Oh sure . 
Then almost all people you see is mexican Also if the people see you they think you are Mexican . 
Sure yes yes . 
At least latinos they say ey Mexican . 
Sure the wheat . 
Then you are telling no no no . 
No . 
I am not Mexican . 
Sure what i like a lot is when they believe that i am Palestinian or asian if i go to some restaurants . 
Yes . 
Yes like from middle east they tell me . 
Ehm . 
And they try to talk to me in Arabic I dont know They think I have more of of of an Indian face or something like that  ,  but of cuorse and is there discrimination over there or not . 
Uhm uhm yes the same but not the same . 
Oh but . 
That is yes like everywhere else . 
Ah sure . 
The same is that more than anything it is with people that are Latin but dont know much speak but . 
Ah sure . 
Because there are a unch of people just the same that go to buy and dont know anything about . 
And sure sure . 
English so and then they have to walk no but people just the same you know like everywhere else they are sort of . 
Yes yes Sure . 
Because over there they are very discriminating you know that . 
Well over here is like super today Atlanta and all of the south is like sixty pr cent black like that . 
Oh okay . 
So it is like the fact that it is more diverse like that it is like much more ehm acceptable  .  I dont know but at the same time to the south is the south of the . 
United States has that history of being one of the more racist places of the whole United States in fact here . 
Oh . 
There was slavery and all of that then The same over there  ,  a a certain minority of Whites that hate any ethnic group and have their strange demonstrations and all of those things but . 
Ah but things strong like that yes . 
Ofcourse . 
They fight strong . 
Yes but . 
Here no its not something massive its not like something semi heavy but no no like group things like that no . 
Of course for example in the rural parts of Georgia  ,  they saw things like were seen in the Ku Klux Klan I dont know . 
Oh yes really . 
Yes still . 
Oh mm . 
And that those rare things but they are are very very far the city . 
Eh . 
It is inside the city of Atlanta one is in a place more civilized and so those thigs no . 
Eh . 
Yes by luck look what was happened . 
Oh Oh how strange . 
And how did you get to iadho like that . 
Oh I married a gringo . 
Ah ofcourse A Idaho . 
Yes I was married to a gringo thats how I came here and you how how . 
Well my mother married a gringo . 
Oh yes . 
Yes because of that we came we went to Seattle in ninety one I had Eleven years . 
Mm . 
But my dad stayed in Chile and that is why I come and go like that . 
Oh okay . 
Clearly . 
Mm okay . 
And a . 
Okay . 
Interesting . 
So now you are single . 
Something like that I am like we live together . 
Oh okay . 
Of course clearly . 
Okay Ah mira And and what do you call it do you like it or not . 
Yes because or its like I am in the city  .  I like it more city because of I am from the city or the countryl  .  For example I lived in San Rafael I dont know if youre familiar but . 
He walked from San Felipe to the Andes which is in the question more more rural and you couldnt imagine how . 
Oh . 
Typical Chilean country and that enchanted me . 
Yes . 
Like a valley what do I know Oh I like to be in the city  ,  because it is it is more hip what do I know there are more things to do . 
But I dont know this makes me . 
Ah . 
Then . 
Oh esta bien . 
Yes . 
Its not like . 
But . 
Well its a super drastic change for me to come here . 
Yes I imagine . 
Because I was accustomed to live in the city and here  ,  But there is a city near I could find all I need but the life is more . 
Is more calm just saying . 
Sure . 
More calm and everything just it is not good because for example  ,  eh  ,  There is not so much crime as in a bigger city grande . 
Sure . 
But is kind of bored . 
Yes I imagine . 
Kind of . 
But the same in touchm is hard too . 
Here Yes its the same but not too much Like at least Chico is not that Big . 
Well Oh Hello Juan Marcela . 
Hello How are you My name is Juan Marcela . 
Yes How is it going . 
Listen didnt we talk the other ay with . 
I think so You are in Texas and I am in North Carolina . 
Yes I Pleasure . 
Yes pleasure . 
I have not forgotten you Did we practice together no yes Listen but I am tocan health . 
Yes . 
Do you have social security here Are you covered . 
Eh I am covered through my husband . 
Uh uh . 
And the children are covered like that so we are alright . 
Ah well we We are not . 
It is a problem no . 
We are not covered It is a problem because well something can always happen no . 
Mm We are very healthy but you never now . 
And him yes And the other day I went precisely  ,  I went to an ah office in which supposedly they gave you some type of I mean pension for . 
People like that in the community no . 
Yes . 
And well already the papers that they asked with my address and proof of work  ,  And finally  ,  they found an excuse to to not to not give it to me because they asked . 
Me to give information about the person who was hiring me and in that moment  ,  because the person didnt want to give out the information no . 
Mm . 
And and in my case I have a son who has epilepsy . 
Ah . 
And then he needed some kind of tension of emergencies here things that . 
And they didnt give you eh the attention . 
Eh no No no They didint want to describe me  .  Really Then in the cases if I price with him he was sick one time He got worse . 
And then I had to to go back to Mexico  ,  and that there he got attention from a doctor who sees him . 
Mm . 
And they prescribed him and then already once I ran out of medication Eh normally I buy it in Mexico and . 
Yes but it can be cheaper . 
It is a problem with the prescription and then a friend who is a doctor had samples and he gave me medical samples . 
Yes that helps what a thing . 
No yes he gave me Then yes it is something that we think that well  ,  there should be some kind of more flexible no  .  So if there is a community but it is a certain kind of community . 
Yes No I think that the whole system is going to have to fall before they do something different Because I think that it is too difficult to fix it because there are . 
The costs of the costs of everything depend on demand And then if these costs are rising rising and rising . 
Yes yes . 
Because there is more demand and because people pay it And then they raise the costs because people ask more and more money and people who work ask for more money  ,  it is ia  ,  vicious circle And then how can suddenly they can have socialized medicine . 
Yes . 
It is impossible because all of that people already are like . 
Yes It should be . 
Money does not stop being like a drug you see They are already used to a certain amount of money . 
Uh uh . 
And then now suddenly they are not going to have it . 
Exactly It is a problem it is a circle that works with the earnings here it is stronger isnt it . 
Yes Of course it is . 
Then the interest is more ugly . 
We would stop making bombs and going to war Look all of that money that could be used . 
Mm . 
For schools or on a medical system of social medicine . 
Mm Mm Well if they would lower it just a little bit . 
Mm yes . 
With that Because over here I dont know over there where you are living  ,  But here if somebody has money it is the nurses and the doctors Isnt it . 
Yes well nurses are paid very well because few nurses you know there are less . 
Then Mn And Well so here Like that as they say time a good care with a woman that is around thirty years old for example no . 
Mm . 
And is a nurse and like that it passes When you find out if they really are nurses . 
Yes Tell me twenty thirty dollars an hour . 
Yes yes to me Uh uh Then h ere in this case  ?  well like it does get offered In Canada it is my understanding well they have much medicine isnt it . 
Mm . 
Then any Canadian resident has rights to medical services just to be there and they dont have any economical consequences . 
No bu the difference is that they started right . 
Yes Exactly . 
Its like Argentina my parents have all the medical bills paid . 
Oh . 
All medical coverage is paid they pay a little amount not so much . 
Yes this is one thing we should make at least paying something . 
Yes . 
Having some type of social security but even that is really . 
Yes its really expensive . 
Its expensive right I dont know how drugs are her but well in Mexico is cheaper . 
All over the world All over the world . 
And there is more competition there in drugs Thats weird . 
Yes there was a drug my son was taking there and well when we moved here we couldnt find it . 
Oh . 
So we went to Argentina last year I went to the drugstore and something you pay more than 50 dollars here . 
I bought it there for 12 dollars . 
Yes yes . 
12 dollars same company and everything . 
Yes . 
And it could have been less if I bought the other brand the unknown brand . 
Same yes . 
But I dont understand . 
And in the case of Mexico for example my sons medicine theres like five six brands . 
Mm . 
With similar ingredients . 
Mm . 
No yes ye And here theres only one And second that in the literature is not the best And listen  ,  but only the laboratories I thought that all the American laboratories well . 
So at the time of competition well here theres a monopoly . 
Yes yes yes . 
Big interest in everything no . 
Thats true It really is true . 
Mm . 
I mean I according to things like this . 
But . 
According to what specialty they have to operate here You know what you would have to do . 
Yes . 
Why dont you contact an organization that is called the Shriners . 
Mm mm oh yes . 
Shriners yes . 
Yes I already know I already know . 
Eh because they help the children . 
Mm . 
Now I dont know if they specialize in a specific disease Or if they cover everything because perhaps . 
Mm . 
You can communicate with them and say to them he hears we have this boy and this is his condition and this is our situation . 
Yes . 
And perhaps they can help in some way Because the Shriners are dedicated to helping to paying for the medical care of children That they cant pay . 
Uh uh Uh uh Then yes he sees yes . 
Of the parents who cant pay . 
Yes he knew of that He hears what already it was time or what . 
What I know they say that it is twelve minutes but the twelve minutes seems like half an hour . 
Ah I noticed that Yes I only knew and thought it was for me And I much smaller without you tiring and for more style . 
Yes Perhaps uncertain but not to find out you see it cost nothing . 
Mm I am going to crash . 
And also if you call to Catholic Charities . 
Uh Uh uh That yes . 
Perhaps they perhaps they have what I know a wave or something you see that it can help you in . 
Yes yes its very simple because in reality good on the one hand  ,  the maintenance is a medicine that this person who helped me with the sample says no man this . 
Here they give them to us you have no problem Just go to some community center or something and . 
Mm . 
There are many samples And but knowing a bit more about the advances is that I can give the medicine that we think that a deeper diagnosis could improve the life of my son with . 
With the epilepsy no . 
Sure . 
Because it was under control but lately it has been nearly two years in which it has been uncontrolled It has been out of control . 
Mm And of course hes growing up and then maybe that medicine doesnt work anymore they have to give him another one . 
And well he gave me he gave me yes Yes  ,  they gave him another one The potentialized it and it didnt sit  ?  well on him and then Well what can you do he had to stop using it and return to the basics . 
Mm . 
Yes yes we was very ill . 
What a thing . 
Yes yes well so you know its a matter of experimenting . 
And you you must live with your hearts in your mouth . 
Well yes sometimes yes . 
And that causes a lot of stress . 
Always yes . 
Much stress . 
The life even if you dont say it your always looking after him all the time . 
Mm yes yes yes . 
No Afterwards you know that youre always hoping that id doesnt happen  .  Well I dont know that that it happens really no  ,  But well thats a trauma but my poor son because hes a teenager so . 
Mmm . 
It happens at school so he feels really bad . 
Of course he is ashamed How old is he . 
Yes it is a heavy load its a really heavy load for him . 
How old is he . 
17 . 
Oh its just a teenager . 
YesHey getting back at subject I think there must be a a good ones her . 
Yes Do you know where you can ask At teachinh hospitals . 
System of . 
At medics at teaching centers in medical schools . 
Oh . 
At those place plenty of times at different apartments . 
Yes . 
They check people who cant afford a normal consultation They take care of people like us who cant afford an specialized doctor . 
Mm . 
And we do not have . 
Oh I see . 
And they take note of whatever they give us and after that they charge . 
A reasonable account Something we can afford sometimes they dont even charge at all . 
Hmm . 
Of the month And that thats interesting I had to get an abscess checked It turns out I have something called ADD . 
Yeah . 
And a few years ago I thought I had it  .  But in the end I went and I had kind of selfdiagnosed and in the end  ,  I found here the teaching hospital of the University of North Carolina . 
Yeah . 
And they didnt charge me anything and they performed all the tests on me . 
Ah really . 
Yes . 
So everything is very well to which orientation are we going right in fact  ,  the place I went to precisely is called University System healthcare system or something like that but . 
Ah yes then its that with the . 
Then its precisely there where they bounced me . 
With the University eh . 
I told him . 
Ah but what a thing . 
Mm Uh uh then they told me no you have to give us information  .  I had a letter with my earnings and so on no . 
Mm . 
But not that we need the social security of your employer And then thats when they didnt want to anymore . 
They didnt want to give you that information . 
No but not me But well now I have my social security myself . 
Oh then maybe now you can . 
Yes employed . 
Mm . 
Well maybe Ill go . 
Maybe now you can . 
Uh uh . 
Hello how are you my name is John . 
Hi good eh matt here . 
I am in san antonio Matt i think we have spoken before you are in Philadelphia . 
Yes and you are . 
Oh look its a placer talk with you again . 
Yes how have you being . 
Hey everything is fine what do you think about today theme . 
No i didnt listen what is the theme . 
The theme is the technical devices i mean the technology  ,  the devices that you use more and you depend of them how do you consider these dependency . 
And how consider the technology question no in your daily life  .  If it become more in a problem than in a solution or something like that . 
This include cars . 
Its the same issue that i was thinking sure they must added no . 
Yes because it is a machine you know . 
Exactly so yes if the cars seems to be so important no then i thought better is a computer bu no . 
Yes the most obvious its the computer but its not the only one . 
OK exactly but sometimes seems like a personal element depending of the case  ,  so it can be a car no because the computer is a tool every time more . 
So more than once we said that belongs to the institution where you are no its more than a tool work . 
Oh . 
But that tool is very personal seems like a car no . 
Yes thats why the same things you buy a car and always you are using it and always you have to mantained always its a part of your life . 
Why do you need to look after the car yes do you know . 
Yes yes exactly besides as Im here in Texas . 
Ah . 
I feel that the automobile culture here is like a reminiscence of the culture of the horses too . 
Did you used the horses more . 
No it is like a horse it is something like very very very personal very close . 
Yes . 
Over the course of ones life here we take care of them and its very important just like a horse from that time no . 
Yes . 
For some years yes because if they say no the devices that have to do with communication are the most important in our age like computers . 
 . 
< very bad phrase > . 
Eh as permitted by the information management and everything no . 
Yes because here in Texas yes because up here in Texas . 
But . 
You need the car do you know for work . 
Yes . 
Then . 
Exactly and here the working people are like in those days like mules no they need a pickup truck . 
Ah yes yes . 
Pick up truck no give and do not leave if you notice like theres a work culture thats very very important . 
I see . 
And the computers okay well in all houses there is television  ,  telephone and computers practically no  ,  but but like that  ,  there are other dimensions  ,  no of the technological question then the car seems to be . 
The most most important . 
Yes but the questions on the subject were which . 
Ah what a what technical question technology is most important in your life  ,  what is that which we are discussing right now  ,  if it would have to be the car or it would have to be the computer what do you think . 
Well for me it would be more my computer and my cellular telephone . 
Uh huh exactly . 
Because you know because I have my cellular and Im always with it . 
Uh huh . 
And okay I have become accustomed to having a cellular telephone you know . 
Uh huh . 
Before I didnt have a cellphone until I was like twenty years old  ,  but now that to that I live in Philadelphia in the city and that Im not always at home for . 
Im not always going back home for for you know to look at my messages . 
Yes yes . 
Okay always always I am always I have my cellphone . 
You have your cellphone . 
I think that its very its like surprising that almost everybody has a cellphone here in the United States . 
Yes notice that yes its very important what youve just said a  ,  while ago  ,  when I worked I had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important no . 
Yes . 
And well in the computer there were the messages always it was in the internet  .  The mail more than the telephone neither cellphone nor anything no . 
Yes . 
The computer was the most important . 
But now . 
But now With the type of work that I ` m realizing the auto is the most important the computer because the auto is what let you reeel Type of work that I ` m doing is more . 
More physical no Then the auto is converted in the ins in the apparatusmore important and the computer for a second diagram also is very important . 
But of course is by the type of good work . 
Well for me I think very well yourself and yourself was working for Texas  .  And obviously you know There is more hm How you say I undertand that there is more like lands and someplace there understand . 
Way more space . 
Yesyes . 
For in the city having a auto it can be convenient as well . 
Yesyes that yes . 
Because always you have to try to park and to have to pay a lot to park and the gas station is not close by and I do not know it . 
Is more one problem that one torque that one help obviously Understand . 
Oh yes . 
It is better to have an auto hm I think . 
Yes hm yes no maybe here yes for the distance that needs to go in the job the auto is fundamental . 
Aha clear . 
But yes in in the city I think yes the most important and depends in the job alsoso hm maybe it can be a computer no Then . 
The the next question or or the apparatus of communicationno How you say the cellular and . 
Aha . 
And that and hm and the other question is if you consider that those hm  ,  these technologies will convert more into a problem than than in . 
Well what type of problems would it have no like you just said with the car the problems that have to do with parking . 
Aha . 
No here in Texas there is not is not where I am there are no major problems  ,  no with parking  .  There is a lot of space everywhere no it still does not have the . 
Lets say those problems here but but in the end  ,  I dont know  ,  I dont know what you think above above everything i would say that well  ,  in regard to the care issues with cars and all of that  ,  well  ,  like it is not seen as a large problem unless it is . 
We could consider as a problem the interests created around the the auto industry and like sometimes they seem to affect the same technology development of the . 
Of transport no for example . 
Aha but dont you think as well that it is that it is very like great that that has changed like in sixty years . 
Yes . 
So we look how seventyfive years in the past there were no cars but these days almost everybody has . 
Yes yes yes but yes . 
And the same thing with the computers they have they have computers that are not going to let come out to the market until like ten years because . 
Since . 
Because they have th the things very advances and the things have not ___ have not _____ . 
Yes . 
Gotten paid for their development costs you understand me I dont know how to explain it very well but . 
Exactly yes well as they say as well with the auto industry  ,  no is the auto industry would have advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry maybe the car could transport us with . 
One hundred kilometers with only one liter of gas . 
Aha . 
No and instead of costing lets say twenty thousand dollars it would cost you two thousand dollars . 
Yes . 
If that was the case no but like technology in this case industry  ,  it has its own interests  .  It like moves on you know what theyre talking now about hybrids . 
That at lot of them say that they are not affordable that its really a matter of image that companies do and when it comes to see the the return tables . 
Of the hybrid cars well I though they would be a lot more efficient but I think what theyve achieved is a minimal efficiency . 
Yes . 
No no I dont think they have a real hmm that they are a really big technological breakthrough given the efficiency that . 
Yes that was a very important breakthrough . 
Excuse me . 
You dont think its an important breakthrough . 
No I dont think its so important taking into account that the efficiency they show is not radically different from the other cars I mea . 
Ah . 
According to the tables an economical car will give you maybe thirtysix miles per gallon . 
Yeah . 
And a Hybrid can give you fifty . 
No ah yes there are cars now like like the Ford cars . 
Uhm well . 
The pickup well the pick up trucks no because they are changing them so they can be more efficient you know . 
Aha . 
But but the expedition and those huge cars and that spend like that  ,  you know  ,  it can only run like around twenty  ,  miles  ,  eighteen miles per gallon something like that that is a huge expense . 
Yes exactly and and sure and but at the same time  ,  for example  ,  with those autos of ehm  ,  there have been small cars that give you almost the same mileage than the hybrid and they are not hybrid isnt it . 
By small cars new that are not in the Northamerican market that are in the European or Latinamerican market where they have to be much more efficient . 
Oh yes . 
And smaller no so if we compare the costs of a hybrid against a smaller  ,  European car or or of teh ones that circulate in Latinamerica so then . 
No it is much more expensive to have a car which is because of the initial cost  ,  and why it will be saved a lot in in gas it ends up . 
Being less than to what a car has a good economy car no . 
And why is it that . 
European . 
Why is it that the United States is one of the few nations that has this that only here you have those huge cares you know . 
Yes it is yes . 
Over there in other countries everybody has small cars that well different different culture you know but . 
Yes I precisely years ago when there was the problem with petroleum in the eighties or something like that I recall . 
Ah aha . 
I thought that it there was going to be a change in the culture because they started to to develop smaller cares here in the United States . 
Yes but . 
I thought well there is going to be a change in the culture  .  But that was a thing of only the moment no  ,  it seems because it has some huge cars they continue like . 
Im Ana Maria . 
Ah Faviola hi . 
Hello Faviola . 
How are you . 
Fine and you Hows the weather there where youre at . 
Great its sunny but cold . 
Sunny and cold ah . 
Cold . 
Its bad here its really cold here What do you think about movies Have you already talked about that subject . 
Yes . 
Ive talked about that subject before too . 
Yea Ive talked about it and Ive talked about the uh one I remember specifically talking about was about violence . 
Mhm . 
That it that they didnt like the idea of going to see movies And I told them that the world that the world is it has violence . 
Mhm . 
Its always had it and Ive had the chance to teach children about peace and love with the TV or or in the world  ,  and later when they go out into the real world at school . 
They find that that kids hit each other that they dont know how to defend themselves Especially when you have only children . 
Uh huh . 
So uh I think that its OK that they rate the movies how they do  .  I think its the responsibility of adults even where their kids can watch TV . 
I agree the respon the most important responsibility of parents . 
They are doing their job them of the movies and . 
They are earning their money what is your job . 
Its his business you . 
Doing his business yes . 
Yes today the one that wants the one that wants to see he doesnt want to see him anymore it is not their responsibility they see . 
Of yes . 
That they sell . 
Yes . 
It is what they do it is not their fault it is the fault of those that buy it . 
Yes of who likes the product because of that . 
Yes . 
With you it is the maximum responsibility if it is violence  ,  sex  ,  whatever it is protect a child The biggest responsibility is of the parents even with classification . 
Because there is a classification of a movie for example PG thirteen . 
Yes . 
And you have a small child of that age and you let him watch that movie it is your responsibility . 
Yes . 
It is because you let him and you thought what can be done Isnt it true . 
Exactly . 
Then because I the the the association o o o whatever it is they one who puts the classifications already has it then . 
I believe yes we believe more or less the same thing in that Faviola  ,  because in the end the responsibility of raising taking are of and wanting them to see or not see . 
Your sons or your family eh You as a mother or your husband as a mother . 
Mm I believe also that I agree completely and the other normally  ,  the children have access to television when the parents are out . 
Exactly . 
The kids are alone . 
Mhm . 
And there is not father to teach them or tell them you should not watch this you should watch . 
Or if they go to a sleepover you dont know either . 
Sure no because you dont have any idea . 
If they go to a sleepover and the watch a movie  ,  they watch a movie  ,  and they dont have any control at that house or whatever . 
You dont know either . 
Exactly . 
I believe it is important to give to your children one that they respect those signs if yone give them good principles at home One as a famly then teach them things . 
Sure . 
That really I dont like or why I dont like You watch or you are nor ready or the time will come . 
What because as they say they can not have them in a crystal box . 
No and also . 
Go exposed . 
Yes also when the children reach certain age Mi son was fifteen  ,  sixteen seventeen years old  .  And he tells me dont worry because you did better than you could do . 
Mhm . 
Ah it is twenty five percent genes and education the rest is the decision the decision of my life . 
Look with that that . 
Of course then I learned Oh wait no eh oh I was and . 
Mm . 
My cellphone was ringing Okay Okay let me answer . 
Okay . 
Eh dont hang up on me because we have to talk for twelve minutes . 
Yes . 
The I only went to turn it off . 
Okay ah . 
And about people I think about movies I love to Watch horror movies . 
OK . 
But there are times when the when when I get scared Im an adult . 
You you scare yourself . 
I get scared and I go find out horror movies . 
Okay okay But your responsibility is to watch it and you yourself scare yourself . 
Yes . 
OK well I dont like them and I dont watch them  .  I dont watch any of that type Thats why its also my decision be even though Im old enough to watch it if its too violent I dont want to watch it . 
Yes Thats why Thats why I respect what my son told me that time Fifty percent is responsibility . 
Yes . 
Of of the individual of the person eh you already did the best you could  ,  but then comes the time for the young people of the past to be eighteen at the . 
That some are much more mature than normal . 
Yes . 
And they starts seeing Rrated movies . 
Mmm . 
At around fourteen and fifteen years old and the PGthirteen  ,  the kids that are eleven and twelve years old are already seeing them . 
Yes there . 
And even sometimes even the little ones And even sometimes the much younger ones because I remember of Jennys little friend who used to watch Harry Potter and its . 
Already thirteen already . 
PG thirteen PG fourteen and then I say that Jenny doesnt like it because she gets scared . 
Yeah . 
She gets scared with the monsters and all that . 
Yes . 
But I am in accordance that the major part is the criteria that you form  ,  and that way in the end take care of them and not let them watch television when they are by themselves . 
Yes because because . 
Dont leave them alone with the tv . 
But imagine the same we cant control them . 
But its the television more then . 
Thats why Im tell you you can control them you cant see this movie because of this and this reason because you need to be more mature or whatever you want to tell them its not true . 
You have to have a formulated criteria to go and see some movies . 
Yes and thats why Im telling you that you dont get nothing out in telling them  ,  you cant see that no  ,  Because there will come a time in which they go to the house like I say to a friends house . 
Aha in the same school they show them movies . 
Or the same school but the same school is under a little more supervision because thats another thing Because becacuase ther is a goal . 
They show them documentals . 
But what I fear the most is when it goes to friends  ,  houses And the have the television right there thats used a lot or the computer or whatever . 
And they have access to the information without the parents  ,  no without tha parents  ,  having any idea at all And they are in the `` piece '' and the parents think they are listening to music or whatever . 
Maybe they are watching something nonadequate Thats why I say I mean if my son or daughter or whoever . 
Is presented to that situation it needs to learn to value itself And learn to answer to that Thats  .  What I say therefore trying trying to give the values of the house . 
Keep going like the superman kid that went up to the window and kill himself . 
My of course because you know they are not ready for that . 
It wanted to fly No I dont want to aks you a question . 
Aha . 
Eh did you read the rules for this game the telephone game . 
Yes OK . 
Um I was wondering ah who is thisare you ready for Christmas already . 
Yes yes yes Im getting ready buying the presnets for the family  .  But now I have I have another things in my mind . 
Of course about your birthday no . 
Yes but Im getting ready buying presents for all the famliy at least for the nieces  ,  I have them ready  ,  weve bought you the presents then there is only the adults left . 
Buy things for the adults an antencion although Ill make most of the presents . 
Thats what I was going to tell you . 
Im going to cook yes ah . 
Cooking and sewing Sewing that thing that you did you gave that to me . 
Yes also for some children too . 
Not that thing in the table . 
Yes the the yes also but I donÂ´t have time yet to wait until middle of until the middle week of December to do it . 
Oh because they are . 
Because I donÂ´t have time before . 
That is beautiful . 
Yes so that is what IÂ´m going to do ThatÂ´s  ,  why IÂ´m going to do some gifts  ,  but for example  ,  um Andreita that is her about to be her birthday soon . 
Two days before Miranda . 
ItÂ´s AndreitaÂ´s birthday too Or three . 
Yes itÂ´s the twenty five or twenty four I donÂ´t remember . 
Oh now I remember it was about three days . 
Three days then from the twenty four So I have a little gift for her I bought her the same as Miranda So uh . 
And what did you buy to Miranda . 
For him I will a screen like those that you draw and then you erase . 
Oh itÂ´s nice . 
Because she likes she already knew them and she likes them  .  She makes little dashes and then she erases them and IÂ´m  ,  not going to give them to her yet because they are very small and she puts them in the mouth . 
But the screen and the pencil yes I will . 
Oh thatÂ´s nice . 
But yes because little things like this . 
What a feeling . 
Sure see the You really enjoy to do that kind of things  ,  then I bought the same to AndreÃ­ta And with that already . 
And do you know who elses birthday . 
Okay who . 
The same date . 
Who . 
Until I remember when I was there . 
My fatherinlaw that . 
Your fatherinlaw yes . 
It is true who . 
The the Juan Luis Sandras younger son . 
Oh yes Okay . 
Also the twenty nine I also remember that more or less in the same date I remember that everybody were there in the same date . 
I dont remember that he was in at least I did not know . 
No you went to the Carlistos birthday and to to the girls . 
I have not gone to any birthday in Sandras house I was to one pure I dont remember really . 
Not you went once you went to Chile and left to her a present that was for her birthday . 
Eh was in April so I went to Chile in April . 
Okay That was other birthday she is three . 
And i left the gift inyes i left the gift in that place . 
Yes for her nephew who came later . 
Of course he came yes he told me that he received it afterwards from her But his name no . 
No but Sandra wont throw a party this year for her birthday . 
No no okay . 
No she said that family only because they will buy something better for the kid so . 
Yes its true . 
She makes really big parties so . 
It gets away from her hands yes . 
She spends too much in that and thats why they can not buy the kid whats he . 
What he really wants yes exactly . 
They have to decide between the two things so this year they decided that only the family . 
So he could get a more special present . 
Of course for a better gift . 
Juan Luis is the big one or the small one . 
The smaller of all . 
Oh yeah . 
And he always says that he doesnt want any clothes . 
Oh poor boy . 
He doesnt want books only toys . 
Carolina . 
Tamara . 
Tamara how are you uh . 
Yes and you . 
Wellwell where are you uh . 
I am in the State of WashingtonSeattle . 
Wow I am in Los Angeles . 
Ah yes . 
Yes it is just incredible . 
Yes . 
Right now I was making a call and suddenly and I did not think today is Sunday  ,  I was half sleep more then awake and I Oh my God . 
Yesyes they get me off guardbut do you have time participating here . 
Yes this is I believe my twenty third call . 
Wow it is almost ready me well just half almost to the tenth . 
Yes and this is the second time I do this service with them . 
Oh Okay okay yes because casualy I received mail from them that they are accepting persons that can participate again in the beganing it was only one time you could participate . 
Yes . 
Nodid you get same mail Right aparently this is going to continue from what you can understand on the mailing they sent . 
Yes I are . 
Rather yeah tell me . 
Then what do you think about what they show in the movies the . 
Tell me Well I am going to tell you honestly  ,  I have more than a year since we stopped seeing movies movies in the regular movies and we switched to the cinema . 
Not too `` conventional '' . 
Aha . 
We switch to movies for example in the case of the movies  ,  no  ,  just like on television  .  Now we see movies kind of documentaries This eh with another kind of message then . 
Aha . 
You watch movies that are in in eh What do you call that Festivals  ?  here there is one for example recently ended the Latin American International Film Festival . 
Eh it was . 
Yeah . 
Hello . 
No I am not here on my computer I am sorry . 
Ah OK This approximately a month or less than a month because since a long time ago  ,  as I tell you we decided we were not going to continue wasting time . 
Time in the majority of the cases really they are movies with a rather  ,  stupid and absurd content and well  ,  and we made the decision well  ,  that we didnt we didnt want to wast either time or money . 
OK . 
Eh watching a type of movies that really dont give you anything . 
Yes because there are lots of movies so I have noticed . 
Yes . 
Yes I like a around here where I live there uste to be one of those ah like Hollywood Video or Blockbuster but it was like . 
Smaller . 
OK . 
And they had movies like the ones theyre talking about documentaries and stuff  ,  but they had to close because since the big stores are around people wont go to these places . 
Sure . 
But those are the best ones I can find movies  .  I like yes my husband is from America but he likes international movies too movies that have more . 
More important things to say . 
Exactly exactly . 
From time to time since I have young children sometimes they want to see some movies and we take them  ,  but usually  ,  no  ,  we have Before we used to go to the movies two or three times a month . 
Yeah . 
But now we reduced it so its once or twice every two months . 
Okay Same here we used to go more or less once a month  ,  we went to the movies very often very and some day we watched a movie so . 
Stupid so dumb that I felt angry at being at the theater  ,  I was thinking what are we doing here what waste of time is this . 
No no no And then we started getting information about other kind of movies and well  ,  we changed completely to that kind of movie Actually right now we are in . 
In one of those phases we are kind of intellectuals  .  Now because we arrived at that point where you feel like . 
What are you doing I mean to watch this I honestly prefer to go to sleep or do something else instead of not all movies there are some that have . 
A different content thats worth watching but lately I feel theyre making movies just for the sake of making them . 
Yeah exactly . 
Its like well he have to make 10 movies Well make then movies it doesnt matter how or when just . 
Making them up as they go along Where are you from . 
Im from panama . 
Ah okay Im from Venezuela . 
Oh Okay . 
Yeah yes . 
Then if it real is real . 
We say that to the `` spot '' no that good  ,  yes  ,  make the movies  ,  how you want  ,  but if some come out good and others if they are not they are not . 
Honestly no And the same is happening right now with the television we had cable  .  And recently in a matter of a month we cut it off because nono dont know all of sudden like . 
That we got against that we see that there was a lot of manipulation in the media  ,  they only give you the news they want and hide what they want . 
Eh then that is a level of news and the movies then yea how no it is not a good money not really very good . 
But they were repeating and repeating and repeating Oh my God  ,  what is this we are paying for this  ,  then is kind a like annoying right now we have kind of annoyed . 
With the means of communication we are like thisyes yes . 
Yes right what you say I am here my husband and I we watch news . 
I believe aja . 
Because every time you see something or they put on something really stupid . 
Exactly . 
Or the do or they exagerate a lot . 
Exactly . 
Because when I was we would be in Panama before Noriega got out of Panama . 
Just imagine . 
And we were overthere and My husband you know that white man white bought paper with my dad is dark and my mom is white and i came out dark like my dad like what . 
When we went out did you know he was American . 
LogicLogic . 
We would go in both we would go in for whatever we had to go  .  He to go to the military base and I had to go with him or something like that . 
Of course . 
And suddenly we got home and we turned the TV on  .  And there were a bunch of stuff going on at Pananama and i looked at him . 
Â¿Hey werent you and i over there this morning i dont remember watching any of that over there . 
Exactly . 
And the next day it was the same and i say Â¡oh what an exagent I think they where showing the things that happened last week and exaggerating like that Â¿what . 
Exactl . 
Since then it got like he doesnt want to believe what the TV says . 
Exactly . 
The news none of that thats what i tell my kids dont believe everything the TV says . 
Exactly . 
Because its not true and this . 
Look incidentally i borrowed a movie thats called the `` the some like `` Panamas deception '' or `` PanamaÂ´s Defense '' . 
Right . 
Thats just when Noriegas problem and everything else we were watching the whole documentary and i was like its cold  ,  because i would never had imagined that it was so sad and so . 
So ugly what happened . 
That was the documentary where they spoke about that men that got his head cut off . 
And oh yeah . 
It isnt it isnt remembered . 
You know i cant remember exactly i dont remember but what i can remember is that night when they bombed and a lot of people died uh even so a few days ago they showed a . 
A recall now during our Presidents visit . 
Aha . 
He was there and the people was protesting that Why the current President did nothing to remember the victims of that sector . 
I think they were named `` Los de Richos '' `` de Chinos '' the sector where practically all the town disappeared and I . 
Oh `` del churillo '' . 
Eh `` Del Chorrillo '' exactly . 
Yes where there was There where the police station was the part of the police station . 
Aha but in that place you say almost happens the same in Venezuela with the current President  ,  There are happening things that you know are happening to us . 
That happened long time ago then those things are put here in Venezuela and happens Idiot the other day I wrote to a reporter from . 
Univision That donÂ´t be so shameless that donÂ´t put those things there that was not the reality the first thing people tell you eh And that President . 
And whatever he is a nuts what happens is that the information is being twisted and he is shown like a monster a dic . 
Tator well a dictator and we have been through four elections and four Referendum  ,  it is not possible more democracy But it is his personality he has a personality that . 
Is uncommon and then people donÂ´t accept that And he is not a common person and people donÂ´t accept that then he is the first critical of all that stuff . 
Yes that . 
And and ah well I donÂ´t know if you have heard him . 
No no because as I tell you I donÂ´t get to much in that news stuff sometimes . 
Of course of course look there is a page on the internet  ,  where you can watch television from all the countries including Panama of course it is called . 
TV four all like TV four all . 
TV . 
Four all . 
Yes Theater . 
Four is a number four . 
Aha . 
TV number four all . 
TV or Tv for all . 
Exactly exactly there you go . 
With . 
It is dot com yes . 
OK . 
There you see the programming of all the channels all the chanels of the world and then of ocurse Panama and Venezuela And then now I now I see the Venezuelan television . 
But specifically I watch the chanel from the government there Because the other channels are from the opposition  ,  then of course it is a little bit more of the same . 
But I like to watch to see what horrific things they are saying . 
OK . 
So I compare and since I have this Internet page  ,  now  ,  I dont turn on the television Now we are stuck with Internet watching channels from . 
The whole world a bit like for comparing what is going on and even we are doing it with radio were listening to community radio that you feel like you ar . 
Are saying truly the truth or at least the other side of the coin lets not say its the truth a hundred per cent because sometimes its not . 
I mean its like I dont know its not that you can say that that everything the others say is not but . 
Aha . 
Good heavens truly they manipulate it too much . 
Yes . 
I dont know if you . 
Say . 
You gave yourself a I dont know if you watched a movie called Auto fox . 
No maybe but I dont remember . 
Its a documentary about those who work in Fox News . 
Mhm . 
And well the practically force them to say what its not and then they decided to resign from the channel and besides resigning  ,  they all got together and the started to protest at a level . 
Well at the level of of eh locally to tell the world  ,  what was going on inside Fox News Its very interesting its called something like . 
`` The Fox Workers that are Out '' . 
Some . 
Something like out of outside . 
Aha . 
And Fox from Fox News . 
My name is . 
Hi my name is Fernanda . 
Hi Fernanda how are you my name is Claudia . 
How are you . 
Where are yo talkingfine Where are yo talking from . 
From Washington . 
Oh which one . 
Washington DC . 
Oh because there are two of them right . 
Yes Washington State . 
Oh and the other one . 
And you where are you from . 
Im talking from Idaho i dont know if you know it . 
Yes of course . 
Yes well personally I dont believe that much about the movies ratings For my point of view  ,  the ratings dont go the way i suppose they would be . 
They dont know how to rate them For example sometimes they said that it is a PG movie but when you watch it and it really . 
Has rude things and pornography and sometimes something stronger like a PG13 is more quiet . 
And doesnt have that many nude scenes or bad language Personally I dont care about those ratings sometimes it just . 
Dont know People who rate those movies dont know how to rate them or I dont know what are their point of view . 
Yes i really dont know that much about movies because . 
Aha . 
Lets say I dont have children or anything like that so I barely ever notice . 
Aha . 
What what classification . 
Aha . 
But I think that the majority of TV there is lets say if you watch during the middle of the day that is when many times children are at home . 
Aha . 
Are things that are not appropriate for most . 
Yes . 
And I think that uhm Americans have no like the mo moral standards have gone down you understand so . 
Yes . 
Many things already are like normal that that I think that they should not be . 
Yes yes it is true because uhm and it is true because uhm oe time  .  Well I dont have cable have the regular channels the ones one can watch . 
Aha . 
But for example I got to have one cable one time and sometimes it was well  ,  which ones  .  Do you like ten am eleven and well I I like to be changing the channel . 
To be well choosing the program I am going to see for that whi for that time . 
Hmjm . 
And sometimes they air movies that boy yes a ten or nine year old  .  Boy was at home and was watching the was changing it too at the same time that I and . 
Stop on that channel there were things like very like very for adults already . 
Sure . 
Then I said uf I said I thought about the children I said well  ,  I I am married  ,  I have been married three years and I have a a boy who is almost two years old . 
OK . 
In any case my son is going to grow up and maybe this is going to get worse Then . 
Of course and . 
Imagine then what kind of cartoons they are going to  ?  well I remember that once I was watching television Look in Mexico I am from Mexico City . 
Mmh . 
It was ten at night exactly ten at night Then I turned on eh  .  I had cable there and I learned the the cable to . 
To the channel that here is sixteen then there was a cartoon in English Because at night they show some in English some in Spanish . 
And there were cartoons in English Then I told him And my mom was well well quiet because he was watching a cartoon channel . 
Well well the cartoons started to show up naked . 
Ah . 
And the cartoon was starting to do things the two cartoon figures  ,  And it was a cartoon  ,  imagine and it was ten at night my mom told me . 
What a horror . 
She turned the television off and well she had to explain a bit  ,  because  ,  well  ,  my mom  ,  she it didnt it surprised  ,  her because I had tuned to a cartoon channel a normal channel . 
Then OK the truth not even cartoons are safe . 
Yes and that could happen lets say to any child who was watching television . 
Sometimes cartoons yes . 
And you can not either be on top of lets say if the kid changes  ,  you can not jump to see or whatever you have to trust that that lets say at least during the day . 
Yes . 
Programming does not contain nudity or curse words or anything like that . 
Yes yes its true But really its not the cartoons  .  Im sorry the Japanese cartoons are are the ones that huh have more classification In MÃ©xico uh . 
Uh tru in CablevisiÃ³n and MultivisiÃ³n that would be what cable here to uh there in MÃ©xico  ,  it hasnt all those restrictions But for example in normal tvs with normal channels . 
Yes it has like more more restrictions Uh not so much now on the other cables and for example In in tvs for example normal of ch childrens channel . 
Of television like any channel the channel for example what is the five in cartoons . 
Yes . 
For example well then at ten of clock eleven and you can watch TV  ,  and they dont put on programs so ugly like that Well . 
In Mexico District mhm . 
Before in MÃ©xico But for example if youre watching a cable channel now you risk the cartoon possibly being something sometimes some kind of . 
Pornography thing or with more nudity . 
I p yes i p look Im Colombian and i think that in Colombia neithe . 
So uh right . 
The TV is a lot better than here in that way . 
Right . 
Because they mig might show lets say at ten pm and the shows they put on are never  .  So you dont youre not at risk Â¿right for them to be as bad as here Here . 
Right . 
Even so here not even at ten neither at ten or at any other hour are you risking to watch anything else . 
Yes thats true fi the other well uh i was with a neighbor and imagine i was with a neighbor it was twelve twelve and a half pm . 
And then her kid was watching uh the a cartoon channel  ,  and after that the girl wanted to change the channel and uh  ,  it was another channel that was also programmed for them for kids . 
Well there has a program were it was were there was a a girl that showed the adventures of a girl and that was in a hospital . 
And suddenly it went right there in the hospital and they were showing how how her mom was having her little brother . 
Ah yes . 
Aha but it showed and I went and told her  ,  her mom of hers and she told me ah theres no problem its a channel of . 
Of of cartoons of that they show a lot of programs And honestly  .  It was it was it didnt it didnt leave much to the imagination  .  I was really like the pose of well it was like an operation room where the woman was having her baby . 
What horror . 
They were they are six years old . 
Yes . 
Because theyre twins she is eh they both are six years old And their mom was letting them see that well each each parent allows to see what . 
What they want But honestly for m if I dont want to explain too much to my children in that moment well honestly I like keep watch more what . 
Well what they see no in that aspect But uff . 
Yes imagine when lets say there are there are babysitters and things like that that you dont have control and youre not in the house to see . 
Mm aha . 
You dont know what theyre watching that they go to their friends or whatever . 
Yes no . 
I think . 
Yes its one of those really those classifications that they have And n and n mainly for television They truth now now n . 
They dont leave anything to the mi to the imagination they show it right away . 
Yes . 
Now at any time of the day and you go and watch soap operas I dont like watching soap operas But you see . 
Many mo moms are at home and they have little children  ,  three four years old  ,  five or more or theyre at home and they watch theyre watching their soap opera . 
And theyre al always show scenes where they are the the couple theyre there having relations . 
Hmm . 
And in the middle of the day because the soap operas later are on from six in the morning until nightfall . 
Of course . 
And thats how they are So now they dont leave anything to the imagination . 
No I . 
So the programs are classified to see a scene of pornography on the television at anytime of the day is normal And for many . 
Parents unfortunately are making it normal . 
Exactly . 
And I believe that that if the parents spoke to this television station and said that or demand that that were more strict programs to to privacies of scenes of this type of scenes . 
I believe that they would decrease a little But anyways not now or until parents if their children see something like that its okay its no problem . 
It doesnt matter to them hmm . 
Teaching And so these things of classifications I dont like And I believe it doesnt matter to the producers BeI feel that to them its beneficial because . 
If a movie has some sex scene or has crudeness for the people  .  They buy it or the people see it and they even sthey laugh . 
Or sometimes it even calls their attention because it has a very strong scene So really these these things sometimes even help more . 
Producers to sell . 
Sometimes and . 
If thats the case no Uh for me in particular  ,  the type of movies that I like in truth I really like Disney movies the . 
Childrens movies I like them . 
Yes yes yes . 
Even though I I am tired and I love all of this  .  I have some Disney movie around here Sincerely I do not like the movies . 
Strong so that that have many things of of sex and all that  ,  because equally  ,  I repeat to you that I am going to have more kids and while I am not going to be and . 
And at least that if they are going to put on a movie  ?  well that it is at least a decent movie That it does not have so many things . 
Of course of course . 
That is so that while we have those from Disney  ,  at least they are going to be have pornography right Then/Well . 
Yes he/she does not know how they are going to change . 
No no yes then already this is the truth this is bringing the truth  ,  far as it already goes  ,  you  ,  turn on the television and if you you already see a commercial . 
Of feminine towels and it seems fine/well until almost almost they are goint to explain to you how while they are going to put a naked woman and they are going toyou . 
Put there how she is placing the towel . 
Exactly . 
Because sometimes until they show it to you I dont know  ,  if you have seen the commercials that ugh Likewise/Equally it frightens you because you are big right but . 
But if a boy or a girl is seeing it for example  ,  and yoiu say  ,  if it is the mom and you can answer well  ,  fine  ,  and if it is the friend ( boy or girl ) . 
And you tell them and can explain to him/her the bad information then . 
And that one becomes acostomed to it do you understand me We say . 
Then already yes . 
So that sometimes I see and like that one does not realize how they have changed things . 
Good Evening my name is Mariza from Philadelphia . 
Hello Hello mi name is Juan you are Marisol . 
Mariza Mariza . 
I see Mariza we talked a few days ago I think no . 
Oh chin maybe yes . 
I could be I am in San Antonio Texas . 
In San Antonio yes . 
Listen the theme for today is about religion no . 
Yes that is a complicated and very controversial theme . 
Well exactly like the need of religion is something that we all have I think . 
Mhm . 
And this is like any other need the institution tried of . 
Yes . 
Give us answer And ends been like a way to control no . 
Ah yes really today in this country Eh In the United States  .  There is a lot lot of problems regarding religion it is a mix with politics and lot of right side people that want to have control . 
Tried to control the country in base of religion also and it can be positive  ,  or it can be negative to many people it help to pray or believe help in others in others of others . 
In other way the the the Christians is the most powerful religion in the world  .  And there a more lets say that have power to have influence in politicians to the countries . 
Yes lets see in this case for example here where I live I went to a church . 
Mhm . 
That they express a project of ideology but regarding a conservative group in the United States no . 
Hmm yeah . 
Then they exerted a power very very direct very sure trying to influence people there at the church . 
Yeah . 
With the discourse it came to my attention against the public schools . 
Aham . 
Directly against the public schools and praying for God to free us from public school some day . 
Really . 
Because yes . 
Oh oh no . 
And against the theory about trying to see the theory of evolution no . 
Oh Ive heard that yes . 
No terrible they said Why is this excruciating the teachers that teach the Bible to explain the creation of the world . 
Exactly yeah there are a lot of problems yeah . 
Well Im getting carried what I say is that reasonably the Bible doesnt make for a explanation of the world . 
No everyone can believe what they want what it is is that they try to impose their beliefs to everyone and for the Bible for what they think . 
Exactly theyre fundamentalisms no . 
Yeah fundamentalism yes yes yes from the right wing But also the country is ah the party has the power so everyone from the president to everyone who is into this at the White House theyre all rightwing republicans . 
Target of uh Christians and they are the ones that The people with power in the country  .  The ones with the companies everyone is maybe there are a lot of rightwing republican fundamentalists who want to take the law away . 
The right to abort the right of for example another question was homosexuality gay marriage the right to the belief of . 
Yes more scientific no no you cant just believe what they say they say  ,  God  ,  created man  ,  and woman  ,  you also have to give a choice for kids to believe . 
That was Charles Darwin who came up with the theory of evolution And . 
Yes . 
And its really complicated too about the other question was about homosexuality  ?  yes yea If we were all equal or we all believed the same thing there wouldnt be any problems I was asking . 
But . 
Well I think that maybe as similar as we are more problems no . 
Yes . 
In that sense the differences help to complement each other . 
Right for me I dont have any . 
The subject the subject of homosexuality is very controversial . 
Mhm . 
But at any given time its not a like lets  ,  go like tolerance of the phenomenon of homosexuality has to be something like that that were well informed about no I for example used to think that . 
It could have something to do with a deviation homosexuality  ,  but lately Ive read that its a matter of of genetics . 
Yes I Im convinced its that because I know a lot of people that are . 
No . 
Uh well homosexuals or lesbians and Im really informed and so thats why yea I never know because Ever since I was since I was a girl well . 
Like I would accept people for I never thought they were better or worse for being homosexual  ,  and that everyone has the right to to well I dont know well to get married to . 
Well yes . 
To be with whoever they want Its the same if its a man or a woman to me it matters  .  It doesnt matter to me and I think that we all have the same rights because were all citizens and they pay the same taxes . 
Yes . 
They have to have the right to get married to live with whoever . 
Yes yes I agree with you exactly I think that they have all the rights because we can have any other type of person and in this cases the marriage rights are relatives . 
Well many drive the homosexuality question as a very wicked situation and they dont have rights to marriage no really when marriage is really a contract . 
Mhm . 
Between two persons that stated doing something in comun . 
Right but the church wont see it that way . 
No . 
Believe that it is an abomination because marriage is define as the union between a woman & a man and believe and the people & christian fundamentalist like I said before they see it as an abomination and they are so closed mind that they dont understand that . 
That was before the tradicional thinking but now times have change and each one also Same as before homosexuality has been always since the beginning of man but before was a way and now is . 
I dont know thinks are more liberal lets say people isnt scare to talk like I am homosexual or I am gay or I am whatever . 
That is the problem The Church has a problem but they can not do anything . 
Aha . 
People is accepting the echo from people yes like he is homosexual yes and well . 
Right yes like there is one that is so exreme eh the family and marrige the eclesiastic institution and the blessing of God for marriage and things when in reality . 
Well the church and religion is a way of institution like school have . 
Right . 
The need to change and find new ways to learn thing of life . 
Yes . 
From society and individuals no . 
Yes the religion has to be something personal no something that mix with politics  .  Each one can the think what you believe is each one doesnt have to be what . 
Eh lets see why you dont think the same as me  ,  you are no me  ,  well  ,  like you get punish  ,  because we are diffent and shouldnt be that each person can think whatever they want believe in anything or anyone dont have . 
For the christians because they talk badly about the Muslims because they say they are radicals  ,  or they talk badly about the atheist because they dont believein god and they call them heretic or . 
But I dont know . 
Right . 
That is very christian you have to accept the people like they are and each and everyone one of them that believes or has your religion  ,  but that is the problem with the fundamentalists that they dont accept the differences . 
Yes well but in that case accepting the difference seems like something that has to do with the matter of humanity right . 
Mm . 
Like one paradox not be able to accept the difference they think but right . 
What happens is that yes because in this country the kids when the families  ,  the christian families that righties say that they raise their children in a manner that when they are very little  ,  they teach them to be like that and thats how it is so . 
When they are older and know that people are different  ?  well they say no that is not right because they taught me like that and that is how they have to be . 
You know they are very radicals no they dont accept differences because they were raised in a manner that their parents taught them so . 
Yes . 
And for example I had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of different races cultures so I am very open to everything . 
Right . 
And so when I see a person who is not  .  And so I immediately know only by looking at them  .  I say this person will not accept me because Im  ,  not like them  .  I am not I dont think the same I dont look the same . 
But is that there are classes there are mu people of different classes and well  ,  there has to be radicals  ,  Christians  ,  there has to be everything  .  But I think that yes religion does influence the country yes . 
Eh yes influences a lot what fascinates me is that in this case . 
Yes . 
In this country being so fundamentalist right . 
Yes I am . 
With the churches there is a great proportion of fundamentalist  ,  even in the discourse of the president himself there are fundamentalists . 
Of course yes yes yes . 
Not there . 
The message is very clear and its already been five years in government and when Bill Clinton was in government  ,  he was not  ,  so he was more open lets  ,  say of course he was a leftist more ope a person more . 
That understood more peoples concerns and this government lets say that they dont have the Well  ,  that the the religious Christians of the right that is the ones that are . 
Saying how to do things in the country and thats  ?  why there is such a polemic with marriages also there is with the with the supreme court with with the judges that they want them to be from the right also and that they are religious well they . 
To be or Catholic or that they are also they want that that they take away  .  The right to abortion and things like that that is is ridiculous at this stage of the century . 
Aha . 
That like that they want that things go backwards that they go back  .  Instead of going forward they want that things become as they were thirty or forty years ago and that can not be . 
But thats how we are now . 
Aha and do you practice any religion in particular . 
I in my family are from in Spain Im Cat  ,  Catholicism lets say its as soon as youre born  ,  they baptize you  ,  first communion and all that so I got married in the Church . 
Sure . 
I believe well I have my beliefs but I dont go to church to mass every  .  Sunday neither do I practice you know I dont practice I am I believe . 
But lets say that I carry it on my own lets say that I carry faith with me I dont . 
Yes . 
Neither neither am I I mean I am very open  .  I mean its like contradictory that I am a believer  ,  I am Catholic but no you know I am not funda nothing . 
Yes The same with me and when sometimes I get closer with the Catholic church  ,  it is almost temporary because they are they say  ,  listen  ,  where there is a feeling of integration of community there is . 
Created interests in everyone it seems . 
Yes yes yes there is much economic interest yes . 
No then . 
That is the problem it is that it goes right away that they are not interested on the followers they are interested on money and . 
Yes . 
And also they dont look like such believers either there have been many cases of of child abuse and things like that of child abuse . 
Which you hear and you question and how can this be possible That a a priest do that to a child There is much polemic regarding that . 
Yes . 
But Lets say faith it is each one I dont know that each person is free to believe what he wants and practice it but respecting others who are not the same . 
Aha . 
Because there are many religions and what happens is that the Christian religion is the most lets say abundant in the world  .  It is the more the one that has the power on everything . 
Because in the world we have on this side of the world  .  No because I believe that I only believe that not even the majority of Christians I believe there are more Muslims than Christians . 
Yes but they dont have as much economic power that is the problem . 
Mmh . 
Hi good night . 
Yes good night . 
Good night My name is Carolina .

The most essential and above all eh and new techniques  .  No new technologies that have come and every day more new things come up no . 
Yes . 
So the truth is that I have adapted very well and I love it since Ive been using the computer because well before I used a type writer that was so slow to . 
Write documents and forms and everything now everything is done through the computer and the Internet no I mean its something amazing . 
For me its essential I think that I wouldnt know what to do without computers  ?  no So the truth is that Im very happy with this new technology and I hope it keeps going . 
Forward more every day no . 
Mm of course I believe that they have e they have made more a advancements in the computer that they have mane in with medicine . 
Thats true . 
The computer is the most advanced of civilization now . 
Aha yes and for everything no I mean its all one . 
Yes . 
Want you find it there and well when one sits down in front of well  ,  i use it for my work but well also when Im at home and I need . 
Some information well I sit down in front of the computer and theres no  ,  stopping me  ,  I dont know when its like with something an essential part of ones life no . 
Yes exactly . 
For everything because if you need to know what the temperature is outside well you go to the computer . 
News sports . 
Before it was yes mhm . 
Oh going out with women of everything . 
Yesyesyes . 
No and even that survey that we are making now I found it by the computer also . 
Oh also yes oh . 
Yes almost mm then the computer has a lot of influence . 
Okright and how many calls you made . 
In our lifes twentytwothis is my hm twentysecond call . 
Oh and hmyou are finished then . 
I almost need about three but one call that the person spoke more in englishI think is going to have a replacement . 
Oh now now . 
Bu but who knows . 
Nowmhm . 
Because I spoke in spanish then they should consider . 
Mhm now . 
Because if you speak in englishthey do not count it . 
But they give you the payment after you finish the twentyfive calls no . 
Yesyou do one call to replace . 
Yesonownow mhh . 
I went to speak to him I know the owner of this . 
Oh yes . 
And and I am going to ask if it will be on me to replace it . 
Oh ehm do you know the owner . 
Yes . 
Oh that is great . 
Yes it is easy it is easy to speak with him . 
Oh is he from is he from there from California . 
No he must be in Philadelphia . 
Oh I see I see I see . 
But but he gave me his ph . 
Oh but do you know him personally . 
No no no no . 
Oh just through the computer . 
Yes I know him through the computer but he . 
Through the internet I see aha . 
But he he talks with people that are participating . 
Oh I see ehm yes Oh no I never have speak with him I . 
Yes then if you have any questions you can him he is Chinese . 
Oh yes . 
Yes wel I dont know if he is the owner he is . 
Oh . 
Him the manager . 
Yes . 
Yes that for supervisor of the project they are doing . 
Ok ok OK . 
Yes they are studying the way we talk Spanish . 
Ok right and . 
Dont know you heard that . 
Yeas yes i did and i think that they will start another one after they finish this one . 
No i dont know most probably they do because i i already did two . 
Mhm . 
On in English and another in Spanish . 
Oh so this is the second oh yes . 
Yes and what were doing right now is technology . 
Oh oh . 
Because they are doing phone line connections . 
Yeah right ah and the other was almost equal twenty five calls . 
And this is technology yes something like that was the same thing but in English . 
Right and they payed you too equal . 
Yeah they paid the same . 
Oh ok OK . 
Yes I like to do this not only for the payment but for the opportunity given to me . 
Ah good . 
To speak in Spanish . 
Of course . 
Because it is the t the only time in the day that I speak Spanish . 
Mm yes . 
I I speak very little Spanish now most of my day is English . 
Oh yeah right . 
Yes . 
Yes . 
And what . 
Goo Yes of course it is . 
This could not be done for about twenty thirty years what we are doing now . 
Exactly yes . 
Because they are using multiple telephone lines to connect many people living in different parts of the country . 
Exactly . 
I think phone technology has made progress because I can also make long distance phone calls and I do not have to pay . 
Ah a monthly fee . 
Yeah . 
And you can make all the calls you want . 
Oh but here in . 
And that wasnt that wasnt like that in five or ten twenty years . 
Ofcourse but here in the United States . 
Here in the United States yes . 
Oh ya ofcourse yes yes justifiably I have just received ah from Verizon that they are offering me free calls here in the United States . 
Yes . 
And they give me and in the meantime they charge me . 
If they charge you something monthly but if you make a lot of calls its worthwhile . 
Yes ofcourse . 
And you know what Some day they will make it international also for your favorite country . 
Ah how good it was . 
You pay a monthly quote and you can make the calls you want . 
Ya yes . 
Yes . 
How great it would be No it would be excellent for calling the country when one wants  ,  I think it will be like that but with the cards also no every day . 
Before it was pricey Remember before For calling the country of . 
And it is cheaper right . 
Now it is very cheap of course . 
And why is it cheap Because of technology . 
That ofcourse yes of course yes . 
Yes technology . 
Now you can talk three four or five hours for five dollars . 
Exactly . 
Before it was one minute oh my god it was like eight . 
One minute was twenty cents yes . 
And yes I remember that I had to talk I think that just ten minutes was it cost me like twentyfive dollars . 
Mm . 
And I had to be careful a lot have the clock in front of me no . 
Yes yes yes that has happened to me too . 
Yes aha . 
That yes yes yes ah I know that yes what it is you have to be with the clock . 
Aha Of course Ah yes . 
Yes but eh with with . 
Yes I have the truth is that hopefully technology continues  .  Moving ahead I say that here in about ten years what are they going to come up with no . 
Because like this has to be moving forward no . 
What happens is that like it is advancing and technology is in the hands of of more people . 
Mmh Mmh . 
Then services are cheaper because they sell to more people . 
Na Sure yes . 
Do you understand . 
Mhm of course . 
Eh for example the computer the computer a few years ago was worth one or two thousand dollars . 
Exactly yeah . 
Now you can buy a computer for two hundred or three hundred dollars . 
Yeah thats true ha . 
Because theres more demand . 
Of course of course ha . 
Because technology has adavanced . 
Of course thats true . 
What i would like to see is . 
Yeah . 
More advanced technology with medicine . 
Mm . 
They have to find cures for things like cancer if you can go to the moon  ,  why cant they find a cure for cancer it could be they could make a . 
True . 
Fast computer that can think why cant they find a cure for cancer . 
Mm mm . 
I want to see more advances in medicine i think their going slow in that area . 
Mm yeah . 
I havent really seen so many advances in diseases in the past 10203040 years . 
Mm Mm . 
Goo . 
Its true because of the cancer and how many years it has . 
Yes it kills many people right . 
And we did not find the cure right And he is right . 
Right That shortens the lives of many people . 
A yes yes yes . 
Or or heart disease as well . 
Mhm AIDS now that it is so widespread across many sites . 
AIDS is more advanced than cancer in in . 
Well thats if . 
In the sense of control because you have to have the drugs to fight it . 
Yes yes . 
But the cancer is very slow I think . 
Mm yeah . 
Youve heard of a discovery for cancer . 
No no no its not true . 
I nothing Nothing . 
Aha . 
Very slow . 
Yes . 
That could be improved . 
Well well . 
Yes . 
I hope right I hope that comes out that that God may enlighten them so they can find something that could cure for this  .  This catastrophe that is when cancer comes it does not matter the age but it comes right . 
Yes yes . 
It can happen to any person . 
I I had a friend that died very young at thirtytwo years of age and got cancer from one day to another . 
Yes yeah . 
And she died in three days . 
Oh my God In three days oh . 
Yes because she got cerebral bleeding . 
Oh my God . 
And and she died immediately she had luki leukemia of the blood . 
Oh yea . 
And of that she got it from one day to the next . 
Oh my God . 
Mhm And there was nothing they could do no . 
Mm . 
I dont know no uh .
