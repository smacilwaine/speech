Aye ,  look ,  I'm in New York . 
And you  Ah .   I didn't know that the study included people so far ,  but how nice . 
yes ,  I participated in a study like this ,  em ,  like a year ago .   And , 
Ah ,  ah ,  hmm ,  my son participated in this ,  yes . 
yes .   I knew that it was ,  in the whole country .   Like ,  people from the whole country . 
Aha .   yes .   And where are you from ? 
New York ,  em ,  well ,  I was born here in New York . 
Ah . 
But ,  my famil 
But from Hispanic parents . 
sure ,  sure . 
Ah .  Very good . 
And you ,  what country are you from ? 
I'm I'm Cuban . 
Ah ,  look .  My father is Cuban . 
Ah ,  how nice . 
What ,  from what part of Cuba are you ? 
From ,  from La Havana . 
Ah .  And from which ,  which neighborhood ? 
From Miramar .  And him ? 
Mm .  He's from the Vibora . 
Ah ,  my grandparents lived in the Vibora . 
Aha . 
Look
he came when he was little .  But ,  I mean ,  not so little ,  but like at ,  at eleven years old .  But , 
Aha ,  I came when I was nine . 
Mm . 
Aha .  Well ,  they tell us we have to talk about marriage . 
Of marriage ,  but I don't know what thing about marriage . 
Well ,  look ,  that eh ,  Your parents ,  how long have they been married ? 
Eh ,  lets see ,  my parents just celebrated thirty seven years of marriage . 
Oh ,  well ,  that's nice . 
Thirty seven years . 
Oh ,  that's a lot ,  that's nice . 
Are you married ? 
No ,  I used to be but I got divorced about ten years ago .  What about you ? 
No ,  I'm not ,  I'm single ,  so far . 
Am ,  my children are single too .  The older one is twenty three years old and I've got two who are still in the university . 
Mm .  Sure ,  well ,  they are still young
yes ,  they are young ,  yes
Em , 
yes ,  what do you think about the changes that have taken place in the marriage institution over the past twenty to thirty years ?  They want us to speak about marriages . 
Changes in marriage ?  Well ,  I believe that ,  in general ,  they've been ,  I mean ,  they've been ,  oh ,  it has improved .  Eh , 
well ,  yes no ,  who knows .  The ,  the ,  I mean ,  in the past ,  marriage were like fixed ,  you had to ,  marry a guy with money ,  or with ,  the
the one your parents had chosen for you . 
yes . 
It's different now ,  you have a lot of options .  I believe that in general ,  the changes are for the better .  You now have bigger divorce rates too ,  I mean ,  I believe that when  you have several options
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
when people are able to choose ,  that causes more ,  I mean ,  you can have more problems eh ,  you can see it ,  I mean ,  maybe ,  people in the past were very , 
em ,  they were in bad marriages but they stayed together because that was their only option . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes .   Yes and they hid a lot of what happened because ,  it ,  it wasn't considered right to talk about it . 
Sure .   Sur ,  like ,  I think that the topic of
And , 
lovers and ,  eh ,  of unfaithful people ,  and uh ,  discussions yes ,  all this ,  well ,  has always existed , 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
and always ,  and ,  and what I think ,  it will always exist .   But since people couldn't get divorced before , 
yes . 
they stayed together . 
Hmm ,  hmm ,  hmm
Em , 
yes ,  yes .   Something one can think is ,  well ,  women are better or worse because one ,  one can say both things , 
Hmm . 
one can say that they're better ,  in the sense that there are many things that ,  that maybe our grandmothers put up with from our grandfathers
Hmm . 
that no modern woman puts up with today . 
Sure . 
Eh ,  on the other and ,  also ,  they divorce and are left alone screaming at the kids . 
Sure ,  sure .   And maybe ,  I don't know in other countries ,  but here ,  maybe ,  sometimes the women are really lonely ,  em ,  caring for the kids .   Like ,  even the community ,  or ,  the relatives ,  sometimes there isn't much support from other people . 
yes ,  yes ,  no ,  no ,  no .   Once 
I think that in the old days there was a lot more
hmm . 
connection between family and between the community .   So that if you
yes . 
have a problem ,  in the sense that I don't know ,  the husband left or died ,  the woman would have ,  in that era ,  more
yes . 
support .   But now , 
Exactly ,  yes . 
it's more like you're alone ,  and you have to defend yourself like ,  like you can
yes .   yes ,  yes .   yes ,  exactly ,  and I also see that the way of life in the United States contributes ,  in the sense that ,  en ,  I think that ,  that ,  hmm
boys get to a certain age ,  and they want to live on the other side . 
Sure . 
Of ,  I don't think that ,  I live in Philadelphia ,  which is a city where there's all kinds of jobs .   You can't say ,  well ,  it's a town
Hmm
and ,  and ,  and there are few jobs and you have to go out to loo  to earn a living . 
Hmm .   Hmm . 
And in spite of this ,  I don't think that any of my three kids will stay here . 
Hmm . 
Eh ,  this ,  well ,  I've already been here for several years ,  I want to go and explore another place . 
Hmm . 
And ,  this contributes in a way to divorce because they're not close to the families anymore . 
Hmm .   Sure .   Sure ,  like it's a very individualistic culture .   I think that ,  like ,  for better or for worse ,  people here have a mentality of
like like ,  life and the decisions are one . 
yes . 
And the family can give advice but really ,  the family can't ,  won't influence as much as in other places where you li 
yes . 
feel close or have to worry more ,  or have to do what the family says ,  what the family wants for you . 
Hmm ,  hmm . 
Em ,  here it's different .   Like ,  I lived in Chile for two years ,  and when I told the Chileans who , 
who in New York ,  or my friends when ,  went to live alone when they were twenty , 
Hmm ,  hmm . 
em ,  people ,  looked and me and said ,  look ,  you have a good family .   Why did you leave home to live alone ?  Like ,  she didn't go to live with a boyfriend ,  to live
yes . 
alone .   Like for them it's crazy to do something like this . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes .   yes . 
And hmm ,  I don't know ,  it was difficult to explain because it's a difference in mentality ,  I think . 
yes ,  yes ,  it's a difference in mentality and where ,  and where the person goes wrong is when a situation happens that leaves you very alone
Hmm . 
or a bigger weight than you can really tolerate . 
Hmm ,  sure . 
And ,  and so you live really far from the family . 
Sure .   Sure .   Sure ,  or also ,  like ,  I think that it also influ  hmm ,  like ,  eh ,  creates a sensation of ,  of isolation ,  like that one is like
isolated from , 
Isolated ,  yes ,  aha . 
sure ,  from ,  from the others ,  or I don't like .   Like ,  from ,  hmm ,  well ,  like on the one hand it's also ,  there are good things ,  good for this as well .   Like there are people who feel free to do
the things they want to do .   And ,  and many times the family pressure can cause problems .   Like ,  you , 
yes ,  yes . 
you can  can't get married to the person you really love because your family says no .   Like , 
yes ,  yes . 
But ,  but there's always a cost .   Like ,  there's always a ,  a ,  the good and the bad always go together .   Like ,  on the one hand good ,  on the other ,  bad . 
Exactly ,  yes yes yes .   yes ,  yes .   One thing ,  now that ,  now that we're talking about marriage and the Latin life , 
Hmm . 
I've never seen if there's a difference between the divorce rate of Latinos in the United States ,  and non Latinos . 
Hmm .   I don't know .   I don't know .   Like ,  live ,  the Latinos living here in the United States , 
yes ,  the Latinos living here . 
aye ,  I don't know .   This I don't know .   Eh ,  it's difficult
Because ,  at the beginning ,  I thought that ,  that between Latinos ,  mostly the recently arrived ,  that they would have a lower divorce rate . 
It could be .   It could be .   Especially recently arrived ,  because they need a lot ,  to support each other . 
yes . 
They really need to be ,  to be together in this ,  in this fight .   Because ,  really ,  it's a ,  it's a drastic change . 
Hello

yes not Mexicans ,  the Mexican population is incredible here in the United States . 
When I had just arrived here almost five years ago ,  you almost didn't see anyone Hispanic . 
Yes
But the ,  in ,  the ,  in the last year
Uh um
this has been getting filled with ,  with mexi ,  with a lot of mexicans ,  there is a lot of Mexicans right now . 
wow ,  wow
Uh um
Well ,  and ,  and you understood well ,  because this boy was talking ,  he was a whit  ,  an American speaking spanish ,  i didn't understand the subject ,  i understood something about marriage ,  but i didn't ,  didn't ,  i didn't
didn't hear it very clear
I didn't hear the subject very clear either ,  no
Yes
I was the same ,  i was going to ask that ,  I'm the same
Yes ,  yes ,  no ,  this line they formed has a lot of trouble ,  i have to send them an e mail tomorrow ,  because this is the second time i work with them and
Right
they're very ,  they try ,  you know ,  they want to find out what's going on and be ,  uh ,  do studies ,  etc .  but the line they made this time ,  they really didn't do it right ,  because
the first thing since you put your code where they thank you ,  a lot of time goes by
Yes
So ,  i'l write to them tomorrow
Oh ,  that's ,  that's good ,  i was in the ,  i was in the other program in which English was spoken  too ,  so
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  me too ,  uh ,  i was in that ,  and that ,  that was better ,  well ,  also because it was only six minutes .  I really thought about it for long before getting into this ,  because oh man . 
Yes
Talking 10 minutes ,  you have to make an effort ,  my wife can talk 10 minutes easily ,  but I can't ,  you run out of
yes
the topic
yes ,  yes ,  yes
so
I don't really now much about ,  how is it said ? 
And development of the study and everything
yes ,  they make studies and they told you the percentages that they are interested and everything ,  the other one ,  etc ,  so ,  I heard something about he said about marriage and I didn't understand clearly what they were talking about
yes
So ,  we were talking about marriage ,  and well ,  if you are single ,  if you are married ,  so ,  they take into account those details and they said that
three thousand calls they got ,  50% was married or not divorce ,  etc ,  so I don't really now ,  are you married ? 
yes ,  I'm married
Oh nice ,  and family ?  ,  kids ? 
yes ,  I have 2 kids and I've married 5 years and half now
Oh ,  that's nice ,  I almost the same ,  I have a children ,  like two years and a half
Oh ,  okay ,  and the oldest is 4 years old and the youngest a year old
oh nice ,  really nice and the one year older ,  does he sleep good at night ? 
yes ,  he sleeps all night
Oh ,  nice ,  really nice
From a while now ,  he sleeps all night
Yes ,  that's great ,  how great we we found a little secret
yes
that the children ,  out little girl is a ball of smoke
to ,  yes
sincerely ,  but sleep lasts all the night ,  but she got out of bed a little bit early
aha
Me at six thirty ,  I have given this advice to a lot of people and they have been very grateful you wouldn't believe
okay
eh ,  at six thirty in the morning sleeping ,  defeated I give a little bit of warm milk
aha
she takes it with eyes closed and continue sleeping until about eight thirty almost to nine . 
ah ,  yes
yes
oh ,  wow
yep ,  yep ,  so she sleeps almost for eleven hours . 
ah wow ,  that's quite a bit
yeah ,  so that you know ,  my husband is happy because she can ,  she does her nails ,  and does her hair ,  you know that I'm also very chill ,  Saturday and Sunday are the best ,  because at least one of them
rests a little bit more ,  no
yes ,  yes
already ,  so if you haven't tried that ,  I tell you ,  I'd advise you to do that because it works very well ,  it's that the milk
I will have to try
They say that milk has a ,  a chemical ,  ¿right ?  ,  that helps ,  to ,  to sleep so ,  when you can't sleep well ,  you drink a glass of warm milk . 
Yes
So ,  that's what i do ,  it's been like nine months that ,  we are doing that ,  and she sleeps divine .  But i think that one of these days that's going to end ,  you know . 
I am going to have ,  i am going to have to try to ,  to use that trick ,  because mine gets up at six and a half in the morning
Yeah ,  because their tank is empty
Yes
No because they have ,  so many hours since you gave him the last milk and well ,  at his age ,  he still has trouble with teeth too ,  ¿right ? 
Yes ,  yes ,  he
yes ,  his little teeth are still coming out ,  so so ,  but well ,  but when the teeth thing is over ,  or ,  well ,  maybe from now on too
Uh um
I'm telling you that's worked for us ,  that's worked ,  we thank God very much because the girl is really like a smoke ball
Wow
i don't know ,  to ,  ¿right ?  ,  we take her to the park to run ,  to get plenty tired
Yes
because if not ,  forget it ,  it's ,  it's ,  it's incredible the energy this little rascal has
yeah ,  oh ,  at that age
right ,  right
wait until she's three and a half
uh um
it is worse ,  when they are three and a half years old ,  they speak fine already . 
yes ,  yes
so
yes ,  she's pretty ahead ,  she speaks a lot ,  she was telling us the ABC in English yesterday and
oh ,  that's good
yes ,  she ,  these girls ,  they are so mature ,  they are growing up faster . 
yes ,  that's right ,  mhm
so ,  they say ,  so ,  so ,  she's talking now . 
wow ,  that's good ,  you have to keep teaching her ,  read to her
yes ,  yes
my children read a lot ,  the one that is four years old can now read
yes ,  that's right ,  yes ,  yes
he can almost read ,  this
that's good ,  that's nice ,  we do read to them often ,  we have a book that teaches them the first thousand words in Spanish and it has pictures . 
ah
so ,  Elena says ,  what's this ?  and the book says ,  its a bus .  And what's this ,  this is a car ,  this is the kitchen ,  this is a towel . 
ah
no ,  she does understand and she's repeating it little by little
ah ,  that's good ,  yes
I only speak to her in Spanish and my wife speaks to her in English ,  I only speak to her in Spanish . 
oh
yes ,  she does understand ,  when I tell her ,  Elena come here ,  Elena come up here ,  Elena ,  it's time to sleep ,  and so on ,  so on ,  so on
yes ,  mine ,  mine is not that good in Spanish because he's father only speaks English . 
So ,  aha
so ,  it's hard
yes , 
to try to balance it ,  but ,  but ,  we're trying . 
yes
we're getting there ,  my whole family only speaks Spanish . 
sure ,  sure ,  sure
So
So ,  you are all alone here with your husband ,  you don't have your family close to you
but he's ,  lets say ,  it's like I don't have a family because he's in the Navy
oh ,  okay
So ,  that's why we are here ,  but ,  we are moving to Virginia in about a month and a half
Where are you going ,  to Virginia ? 
mhm
Ah ,  that's good ,  ah ,  you are going to like it ,   you have been there before ,  haven't you ? 
No ,  I've never been to Virginia ,  I haven't . 
You haven't ?  You're going to like it ,  Virginia is so pretty and it's not that far away from the beach ,  just a bit ,  not that far away from the beach and
the ambience is peaceful as it should be ,  I imagine in Washington ,  is peaceful
yes ,  ha
And well it's only like three or four hours from New York
yes ,  yes
So , 
ah yes ,  that's what we are the happiest about that we are close to everything really . 
Right ,  right ,  yes
because this here ,  better said this is like ,  super boring
yes
there's not much to do ,  almost everything oh go out ,  or go out you know to ride ,  or climb mountains ,  or everything more than anything nature stuff ,  there's not much diversity ,  you understand ? 
Right ,  right

Oh ,  i have a few friends ,  yeah ,  they're cops
Yeah ,  i have ,  i have ,  most of my family is there ,  around where you are
Yeah
I am the only one over here .  My sister was here ,  but she moved ,  she got married and moved over ,  to
Connecticut ,  i am lonely for now ,  with my family over here . 
Yes
Uh um ,  ¿and when will you go there ,  to your country again ? 
I have never gone ,  ever
Oh ,  i mean ,  yeah ,  born here
Yes
Oh ,  no .  I was born in Panama ,  and I've been already ,  fourteen years I'm here in the United States
I've never gone there ,  and besides ,  it doesn't interest me to go there . 
Ah
No ,  because the family ,  I don't like to be with the family ,  like there
Oh
because they talk about one another ,  like
Oh , 
and to me ,  I don't like this
Listen ,  and I say ,  your family must be related to my family because it's the same with mine over there
Yes
When I went to visit ,  because I went when ,  when my fahter died ,  I went there .  And since I went in a rush ,  it was like how ,  Panama had changed a lot since I left ,  because I left before Noriega . 
yes . 
So then things were bad when I left .  So then when I got there ,  I arrived and grabbed the first hotel that I wanted ,  that ,  that I saw .  it cost like fifty five dollars a night ,  and that was that . 
My family ,  "oh that's ,  what are you spending" and I say ,  "oh ,  my God ,  rewind to my father , " mm ,  the funeral ,  and here they are fighting over how much I'm ,  paying for hotel
so then
Yes ,  it's like that here ,  when they come to visit here ,  the house where
good ,  good evening
how are you ? 
good thanks ,  my name is Carmen from Chicago .  And you ? 
I'm Janis from Nebraska
Okay
And I didn't hear too well what we had to talk about
of marriage ,  aha
oh of marriage oh okay ah well I think that in this time ,  in these days these years it's very hard to be married
because
yes is a lot of work
a lot of work and for many more years
yes ,  well I
how long have you been married ? 
I've only been married two years
ah I've been married thirty aha
thirty but this is my second time I was married once before
oh ,  aha
and that one lasted seven years
aha
and now I've been married again two years
Oh ,  but you have a lot of communication with your second husband ,  ¿right ? 
Yes ,  yes
Oh ,  that's why i have ,  thank god i have a lot of communication with mine ,  that's why I've been with him for so many years
Yeah ,  it's a very important thing ,  that you talk ,  because if you don't talk ,  you are not going to get anywhere
Right ,  with talks and others ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  you get it ,  and he likes the same that you do
Uh huh ,  yes
Like ,  like i ,  i like to uh ,  go out to dance and listen to music and he does to
Likewise here too
And he likes communication very much
Uh huh
He likes a lot to go to the beach ,  the theater ,  and me too
Oh ,  right . 
I mean ,  there is a lot of communication ,  and lots of ,  uh ,  uh ,  uh ,  i mean ,  we both match mutually
Yeah ,  and yes ,  uh ,  five
¿do you have children ?  ,  oh wow ,  from the first ,  and what from the second ? 
Oh ,  i have four with the first and one with the second
Oh ,  i have two ,  a twenty eight girl and a twenty six boy
Oh ,  right
But
No ,  my ,  the oldest one is three ,  it's thirteen years old and the youngest one is one year old
oh wow
aha it's like this
and ,  and do you communicate a lot with your kids ?   Yes thank god I too
yes ,  aha ,  yes ,  ahhh
but now truly ,  for you to have a long term marriage ,  for many years and be happy there needs to be a lot of communication
yeah
and and much affection too
aha and trust
and mutual trust
aha with ,  uh ,  trust is one thing ,  if you don't have trust
aha
you won't get anywhere
no no no and jealous neither
well there are different ways to do it
aha
it's normal to have a little bit but
but if you're jealous it means that you don't trust your husband much
yes ,  I agree
aha
but I also think that a little bit of jealousy is good ,  aha
one aha a little bit but not so much so much so much that you go to
to look for them everywhere and so
aha and make him sick because they get sick of you being jealous or of your fights telling him things like if he is with another woman here and another one there
aha ,  yes
and that makes them sick of you and because of that there must be much confidence
yes
he with you and you with him too
aha ,  it is that way
yes yes yes but now for marriage ,  how many marriages last years and years and years
aha
and and some of them last only months or days
yes so I think that one of the things that make couples to fight is money
aha ,  aha
and and I think that money so fighting because of money is a normal thing
aha
I think all couples fight because of that
but specially if the woman earns more than the man
oh so
almost always there is a difference in that
oh aha in that case is not is not like that but I understand what you are saying
aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  do you work ? 
mm ah no
oh you are
with five kids in the house no
oh you're a housewife I do work I'm a babysitter
yes oh aha
and does your husband work ?  okay but
yes ,  he works in construction
aha ,  but but but you guys don't have that problem of arguing about money right
mm ah every now and then because something we don't have any
aha
because like I tell you well ah with five kids
with five kids aha aha aha
well a lot of expenses
aha aha and you told me you were from Nebraska ? 
yes
is very cold over there or is not cold
ah well yes is cold but ah right now is very hot
here in Chicago also
my mother in law lives there
in Chicago ?  where ? 
yes ,  ah it's called Home Town
Home Town I don't know
aha is like coming out of Chicago
aha
and my sister in law lives there also I think in Emanuel street
oh because I live in a place called Homebo Park
oh okay
that they now call Hombo Hights
okay
and what nationality are you ? 
what ? 
what nationality are you ? 
well I'm from here
oh from from ah
the United States
okay ,  okay ,  I'm Puerto Rican
Oh aha
so
and my husband is from Mexico
oh ,  ok ,  ok ,  OK
aha
so you have a happy marriage thank goodness
yes ,  now I do
and not before ? 
no ,  it was not
no ?  you didn't get along well ? 
no it was not that we didn't get along well ,  we did actually
oh ,  aha
but he got into some things he should never have
and how did you last that long with him ? 
oh ,  as I told you we got along fine ,  what separated us was
aha
that he was messing with things he souldn't have messed in ,  and he ended up in jail
oh aha
I resigned for two years with him in jail ,  until I couldn't bear any more
oh ok ,  but you were resigning for your kids
mhm yes
oh OK ok
aha ,  that happens often ,  most of the married people have kids
aha ,  aha
and although they don't go out or don't get along well
aha
they stay together for the kids and
oh for the kids so that the kids don't
don't suffer
don't suffer because our mistakes the kids especially pay for them
aha
when there's a divorce
that's true mm
yes yes yes I would also do it for my kids
aha
because first ,  second and third are your kids
aha
but one also has to think about oneself
aha
because you putting up with a man for your kids you are going to suffer and they are going to suffer also
that's true
like if you were putting up with that man and he was doing bad things
aha
thank God that your kids don't have this bad impression of him
aha
because he was a master in the house
yes
and and so you have a model you have to make a model of ,  of a mom
aha
of mom and of man at the same time so that your children don't suffer
yes aha ,  and well
and but your kids now know that their dad is far either the suffer or don't suffer
ah well they were very little
aha
when everything happened
oh
and so well ,  ah ,  well the suffer sometimes but they want to talk with him or like ,  because he isn't here
aha ,  oh
and sometimes this is difficult for me and it's difficult for them too
aha
but it's become a thing that they don't want to talk with him anymore now when they want something
aha aha aha aha
that they send him this and this and that
aha aha aha
and it's the only time that they want now with him
oh okay okay
hmm
but I say that the father ,  even if he's a bad man ,  will always be the father
yes
even and even if they've been bad bad bad
aha
they will always remember it and you always have to tell them ,  speak well of your father
I know
because an example ,  if you speak badly of him
hm
and they tell your dad ,  you dad can speak badly of you
this yes
as if you weren't a good mother
aha but it's ,  it's not a house like ,  I always got on well with their dad
hmm oh you have good communication with them ,  okay okay okay
yes ,  hmm and all of his family hmm
aha ,  aha ,  and you like your kids ?   Or like his family
yes oh yes
although although you don't live with him
oh yes and I still talk to his mom and all
aha aha aha
and when I talk to her she ah my daughter how are you
aha aha aha oh
ah we all get along really well still
oh that's good
it's just that things didn't work out between us

They are hypocrites ,  I don't like that .

Alright I have friends there in Virginia .  Yes . 
Oh ,  ¿yes ?  ,  the family ,  our family ,  my mom's and his ,  they're all in Philadelphia
Yeah ,  no ,  i have gone there ,  uh ,  leading to Virginia
Oh ,  yes ,  it's very ,  it's a very lon  way
Annie . 
Mildred .  Good afternoon .  My name is Mildred .  I'm Puerto Rican . 
Eh ,  my name is Annie .  And ,  My name is Annie and I live in Miami and I'm also Puerto Rican .  Hello ? 
Uh uh .  yes . 
Okay Eh ,  then . 
The word to discuss they said was marriage .  So what do you think of marriage ? 
yes .  Well . 
How many years have you been married ? 
Thirteen years . 
Thirteen years . 
And are you married ? 
Ah ,  at this moment I'm divorced . 
Ah . 
But I have five kids . 
Wow
And I was married nine years . 
Wow and what
But I'm already older I'm fifty six years old . 
That's not old , 
So I find that marriage is something very hard .  You need to have a lot of patience . 
Hmm . 
Much communication .   And the most important ,  respect from person to person . 
yes .   Just one second .   Sarah ,  please .   One moment ,  okay ,  as you can hear ,  I have a kid and
And when you're on the telephone ,  that's when they want to talk to you . 
what ? 
When you're on the phone ,  that's when they want you to watch them . 
yes .   yes .   She was calm so I went ,  I took the call ,  but but about marriage ,  let me see .   Well what you said ,  there needs to be a lot of communication .   We
At what age did you get married ?   How old ,  how do you think that you were able to endure these thirteen years ? 
Um ,  again ,  please ? 
How ,  how have you for thirteen years ,  how have you ,  you think ,  what has been the best point to achieve the marriage that you've been
you know ,  that has lasted for so many years . 
Um ,  I think that the faith in Jesus Christ that we have
Oh ,  you're both religious ? 
yes .   And this is the reason why ,  eh ,  there are many difficulties that we passed through and we kept ,  and ,  for this reason ,  we could ,  eh
You know ,  stay together .   My husband is also my best friend . 
Uh huh . 
So we spend all the time together that we can .   Now a bit less because we have a daughter . 
Uh huh . 
But you know I think that this and the communication always when we have problems it's because we weren't communicating
Marriage for me at times the differences ,  social differences many times
Mm
and I also found it hard the lack of communication and maturity of my partner .  And I also find it hard
the power when children come .  The situation is sometimes a little bit
Mm
harder because there is less time for the couple ,  children do demand a lot ,  and you may give away a little you own duties
And I think this makes the relationship a little harder ,  specially if your partner is not mature enough
yes
to ,  you know ,  help you out in the situation
Thank goodness ,  you know ,  my husband has always helped me and he ,  you know ,  is a very good man .  And now we are expecting
hopefully we will have a another baby ,  in November .  So .  .  .  You know ,  I know what he is telling you about the time ,  I can hear it
Uh uh ,  Mm
And I only have one ,  I can't imagine having five
yes ,  when you ,  when you have a lot of children ,  specially the economical situation
yes
its is what I think that also ,  um ,  makes the difference in the couple ,  It brings a lot of tension .  A big pressure
yes
if the economical situation is not as well as when you started ,  when you were as a couple ,  then the relationship becomes tense .  So ,  mm
Also this .  So ,  has this been your only couple then ?  Has this been your only marriage ? 
yes ,  thank goodness .  I met him and six months after we knew each other ,  yes dear it's raining ,  you know ,  six months after we met
we already knew we would marry .  But we waited ,  we were at the university ,  so we waited .  I think for four years .  And then we got married
So .   But what I said I never ,  I never would get married .   I never I never was going to ,  you know ,  I thought I would be one of those people who never got married but
you know .   The Lord had other plans for me . 
Well I got married after I was twenty four I had my first child .   So I first had two years in the relationship
Wow
of courtship and after we got married .   So after at twenty four I had my son .   And from there well I kept having my kids in a row ,  one after the other ,  so this didn't
like ,  got me down a bit as a person because I quit my studies
Hmm . 
I stopped all these things that I wanted to accomplish . 
yes . 
I hope that so I left them for the career of being a mother .   So the home ,  so the marriage got really tense . 
Hmm . 
My husband was really immature and the immaturity he had was like ,  was like a little kid . 
Hmm . 
So I had six kids instead of five . 
Wow wow .   And how old are your kids ? 
The oldest is thirty one . 
Wow . 
The other's twenty eight ,  the other's twenty six ,  one is twenty five and one that's here is the one who's stayed from ten
seven years since he graduated high school
Wow
So
Wow
They were hard times ,  then .  I got divorced when I was thirty two years old ,  from then on I raised my kids alone . 
Mm . 
I've been father and mother .  And although the father was always there for the economic needs and as a father ,  well he's been very good . 
I can't complain about that as a husband he was really bad but as a father ,  well he was good . 
That's good . 
So in the marriage after that I didn't get married again .  I decided not to because I thought that when I got married the first time it was
until I got really old and died like it said in the
yes . 
until death do you apart but it didn't work .  I believe that marriage well sometimes depends on the partner that one chooses and the maturity the couple has . 
Of the economic situations Of the understanding that you have as a couple .  With the other person . 
And also I think it was a different time too .  You know because I think that that is not necessarily always ,  but I think that men now
they are a little more eh help a little more I think than ,  than before . 
yes ,  the man now participates more in eh in that sense you're right .  Now the man seems to even participate in the birth ,  because before the man didn't
participate in any of that ,  he didn't even have anything to do with the kids . 
yes . 
All the load of the kids was for the woman . 
yes . 
So they didn't worry about anything now they all help with the pamper
yes . 
to give him food ,  to care for him ,  now there's a little bit more ,  they are more involved ,  more involved in the school . 
yes . 
Before the mother was the one in charge of giving the lessons of taking them to ballet classes ,  to ball games
all the activities would fall on us but now like you say is true .  The man participates a little more in the relationship . 
And I also think well I don't know ,  my husband is American .  But I also think that has a lot to do with it ,  because I know that when I see my
my Latin friends that I also know that their marriage is still a little bit harder .  Because the husband doesn't necessarily eh help or you know ? 
Uh uh
things like that .  But I don't know if it's something cultural or I don't know . 
Well ,  I already think is in part the culture but also that we as mothers when we raise our kids  because my eldest son no already has his baby
Uh uh . 
and he helps his wife do everything ,  everything ,  everything .  Understand .  He helps her with the baby .  He helps her with the house .  Sometimes he gets a little bit like
you know ,  he throws things here and there but she I think that already now they anyway have more participation than what they had before . 
Mm . 
That I couldn't count on them so to speak for all the things in the house ,  you couldn't count on them . 
Mm
So ,  I think in that sense ,  you also .  You're right because they participate more .  And the Latin man is a little bit more ,  depending on who raises them ,  they get used to it . 
be what we call ,  very chauvinistic . 
Uh uh
That ah ,  that's a woman thing . 
Mm . 
But now I think that's changing a lot in the in the education . 
Ah ,  how good . 
At least ,  at least I find that now the Latin man is changing a bit .  He's not as chauvinistic as before . 
¡Hello . 
¡Yeah ,  hi . 
Good ,  uh ,  good afternoon ,  uh ,  ¿who do i have the pleasure to talk to ? 
Oh ,  my name is David
David ,  my name is Silvia
Silvia ,  ¿How are you ? 
Fine ,  thanks ,  ¿where do you live ? 
I live in Connecticut
Oh ,  in Connecticut
Yes ,  ¿where are you calling from ? 
From Philadelphia , 
oh ,  from Philadelphia
Yes
¿How's the weather over there ? 
Uh ,  um ,  uh ,  it's more ,  um ,  it's getting fresher
Oh ,  OK
And where you
Over here ,  more or less .  no ,  it hasn't rained ,  almost everything is dry outside ,  more or less
Oh ,  yes ,  here ,  here it's been a while since it rained ,  but little by little autumn's coming in
Yes ,  little by little ,  how's everything ? 
Oh ,  very well ,  thank you ,  eh ,  it catches my
Oh
attention ,  since this is a study of the University of Pennsylvania that is placed here ,  it catches my attention that the two people I have talked to have
been one from New York and now one in Connecticut . I don't know ,  it catches my attention that they recruit people ,  eh ,  so far away from the University
The other time I did this program I was getting a lot of calls from people in Long Island
Ah
From the county of  New York ,  around there
aha ,  aha ,  aha
I think that the system is just checking ,  ahmm ,   the voices of people .  Because when I called the ne  the other time it was in English ,  English all the time
So ,  my Spanish is not ,  well ,  it is as good as should be ,  right ? 
oh ,  because you were born here .  And
yes ,  I was born here
oh
But there ,  it was in an agency in Spanish ,  to talk on the phone for ten minutes
yes ,  yes ,  and they said the subject had to be marriage
That's what they say ,  but you can talk about whatever you wan ,  that is not in thet
oh ,  oh ,  yes
yes ,  because they don't record anything ,  they are just checking the telephone lines ,  cellular telephones .  I don't know what kind of telephone are you at
I am at a regular telephone
A regular telephone
Normal yes ,  but they don´t ,  don´t record the conversation
No ,  they don´t record a thing if ,  one time I called and the gentleman who was talking to me
Hmm
He said ,  wait a moment ,  and held me on the phone for five minutes without any talking And it is that way ,  usually they want to know if they are talking to people or I don´t know how  was the study
I don´t ,  I don´t know what they are looking for at the study It seems to me that they are looking for patterns
the changes of used expressions or
aha
it is logical that they don´t tell you what are they looking for
aha
so your behavior can be totally natural Eh ,  but I am curious about what they are doing at the study . 
Sure .  So ,  I talked with one of the guys because that study has been made many times One time I made it and it was in English ,  it was more ,  more
I was more comfortable with the people .  But the guy put me on the phone and told me ,  wait a second ,  I called the lady who was making the study
And she told us ,  don´t worry ,  we are only measuring the time of phone use ,  like the signal on the phone ,  from the air ,  she was saying something like that
No ,  I don´t think that´s correct ,  I don´t think so because Why ?  because they will not look for it in several languages . 
Oh ,  of course ,  that too ,  because don´t ,  don´t ,  never ,  I don´t know why they are doing it in Spanish
yes ,  and I know last year they made it in Spanish and they made it in Russian
In what ?  ,  Which languages ? 
in Russian
yes , 
yes ,  and maybe it was made in Chinese too
Ah ,  I don't know .  I've seen ,  I've seen it in English the other time ,  only
In other words yes ,  no ,  but they have done it in several foreign languages ,  so there's got to be ,  eh ,  eh something linguistic Eh ,  although maybe there's a technological part but it also has it's linguistic component . 
So then I think that they are recording the words that one is using .  To see if they can convert them I think ,  I don't know , 
mm
by the ,  the ,  the ,  how do you say it ?  so then what was it ,  marriages ,  right ? 
yes , 
and what do you want to talk about marriage ,  Are you married ? 
No ,  I'm divorced
Oh ,  really
yes ,  And you ? 
okay yes ,  I've been divorced also ,  but I'm living with my woman
Oh ,  with your what , 
With my partner ,  my ah ,  my girlfriend
Ah ,  okay ,  mm
Ah ,  we bought a little house up here
And where do you live ? 
I live over here by ,  I used to live before in ,  in the outskirts of New York city
Aha
I lived in ,  in the outskirts of the Bronx more or less
ah ,  aha ,  mm
Because i was married ,  so yeah ,  i didn't ,  i didn't get convinced with women ,  i have only one son
Um ,  right ,  uh huh ,  right
Right ,  but women who marry ,  when you get married everything changes more or less
yes ,  yes ,  yes
It's not the same ,  you know ,  when you're dating ,  you enjoy it ,  you have a good time ,  so when you start ,  you get married ,  so everything changes more or less
It's not the same way right ?  ,  they don't treat you
interesting ,  yes ,  i have reached almost the same conclusion ,  uh ,  maybe I'd express it in a bit of a different way ,  but ,  but yeah
Uh ,  i have reached the same conclusion ,  that there is a time in the relationship where ,  where the way people behaves changes ,  it goes mostly downwards
Uh huh ,  yeah ,  sure ,  i thought ,  i ,  i ,  the same ,  the same song ,  because when what you need the most is respect ,  because you can't ,  you know ,  you ,  you
You feel like you can't get out because you're married
Yes
And you have to put up with the ,  the reasons for people and that's harder ,  staying together ,  uh ,  as boyfriends ,  you know ,  because you can get out whenever you want to ,  ¿right ?  ,  because there's no ,  nothing's legal
Yes ,  yes ,  there's no legal side
Right ,  because it's more ,  it's harder to stay together because that way ,  so you love each other more ,  because there's nothing to ,  you don't have to be there ,  ¿right ? 
Yes ,  it's true
And if you leave ,  you have to pay ,  that's another ,  for ,  for ,  you know ,  it's harder to stay together ,  you know ,  without getting married
And ,  that's it ,  i think that for me ,  I've been with my girlfriend for almost ,  almost ten years
Uh
And we're not married ,  and i can get out ,  even better than wen i got married
Uh huh ,  uh huh
Well ,  because when I got married the first time I was young ,  I got married when I was twenty three . 
hmm
You know ,  and it only lasted six months
aye , 
So it was the second time that I ,  it was also the same when I got married ,  everything changed ,  but since I was already married I didn't want to fail at another marriage more or less ,  so I stayed there for seven years . 
hmm
And yea ,  but ,  you know we're still friends ,  but it's more difficult to stay friends than to be there in a marriage that doesn't work ,  doesn't
yes , 
Because it's more agree ,  life
yes , 
For me this is more ,  it's more ,  and something happens in a relationship when you say some things and ,  and she doesn't like it .   You know
I have a relationship ,  hmm
You know ,  you can leave when you want ,  you know ,  take your clothes and go
yes
yes ,  there aren't any other actions that you can do ,  no
yes ,  yes
But when you've voiced ,  you're always calling ,  you do the other on credit ,  that your house ,  this that and the other
yes
It's more difficult I think ,  you can ,  not being married
But it's funny that ,  that a man would say that when the relationship has a certain formality ,  the woman more or less stops treating him well ,  and women feel this from men
yes ,  I think so ,  but to me ,  in my case it was different because my wife went to school and ,  you know ,  we were , 
aha
She was still very young ,  you know ,  she graduated at high school then she went to college ,  so the house keeping
you know ,  she didn't cook .  I had ,  I knew she was going to school ,  so ,  eh ,  I didn't pressure her too much to cook ,  so I used to go to my mom's house
or I went out for lunch ,  right ? 
mm
But ,  to help her ,  I didn't pressure her too much .  But I think it was worse ,  because ,  you know ,  she didn't do the things you have to do when
when you are already married .  You have to do some things ,  because there is ,  how you call it ?  ,  there is more work to do in the house ,  you know ,  because of the marriage ,  to maintain the marriage
yes
Then ,  if there is not such in the house ,  I mean ,  there is not ,  there is not ,  to keep the marriage strong .  There was no time for that ,  she was always at school ,  and this and that
She didn't have the time to do the housekeeping ,  and that harms the marriage .  It's better to go on like boyfriends .  If you do it ,  you do it ,  and if you don't do it
you know ,  it's alright ,  but when you are married yo have to ,  you have to do it ,  you know ,  it's more
Hello hi .

yes ,  look ,  and what country are you from ? 
Puerto Rican . 
Ah ,  mm
Puerto Ri 
It's caught my attention that this is a study that the university of Pennsylvania does that's located in Philadelphia .  And ,  I thought that
the majority of the people were going to be from Philadelphia and ,  I haven't talked to anyone from Philadelphia .  I've talked to people from New York and
you are the second one from Connecticut . 
I've talked to people from Miami ,  now with you . 
Ah ,  how weird ,  How
No .  because I think that they try to make it how do you say it ?  general
yes . 
for different nationalities and in different states . 
yes ,  but I say ,  how ,  how do they find people out of the area ? 
No ,  because one registers in the ,  in the computer and they find you with the e mail . 
Ah ,  okay ,  okay ,  okay . 
Aha . 
Well . 
yes ,  how many years have you been married ? 
I'm divorced . 
Oh ,  me too .

yes ,  I got divorced when my kid was twenty five like twenty two ,  ah ,  twenty three years back
Ah ,  you've been divorced since then . 
yes . 
Hmm . 
I had other boyfriends but I never got married again . 
how curious ,  right ?   I was talking yesterday with a man who was also from Connecticut who told me that he'd been married twice ,  but it was all that when he got married that
the relationship changed and
Well ,  marriage always changes relationships ,  it's not the same as a boyfriend who sees you and goodbye that after you have to put up with him there with
with the odors with the gas with
yes . 
all the bad manners we have
yes . 
it's different ,  you can be ,  how do you say ?   Eh ,  it's not the same living together than being sep  living alo  you in your house and me in mine . 
You know ?   When you were separated well
yes ,  yes ,  only to reunite ,  do things . 
Aha .  And ,  and Why did you get divorced ?  Because it went eh ,  your marriage went bad or ? 
yes ,  the marriage was bad ,  yes ,  yes ,  Eh ,  I've been divorced like ten years . 
Oh ,  ten years .  I eh ,  my husband was a very good man ,  very good father
Aha . 
no ,  good good man ,  good person good father but a lover boy ,  very much a womanizer
Ah . 
He liked to be out a lot ,  with women ,  dancing
Ah ,  no ,  there's no woman . 
spending the money
Mm . 
but ,  as a father ,  he was an excellent father .  Very good father ,  very responsible with the kids . 
Ah ,  how many kids do you have ? 
Five . 
Ah ,  mm . 
Five but they are already adults and they are all prepared ,  they each have their career ,  well the young one who's left ,  who's seventeen years old ,  graduates now from
from high school this year . 
Ah . 
yes ,  but .  I find that marriage is also eh ,  a lot of responsibility ,  especially with the kids
yes . 
that always falls on the woman not the man . 
yes ,  exactly .  That it falls on the woman ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  I don't ,  mm ,  eh ,  I'm not interested in getting married again . 
Me neither . 
yes . 
I have ,  I live with someone but I don't want to get married . 
Mm .  That's what
I'm very happy ,  we're happy ,  it doesn't bother me .  I don't know if maybe later down the road ,  when we think of buying a house maybe we decide to get married again but
Mm . 
but for now I don't think so . 
yes ,  look ,  where do you live in Connecticut ? 
In
Like by where ?  I ,  I know a little bit of Connecticut . 
It's close to New York closer to New York
Ah ,  aha
Like an hour from New York
Ah .  And ,  and ,  you go to New York to work ? 
Ah ? 
Do you guys go to New York to work ? 
No ,  I work right here and ,  and my boyfriend ,  he works as a limousine driver ,  so
Ah . 
he goes everywhere . 
Aha ,  And ,  and ,  have a lot of interesting stories about the clients you have in the limousine ? 
Always happens ,  yes .  And ,  how many kids do you have ? 
I have three .  Eh ,  the
Three ,  from ,  my first marria  ,  the only marriage or
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  from ,  from the only marriage .  Devan who's twenty three yes ,  I have one who's going to be twenty four in a few days .  And the youngest is twenty . 
Oh ,  at least he's already raised . 
yes ,  and yes ,  and she already finished the university and is working . 
And ,  do you maintain a good relationship after the divorce with the father ? 
yes ,  yes ,  luckily I've maintained a good relationship ,  yes . 
yes ,  mine too ,  mine comes here with his wife ,  he visits us ,  we travel together
Ah ,  how nice . 
we have a very open relationship ,  for the happiness of the kids ,  so
That's rare to be able
so than nothing harms them
be able to reunite two couples that way . 
Oh ,  yes ,  we ,  I ,  since I got divorced I sat him down and talked to him and told him ,  well ,  we are already old
yes . 
we are not going to change ,  but we have four little seeds ,  five little seeds there that will go up
yes . 
that will go up and depend on ,  on us and we want them to grow straight and go well if not they will be harmed .  So
We agree ,  so we had a really open relationships ,  he always had the kids when he wanted
Hmm . 
I never kept him from visiting them . 
yes ,  and wasn't it really difficult raising five kids ? 
It's difficult ,  but you're strong with them ,  they know ,  they respect you .   If you let them  if you let them take power ,  especially in this country ,  kids
well ,  when you get divorced and they see that the dad isn't there ,  they can try to take advantage of you because they have a lot of right ,  but I don't let ti happen . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
They've always had respect for me and for their father . 
yes ,  yes ,  and have you felt that it's more difficult to raise kids correctly here than in Puerto Rico ? 
Oh ,  yes ,  sure .   Much more difficult .   Much more difficult because you give them some rights and you ,  they're given a lot ,  eh ,  there's
what they call liberty and debauchery . 
Sure ,  yes . 
And the kids confuse them ,  you know ?   They don't know
yes . 
which is liberty and which is debauchery . 
yes . 
And debauchery ,  well it brings the lack of respect towards parents and when they see that they don't have a father figure in
yes . 
The marriage is dissolved and ,  and there's no father figure ,  well they always try to go
yes . 
where it shouldn't ,  shouldn't be
yes ,  yes . 
but for this ,  since I'm a woman my mom and dad ,  you have to keep them at a certain distance so you can
yes .   I told my daughter
put out the
that with everything and when I scolded her for acting incorrectly to me ,  this is nothing compared to the behavior of her American friends towards their parents
Oh yes ,  my daughter's girl hits her mom . 
Hmm . 
She hits her as if she was a woman on the street . 
Hmm . 
And I told my daughter ,  the day you raise your hand to me ,  you'll be without her because I will cut you off for disrespect ,  the child who lifts his hand to his mother ,  doesn't have respect . 
So ,  your grandchild hits your daughter ? 
No ,  not my grandchild ,  her classmate
Ah ,  the classmate ,  ah
from my daughter's school .   She hits her mom . 
Aye ,  how barbaric . 
No ,  I I don't .   My daughter one day came to yell at me and I said ,  here you lower your voice because the only one who yells is me . 
The loud voice and here I am . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
The person who sings loudly and talks ugly is me ,  no ,  not anyone else . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
yes ,  because they think that since the dad isn't ,  eh ,  I think that it's very difficult ,  eh ,  marriages are a difficult thing ,  and when kids come
even more difficult . 
yes ,  it's difficult ,  and I feel that the man ,  when
So
already has a women ,  he doesn't care how he treats her . 
They ,  they treat ,  well ,  I wouldn't let that mine as soon as I see that he's not acting well ,  mine ,  and I would say let him be a womanizer ,  but he wasn't ,  how do you say ? 
I wouldn't let him abuse me . 
yes .   Hmm . 
Because the day that he raises his hand against me ,  I'll get up ,  well ,  over there
Hmm . 
I said ,  that's it .   This is where we've both come to
yes . 
Because it's not worth it ,  when there's no respect it's not worth continuing a relationship
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
So ,  who will suffer are the kids
Such a shame ,  right ? 
The ki  ,  the kids always pay ,  the sins of one or
yes ,  so sad ,  right ? 
yes . 
But ,  but ,  I congratulate you for having raised five kids ,  without ,  without ,  without their father helping you out ,  I'm sure that was a pretty hard job to do
and you have to go out and work and then when you get back home you have to take care of five children . 
yes ,  it's tough ,  very tough ,  specially whit the boys
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
I had a son that caused a lot of trouble ,  but thank God ,  I kind of  let him get a good lesson and he learned from that ,  thank
he now has his own house ,  he lives there with his girlfriend ,  they are very happy
Mm . 
but for a while ,  he was hanging out with bad influences ,  friends
Can you hear me ? 
Hello ? 
Can you hear me ?  I'm Joe ,  What's your name ? 
I'm Jose . 
Jose
what
Where are you from Jose ? 
From Philadelphia
From Philadelphia ? 
yes ,  And you ? 
I'm from Colorado ,  What nationality are you ? 
ah ,  my father is Guatemalan and my mother is Cuban . 
oh ,  I
yes ,  Yes I was born in Guatemala and came here to the United States when I was five or six years old . 
so you've been here a long time then . 
eh ,  no ,  but I return every ,  every summer to Guatemala . 
oh
I spend my summers there ,  then . 
And how is Guatemala ,  is it nice over there ? 
ah ,  very nice ,  very nice ,  because everybody that ,  Guatemala is a country like that .  Of ,  eh ,  eh ,  like with jungles and beaches ,  but
has ,  it is a very mountainous country ,  then it has the capital city ,  it is ah ,  eh ,  it is ,  it is on the mountains ,  then it is very cold  well it is not cold but for example when I go to Philadelphia
to Guatemala ,  always .  There is less cold in Guatemala . 
Oh ,  yes ? 
And ,  and everybody thinks ,  how can you go to Guatemala ,  that must be ,  hotter than here ,  but seriously it is not like that ,  no but then it is mountainous ,  it has beaches ,  it has , 
ah Mayan ruins ,  it has ,  it has everything it is a country .  Very ,  very interesting ,  but
With a very rich culture . 
That too ,  that too ,  And where are you from ? 
I was born in Puerto Rico ,  I have been living in Colorado for around twenty six years . 
hmm
And it is very beautiful here ,  there has been a long time without going to Puerto Rico ,  I have always loved my island ,  I miss it ,  but I have my home here . 
yes yes
And I am happy in Colorado and I have a daughter I love so much . 
ah ,  that is good
She fills me with happiness . 
yes ,  eh ,  is not that I don´t ,  I have been very lucky because my dad ,  luck and not because of ,  luck because I have
came back to Guatemala every summer , 
yes
and but is not lucky that my father is still living there ,  then it is sometimes difficult because
oh ,  he is still living there . 
yes ,  he is still living there ,  so ,  yes
Oh ,  what a pity .  And my mother is still alive ,  she is the only one to survive me of my two parents ,  so ,  she lives in Puerto Rico and I only see her
once a year ,  she comes to visit me ,  but I always miss her a lot ,  she is a nice person and
eh
my daughter is crazy about her ,  her grandma
oh ,  and its is hard ,  this point ,  I know that to my dad it is a little sad knowing that we will never
go back to Guatemala ,  to live there ,  because ,  seriously ,  I came here when I was five or six years old
yes
My sister came here when she was maybe eight years old ,  my brother was four years old .  And yes ,  here ,  when you go to the
American schools ,  american universities ,  you start working here ,  you ,  you are no longer from Guatemala ,  for instance ,  right ? 
yes
You have it clear that you will always keep a little ,  of the culture of that country
Sure
But when I ,  for instance ,  go back to Guatemala ,  I feel like it is not ,  seriously ,  it is not my country ,  really ,  I don't know .  Because I have spent so much time here in the United States ,  right ? 
But then I think that it ,  it must be hard for him
eh ,  and I feel a little confused ,  when I go
but
to Puerto Rico ,  because since I have been here so long I am very impregnated with American culture
mhm mhm
also educated here and so ,  the I find it very hard to adapt , I feel ,  I feel sometimes when I go there ,  I feel everything is so small
mm
how the things there ,  for example the traffic is terrible and
yeah
this made me despair ,  I don't like driving in places where everyone is honking and say get out of the way and this
ah ,  yes
a bit rude ,  but in general the people of Puerto Rico are really nice and good ,  the one that . 
yes
since there are so many people living on the little island at times , 
hmm
eh ,  it's uncomfortable ,  like ,  the lack of work sometimes ,  but there's ,  I have you already been to Colorado . 
hmm .   No ,  no ,  never ,  well I live here in Philadelphia and I never had the change to go there ,  I've seen here ,  the United States , 
I've actually only been to New York ,  Washington ,  Philadelphia .   I lived in Tennessee for a few years
Oh ,  you lived in Tennessee
And in Virginia ,  there close to the ,  in the northeast ,  the northeast of Tennessee ,  close to Virginia . 
yes
Well first I lived in Virginia .   So ah there close to ,  there in Tennessee ,  so we didn't cross to Tennessee ,  we only crossed the border and so I lived in Virginia for some years ,  Tennessee . 
ah ,  I've visited my Cuban family down in Miami .   But ,  that's all ,  I don't know California ,  Colorado ,  Texas ,  no ,  no
Like you have never come to the center of the United States ,  to the west ,  you've never been on this side . 
No ,  ex exactly ,  no ,  no .   And you ,  you've been to Philadelphia before ? 
well I never went to Philadelphia but I know it's a very pretty city .   And yes I've been in many parts of the eastern United States ,  including New York . 
I have family from New York to Florida ,  I have .   A lot of family there ,  cousins ,  uncles . 
Uh huh ,  uh huh
I have half brothers there in New York ,  and in New Jersey too ,  and in South Carolina ,  i have family in all those states ,  so i asked you about Tennessee because
yes
i work with a salesman at my company that's located in Tennessee ,  that's his area ,  and his territory covers Tennessee ,  Arkansas ,  Louisiana and ,  ¿what was the other ?  ,  Mississippi
Oh
Areas that were affected by the hurricane ,  so ,  well ,  that makes me think about him ,  because he's located there ,  i also have a good friend
who moved there a few years ago ,  that i unfortunately lost contact with ,  but he always told me how beautiful Tennessee is
Uh huh ,  oh ,  yes ,  yes .  yes ,  well ,  my grandmother from Guatemala came ,  well ,  she went once to visit us in Tennessee and she was delighted because
yes
uh ,  she thought it was very interesting ,  that for example ,  in the United States ,  everyone mowed the lawn and did all of that . 
Yes
That's what she thought ,  yea ,  uh ,  interesting ,  ¿right ?  ,  that she never ,  she had never seen that
that's good ,  that's good
Yeah ,  ¿right ?  ,  but it's a ,  it's a very beautiful state ,  it has a lot ,  it's less industrialized than other coun  ,  than other states
Yes
And no ,  it's very beautiful ,  i feel it's also a place ,  i don't know ,  healthy ,  in the way that it's not a place like with a lot of crime ,  it's not a place like that . 
With ,  with lot's of like gangs or ,  uh ,  it's more healthier ,  ¿right ? 
yes
i feel ,  yeah ,  Tennessee is a very healthy place ,  and i don't know ,  but my mom ,  she didn't ,  i don't know ,  she thought that for us ,  for the kids , 
well it would be better uh ,  to live in a big city where there's culture ,  where there are lots of activities ,  where there are more opportunities ,  so that's why we moved here
yes ,  that's good
to Philadelphia ,  yes ,  yes ,  we ,  well ,  my mom now lives in the outskirts of Philadelphia but I study here ,  in the city . 
What are you studying ? 
So ,  I'm studying finances ,  yes
Ah yes ,  that's great ,  do you really like it ,  do you want to work on that ? 
ah ,  well yes ,  I don't know if I'm going to work on t hat but I think that ,  well ,  I don't like ,  I don't really like finances but they are interesting ,  so
I'm more interested in economy course ,  not so much finances ,  I believe that finances are too much ,  I don't know
It can be boring . 
eh ,  well ,  a bit boring ,  yes a bit boring ,  but they don't make so much sense ,  it's like ,  you can get confused with all those numbers
yes
and you can't see the real results ,  however ,  in economy ,  you can see ,  for example ,  if you lower the taxes ,  you can see the effects
the real effects that you see in people's lives and
yes
yes ,  yes ,  it's not that clear ,   I think it's an interesting subject ,  so ,  when I go to work ,  I'll finish school in May ,  so
yes
I'd like to work for a year or two ,  ah in the government working as an economist ,  so I'd like to then go back to school and get a grade in economy ,  so
I'd like to get a job there ,  or in a bank ,  I feel that so many jobs are boring ,  you don't do anything interesting
yes
eh ,  we just have one problem after another ,  and they are just stupid little problems ,  I believe
hello ,  yes my name is Tamy
hello ,  what ? 
my nam  Tamy
hello ,  I'm ,  fine ,  and you ? 
ah ,  how are you ?  we spoke the other day ?

yes
yes ,  it's the same thing every day
y yesterday I talked with another girl from Washington

and how many calls can you make in a day ,  on e one or two ? 
only one
ah
yes because yesterday they called me twice
and listen ,  you could do it twice ? 
yes I think that no ,  I didn't do it because I was reading my thing on the computer ,  I say no ,  you can only do it one time like this
so I answered the second time ,  because the first time he called me but I was outside painting when I came in ,  I saw that they called me so I called
yes
and after they called me like this at nine and night and
hmm ,  I think that you can do more than once
and after they gave me to see ,  my role when I stopped ,  I was living in the role and they sent me an email and it said that they only wanted me to participate in a call
by day
oh
so I said well ,  well I'll sign up why not
I ,  I've done two or three but like this it will finish more quickly
recognize well this is what was said ,  so if ,  if if they leave you good
hmm

no ,  I have this on my telephone but I have a ,  in front of my house in the door of my house I have a
a camera and also for

I don't go to the door ,  instead I say ,  what do you want ? 
oh ,  oh ,  okay
and ,  and so ,  only to annoy he said ,  hi ,  here I am ,  I'm in the house ,  so that I saw
him here and I'm here tired with pain and he was outside and there was a fight outside

Uh uh .

Did you move a long time ago or before ?

Ah ,  well no ,  I didn't live through this tragedy there the
Yeah . 
the nine eleven
No I was already here ,  yeah . 
Ah ,  how cool ,  I was here in Philadelphia and this was here ,  I saw it well .   I think I saw it the same as the whole country ,  ugly . 
Hmm .   Yeah .   Well
And now .   Huh ? 
I went to visit the area when ,  well ,  like a week after it happened ,  I went . 
Ah . 
And I saw the whole building and that it had fallen and all that and it was really ugly . 
Really ? 
Hmm . 
I tell you ,  I wouldn't go if a lot of time hadn't passed ,  no ? 
Hmm . 
even if it's close ,  no ?   It affected me a lot .   And now I'm affected by that of New Orleans
Oh yes .   Until uh huh yeah . 
so many things ,  right ?   Even if you don't hear much here about the hurricane . 
No ,  here this almost .   Still how good the last year I think that it was not this year but the year before there was a hurricane and and
it didn't touch here much but it seems that it affected a lot of people . 
In in Virginia . 
Uh uh . 
Ah ,  because here I see many of this year in those days when the hurricane was in New Orleans
Mm . 
And then it rained ,  rained but then later nothing else happened
Mm
it got fixed but they are still taking out people .  That's horrible . 
yes .  I think that here
In this country yes ,  right ? 
they moved a few people over here .  This is a town more more
They sent .  Here they also sent six hundred or I don't know or
Mm . 
oh there's still a lot that have to be sent I don't know
Because I work part time in a department store and they were they were telling us about the cards they gave them
Mm . 
that
Ah ,  yes . 
is that yes ,  the
The red cross ,  right ? 
uh uh . 
Mm . 
yes ,  people come are paying with this ,  well we don't have to go down this because we don't have to charge tax
Ah . 
uh huh .   They can buy and so we don't charge them tax because this is
Ah ,  yes this yes . 
uh huh .   It's different to
Oh .   Ah an expense of the other person
Uh huh . 
Ah . 
So this well we have to do this some arrangements like this .   Different from other people . 
what a thing . 
Yeah . 
They will give case and I believe in those who are here . 
Hmm . 
or living especially .   I don't know how it will be but they will give something . 
Hmm .   What will they do with this .   Happened after what they tried is for people and great ,  or they stay where they are ?   Because this will be a good time to go to
enough time ,  true ,  to clean this . 
uh huh .   And after
because now there are many infections . 
uh huh ,  well sometimes you think this will be good ,  they say that they clean it but they actually don't clean it very well . 
ah ah ah ,  true .   I think that those who are most used to it to will want to come back ,  right ? 
Mm .  Well there are people that don't want to leave . 
Mm .  I know . 
that are still there . 
Uh uh . 
Because since they have this dog ,  animals
Ah ,  yes . 
these pets
They don't want to leave them . 
uh uh . 
And I saw in the televi 
To
sion others saying ,  let me die here ,  leave me alone ,  I don't know what . 
Yes .  Mm . 
but like they're going to be removed anyways . 
yes they are saying that the government is going to force them to leave but I say ,  the government can't say
Of course . 
for you to leave your house
That I wouldn't know how it is because if the house is in a dry and peaceful place right ?  that's fine I understand if they remove them . 
Mm .  Uh uh .  And that's what they were saying also .  That there are people that are in an area that's fine you know they don't have electricity or water but that
are not flooded .  You know ,  no no ,  they are dry . 
is
The water didn't didn't harm him . 
I say that those would depend on the health studies right . 
mm . 
Because even if one has a dry place maybe a pipe that goes through
Oh ,  yes . 
by where it's dirty and then
They said that you can't not to drink the water . 
oh God ,  what a tragedy .  They say is the worst tragedy that has occurred ,  right ? 
Mm .  In a long time already . 
Here .  I don't understand ,  and I wanted to go over there .  True that I always use to say
Mm . 
I'd like to know that I'd like to go there because they would tell me it was very lively . 
Uh uh Yes .

But ,  let see what else .  We have to talk like ten minutes ,  right ?  I'm looking at this of nine eleven . 
Ah . 
What happened on nine eleven The guys that fought back . 
Ah yes . 
From one of the flights that fought back from Pennsylvania .  I believe is from Pennsylvania . 
Ah oh okay now well the day that you remember the
Yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes .

But my husband had the day off that day .  So
Ah ,  look .  It's God's mercy .  I suppose . 
Yes .  Yes ,  is true ,  is true .  You never know .

ah ,  yes the hurricane yes that's also terrible ,  so many people in
Oh my God
home ,  so many
Oh my God ,  my God . 
everything was flooded . 
That's terrible . 
So many houses were destroyed . 
Oh yes ,  one fights to get things ,  we throw away bread and food and we just throw it away but then other people starving to death
yes ,  well ,  yes ,  it's the same thing when children refuse to eat ,  I'd tell them that ,  I'd tell them that other children don't have food to eat
and you still refuse to eat . 
I took care of that at Weight Watchers ,  they tell you not to eat things ,  don't listen to your mother
Weight Watchers are trying to get you to loose weight
I see . 
So ,  you know ,  they tell you not to eat all the food in your plate or to use a smaller plate so that you feel that the plate is full of food . 
I see ,  anyway .  What else do you do ? 
Uh uh . 
What else ?  Do you have lots of friends in Georgia ? 
yes ,  I do have my friends from the church I belong to . 
What church do you belong to ?

oh ,  okay ,  okay ,  okay ,  okay .  And your kids dress like that also ? 
No ,  no ,  no .  Not yet . 
No ?  oh ,  not yet . 
No ,  they are very little ,  sometimes no
oh ,  okay
No .  Sometimes I put on them
Uh uh . 
We put on their short .  No ,  is like a cloth ,  a habit . 
Uh uh ,  oh ,  and how did you get into it ?  When you came to Georgia or do you have that in Peru ? 
No ,  I was already ,  I was already a devotee in my country
Ah .  Ah . 
No .  Like twenty years ago . 
Ah .  Interesting .  Wow
So then I'm a vegetarian .  I don't eat meat nor eggs nor fish . 
Oh ,  that's good Then you are thin ,  right ? 
Yes more or less although the kids very thin
Yes ,  because if you don't eat eggs or meat
Uh uh
Because the meat makes one fat
Yes ,  so .  Especially here that there's so many .  Chemicals and additives that they put in the animals and in everything
Uh uh .  Yes Yes Yes . 
all those things there are very fat people ,  too ,  too fat
You're telling me . 
What
Wow ,  Then all the calls you've made you can talk about anything ? 
Yes ,  here they say you can talk the
Or they give you
the important thing is that one engages in a conversation
Yeah ,  uh huh
And you also have to say something about ,  about the word marriage ,  something like that . 
Oh ,  because he said we could talk about anything
Anything
Oh ,  because
But's it's like a guide ,  they give the word marriage
Oh ,  for ten minutes ,  i mean i can talk about marriage too ,  but
Oh ,  you ,  but you already
I said
¿Are you separated or are you there ? 
I married for the second time
Oh ,  you got married on ,  oh ,  OK
This is my second ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  because my oldest baby is thirty seven ,  and i have two grandsons in ,  in
Um
Florida
Uh huh
So ,  this little one is fourteen years old
Oh ,  they're not so young ,  it's a teenager
Yeah ,  a teenager yeah .  But he's still my baby ,  you know
Oh ,  i can imagine ,  for the mother .  The children ,  even if they're bigger ,  they're their babies
Ay ,  God .   Aye ,  no .   And now that you go to oh my God .   You know you see the changes ,  his face is changing . 
Hmm . 
The ,  the leg ,  hair is already growing and I say ,  oh my God ,  and now he's starting to look at girls .   I have to shut him in . 
All the changes of the hormones there . 
Aye . 
Yes , 
Yes ,  my god .   You pray because one time I worked in the high school where he goes and I see all the boys who have changed
Hmm . 
You know since they entered ,  they changed
Sure . 
And some are worse ,  and some already have hairs ,  and I say ,  ah God ,  that my kid
Aye ,  yes .   They think they're really independent and can do what they want . 
Yes .   Yes .   Yes .   So sometimes
Hmm . 
they follow the other groups
Hmm . 
You know the bad groups ,  for this today I was telling him to be a leader .   You don't want to be ,  you don't have to follow anyone . 
Hmm . 
You want to be the leader .   And he told me ,  no ,  it doesn't matter to me .   Because you ,  since you're small and you catch and you do
what they wants and they tell you . 
Mm . 
So now we are swearing that it grows He already tells me ,  mommy I'm going to be tall like my dad or little like you .  I don't know ,  but God willing
that you are tall .  Yes
Ah ,  yes the kids when they start changing is the bad thing right ,  because one has to be very understand them ,  listen to them and
Uh uh .  Yes
they become rebellious
Yes .  And I ,  I have one that Has this how do you say it adhd who's hyperactive . 
Uh uh . 
And he ,  and he this year decided that he's not going to take the medicine .  With God's help
Oh . 
Because he says that the medicine changes him too much . 
Yes . 
You know eh . 
Yes ,  those medicines are a little a little unpleasant .  They have a lot
Yes ,  Yes .  Yes . 
a lot of side effects how they call it . 
Yes ,  Yes .  Yes . 
No ,  and . 
So he ,  he decided that no and up to now he's behaving very good you know and God willing he'll be able to get everything that the classes
understand everything .  That's the problem ,  that he might not understand the class . 
Mm . 
So I ,  since I know the teachers ,  they are going to work with me .  So then I said if you behave good and
Sure . 
hello hi
hello
how are you ?  Nice to meet you
nice to meet you ,  my name is Annie and your name
Josefina ,  How are you ?  Where are you ,  far ? 
in Miami
I'm here in Philadelphia
oh
so we are in the ,  the same side but you are in the area of the tropic how are you ?  have you been getting calls for a long time ? 
yes no this is my second
ah okay perfect ,  and what do you think of it well you've only talked with one other person only Right ? 
yes And you ? 
like three
ah how nice
we are starting ,  yes em well the two people I spoke with were very pleasant ,  and do you study or are you working ? 
ah I ,  no I I stay home with my daughter
ah you have a daughter
yes
ah how nice I have a son but he already got married
oh
It's a very old man ,  uh ,  that ,  ¿what did you her the subject was ?  ,  because i think it was something about religion ,  ¿right ? 
yeah ,  i ,  all i could understand .  .  .  because that person's accent is very difficult
right
is whether religion divides or unifies
right ,  OK and
that ,  so he started talking about something else but i didn't
yeah ,  that if there could be things that separate people between christiahism and Islam
uh ,  ha
or ,  yeah ,  i think so ,  i think that a person's religion is very different from another ,  they don't unite at all ,  ¿right ? 
Right ,  but you know ,  i don't think so ,  i don't know how is it possible
um ,  right
that ,  uh ,  because something that ,  what the recording said was that ,  lets see ,  if every ,  if everyone in the world had one religion would they get along better or something like that
right ,  right
and i don't ,  i don't think it's possible for all the world to have one religion
Or get along better because of it ,  ¿right ?  ,  i think that inside ,  even inside a religion there's a lot of people that sees it one way and another people sees it differently
i look at myself ,  I'm catholic ,  i'm me ,  and there's people that says some things ,  and others believe more in ,  lets say the bible ,  others believe more in the spiritual part ,  i don't know
and things like that ,  like a religion from far away ,  ¿right ?  ,  like that one ,  the islam ,  or well ,  although there is a lot of people here in the United States now ,  ¿right ? 
well ,  i ,  i think that if you're from the same .  .  .  if you believe the same
um ,  right
with another person ,  so that unites
that there's compatibility ,  yes
but yes but when they are let's say the Christians and I don't remember what is called
mm ah
the people of ,  of how is it , 
of other religion ?  or of the Christians themselves ? 
no the Muslims
aha ,  yes the Muslims
that's it
aha
eh I think that you know of course that they are two completely different religions
sure ,  and what one believes the other doesn't understand ,  what the other believes this one doesn't agree with ,  I think
but also I think that even also ,  you know if one says that is Christian it could also be that they say they are Christians but they are you know
eh ,  yes ,  and beliefs and ,  and things and that
different churches or schools for example there the Pentecostal who have a different practice to ,  what could it be ?  to the Baptist ,  or the Catholic right ?  also are ,  and there are those who say no ,  I'm Christian and one tells them me too they say ,  no you are not Christian
you believe in the saints for example ,  the Jehovah witnesses have a lot of differences in their practice right ?  I think that religion is something to not even talk about because it gets in
brings problems right ?  for example at work one starts talking about that and well ,  one gets into um problems
I also think that it depends who you talk to
ah yes ,  that's true ,  of course
because ,  you know ,  I'm not going to talk about religion with someone ,  let's say at work ,  but if I'm talking with my husband or friends
you know I'm going to tell them what I believe and what I think
Well ,  yes ,  i know ,  exactly ,  that depends on the group you're with ,  however i see brothers that don't agree or ,  people very ,  tell me ,  well ,  sometimes wife and husband
They say the same but interpret it differently ,  ¿right ?  ,  for example ,  sometimes ,  um
And that's why i ,  i don't know ,  i ,  i ,  i think this is a very hard subject
very hard ,  i think so ,  we have to ,  we have to handle it softly
i think you know ,  yes ,  well no ,  but ,  but ,  it's also ,  it's very
too ,  very wide
yes ,  but ,  but i mean ,  i think that what i said before ,  that if someone you know ,  or you know ,  you want to explain to him what you know
uh
mm ,  right
it's something you can talk about with that person
Now ,  yes ,  in general terms i do like to listen ,  uh ,  for example ,  there are a lot ,  there is a channel of only religious talk from different parts ,  ¿right ? 
Um ,  right
well ,  from different churches ,  and ,  uh ,  i listen to that and i get relaxed ,  it makes me very easy because it's like they're all talking about things ,  well ,  that i understand ,  ¿right ? 
and well ,  i take it as some people that want to do some good for others and i think that's good ,  but there might be someone that hears something like that and says "what a mess ,  ¿what are they saying ?  ,  it's not like that" ,  and what not
Uh ,  um ,  it also depends on how you want to see it ,  ¿right ? 
Well ,  and also ,  and how it's presented too
exactly ,  exactly ,  ¿and have you been living there in Miami for long ? 
Uh ,  yes ,  almost ,  almost all my life ,  we came here when i was like five or six years old ,  that's when i moved
that's nice
when i went to college
Uh ,  that's nice
And when I got married ,  we were back ,  so ,  I was ,  like ,  5 ,  like 5 years
and did you studied a career ? 
yes ,  teacher
of ,  I'm a physiologist ,  and well ,  I graduated several years ago ,  but I have a validation here ,  and well ,  I really like my profession ,  now
I have realize that it helps ,  I mean ,  it's nice to help people ,  right ?  ,  an the teacher ,  imagine ,  how many kids you can guide for the rest of the life ,  right ? 
yes
and from which grade you started ? 
special education
Oh ,  that's cute ,  I mean ,  we are kind of related by physiology ,  and the part of kids that need special education and keep working ,  because I listen to many young ,  I think that
yes ,  I'm 36 ,  37 years old ,  I always forget
Oh ,  that's wonderful ,  you sound like a 23 , 21 , 22 year old ,  and you are ?  ,  if you have worked then no
yes ,  I worked for like 5 years and then I stopped working and I stayed ,  I started to stay at home with
With the baby
No ,  to take care of the house
okay
and then ,  after many years we had our first daughter and then in November we are having other baby ,  but we don't know what's going
congratulations
Thank you
and well ,  you are taking things quietly and that's fine ,  with out hurries
well
together ,  ¿right ?  ,  but if they're going to be ,  they're going to be of close age ,  ¿right ? 
yes ,  she's going to be twenty three months old when i give birth
Oh ,  that's so nice ,  god ,  god bless you ,  so they're going to be like that ,  of very close age ,  ¿right ? 
Yes
That's very good ,  so they can be little partners ,  i had only one son and he feels lonely and i imagine that ,  well it's always good to have more than one ,  ¿right ? 
Yeah ,  well we thought that we weren't going to have children so
Um ,  right
by the grace of God ,  in the year ,  in the year two thousand three i had my daughter ,  and after that i spoke to my husband and
you know ,  i said we're getting more ,  you know ,  we're getting older everyday
Um ,  uh
so we're going to see if we can have another ,  if god gives us another
Right ,  and it came fast
yes ,  very fast
Now ,  that's good ,  i like big families
Well
That's right and
Good afternoon
Hello Hi
How are you ?  Here's Norma from Atlanta Georgia . 
I'm Junior from New York . 
ah ,  okay ,  And what opinion do you have regarding what they just said ,  of religions ? 
Okay ,  What was ,  what was your topic ? 
ah ,  it was ,  if the religions unify ,  no .  What opinions do you have of the Christian or Muslim religions ? 
oh ,  my ,  my topic was marriage and said to talk about any thing . 
Ah ,  That's why they called you ? 
yes , 
Ah ,  yes because mine yesterday was marriage . 
yes eh ,  I was doing marriage already a whole week . 
yes
yes
And they told me to talk about the religions ,  so I don't know then . 
So ,  and ,  they also told me to talk about any thing
aha
Because ,  no ,  I didn't hear my topic ,  it just said to talk about anything with the participant . 
ah ,  okay . 
How old are you ? 
I
yes
Forty one
oh ,  I'm twenty three
Ah ,  you're young . 
yes ,  what do you do for work ? 
ah
What do you do for work ? 
Ah I don't ,  I stay here and take care of the kids at home . 
oh
I have two children ,  so I ,  my husband works and I
oh ,  I am a tattoo artist . 
You do tattoos ? 
yes
ah ,  okay
Do you have some ? 
No ,  no ,  no I don't really like them either . 
oh
Eh ,  not every person has their likes you know ,  there are people that love tattoos and everything but
yes I have more than one . 
No ,  others don't like it and I ,  I'm one of the people who are more or less mature and I don't ,  I don't like tattoos ,  I don't think
yes
Well there are exceptions of course ,  no . 
yes ,  I have more than one ,  but
hmm
a small thing that no one can see .   I have it down here Yeah
yes .   No ,  and I don't know people who have tattoos ,  for example there are people who go to my church
yes
No ,  they have tattoos ,  they have devotional tattoos with religious meanings but ,  they do have tattoos . 
yes and they also said that the religion said something about ,  the only thing I understood was about marriage and also sexual something like this right . 
Ah ,  they say ,  they said that ,  What do you think ,  for example ,  about the problem of homosexuality ? 
yes
that if ,  it was more ,  it was like more support if they were people from the same religion ,  I don't know what
It doesn't matter what religion they are if they go to
Sure ,  like I also think ,  each per  each religion has its own concept about homosexuality ,  the majority of religions don't accept it . 
yes but ,  if the person is going to do it ,  it will do it in any religion . 
aha
to me it doesn't matter if a woman wants another woman ,  another man wants another man . 
this doesn't matter to you
No ,  to you ? 
Oh
¿And does it bother you ? 
No ,  i ,  i mean ,  it's ,  it's a ,  a ,  it is against religion ,  it is against god's commandments ,  but i mean ,  each one ,  ¿right ?  ,  does their life ,  you know if
Yes ,  but ,  yeah ,  the ,  since you're older ,  well
Right
You're not going to do things .  .  .  but nowadays all the young girls
Um
That are growing up ,  that ,  i think like the age is now ,  at eighteen ,  sixteen years ,  seventeen ,  like that ,  they want to experiment ,  and they pick ,  they always pick a girl
Oh ,  ¿yes ?  ,  oh ,  i didn't know that
Yeah ,  i don't ,  i don't know if you would do that ,  or do it ,  or have done that ,  but a lot of girls have done it around here ,  that i know
I only to experiment ,  only out of curiosity
Yes ,  ¿would you do that ? 
Um ,  no ,  of course not ,  no ,  and yes probably because youth now have another ,  it's not like the youth before ,  no ,  youth now is completely ,  well ,  allegedly more ,  they say more liberated ,  but i don't think that liberation ,  you know
Uh um
They don't have a lot of guidance .  No ,  there's not much guidance over ,  regarding the powers or a spiritual guide ,  so they do what they want
Yes ,  but like they say ,  oh ,  about religion ,  if all of us were from the same religion
Uh um
That ,  then ,  maybe there wouldn't be ,  um ,  homosexuality ,  but it's the same ,  all of it ,  because catholics ,  if we were all catholics ,  there would be
Uh um
If we all were christian ,  there would be
Sure
If we are were Pentecostal ,  all of us .  What are you ?  what religion ? 
I am a ,  ee ,  of the Hare Krishna movement
What ? 
The Hare Krishna movement ,  I wonder if you have ever heard it
no ,  how is it in English ? 
Hare Krishna we say in English
Ari what ? 
Hare Krishna ,  Krishna is the name of God in Sanskrit language .   I wonder if you have ever seen some boys who shave their head and have a
Brown
yes they shave their head ,  they have a tiny tail in the back
like ,  like a monk
yes ,  like a ,  tail in the back and orange dresses
yes yes
or white
yes
Who go out to sing in the streets
yes
Have you ever seen them ? 
yes
Ah well ,  I belong to this religion . 
Oh ,  I'm Catholic
And we believe in karma each in reincarnation and in the law of karma ,  each person is born with a quantity you know of suffering and happiness
and according to the actions or reactions that you realize ,  positive or negative ,  has a reaction
yes ,  I'm Catholic ,  well
so ,  yes ,  aha
I don't know ,  I don't go to church either ,  but I believe in God and this ,  but I don't have to go to church to believe in God . 
Sure ,  this of course and each you know each ,  each God is already in the heart of each person . 
yes
And God knows ,  and God is in the form of Paramatma ,  what we call it , 
yeah
And is int he form ,  and God is a testament to your actions . 
hmm
So according ,  you have free will to do what you want ,  you're not a slave to God
hmm
God puts his laws ,  you know ,  gives laws so that one leads a correct life but you're not obligated to do it if you don't want to . 
hmm
No ,  this depends on everyone .   Not everyone knows that
yes
that negative and positive actions are done ,  so ,  he has his reactions . 
hmm
no ,  this is why many people ,  no ,  suffer different things ,  different classes suffer different things ,  but many times you don't understand why this happened ,  but the reaction the the activities that you realize ,  no . 
This is the same but I don't ,  I don't
hmm .   You never read about ,  well ,  I suppose that you've read the Bible once ,  or no ?  No
no no
Never ,  not even when you were younger ? 
Neither . 
Neith  your family never told you . 
No the only thing we did was ,  the baptism and that's it . 
ah ,  okay
I never went , 
Well ,  there's literature no ,  Chrisa ,  do ,  don't go outside
hmm
There isn't literature that ,  that explains about what the ,  the spiritual soul is really ,  and the eternal relationship that you have with God .   Hmm
Give me a second ,  give me a second ,  hello
yes
sorry ,  I had an important call . 
yeah ,  okay
yes well people pass by giving papers on this about God but I don't read them because , 
no ,  like you can ,  can like no one ,  it's the way ,  it's the inclination of each person ,  no . 
I don't know ,  yeah
Right ?  ,  every one ,  nobody forces you to be religious ,  to belong to a political party or different groups ,  ¿right ?  ,  that's in your heart ,  if you want to
Uh huh ,  uh huh
I dis ,  if i discover there's something else than this material world ,  or just ,  what you do all the time ,  eating ,  sleeping ,  defending yourself ,  it's always the same ,  there's something else that's
part of our spiritual life
And you ,  that you go to ,  you go to church every sunday ,  ¿right ? 
Yeah ,  on Sundays and when there are celebrations in my ,  in my temple
And do you ,  ¿do you wear a uniform or something ? 
Uh
¿Do you use like a special uniform or something ? 
Well ,  it depends on what the devotes wish to use ,  we use a sari ,  for example ,  the women use what's called sari
Uh huh
Right ?  ,  and the men use ,  it's called a sort of ,  it's called "doti" ,  with like a shirt called curta
Yes
And it depends on the members ,  if they want to use it every Sundays or on celebrations ,  nobody is forced to either ,  no
We have rules and regulations ,  for example ,  we're vegetarian ,  we don't eat meat ,  eggs ,  fish ,  no ,  no
other than ,  ¿you only eat what ? 
We don't eat meat ,  eggs or fish
Right
We don't ,  we're not vegetarians ,  we don't ,  we don't take drugs or drink coffee or tea ,  we don't gamble ,  no illicit sex ,  those are rules and regulations you have to follow
yes
No ,  but nobody is going to take care of you ,  no nobody is the guardian of ,  if one already wants to do spiritually then one does it it depends on each one if they do it or not . 
mm
No that ,  as ,  as I said ,  I'll repeat it again ,  no ,  God doesn't force anyone to do things that they don't want ,  one has free will . 
yes like I was talking with someone from ,  I think it was from Washington
Sure ,  no mm
And was telling me that they are like nudists . 
aha
that they don't use clothes . 
mm
it can be like that is they who do it ,  I don't know
yes I mean there are different groups of
I don't know . 
no ,  no ,  different groups of people that try to look for something different in their lives because they are tired of the daily life that is , 
yes here they don't do that ,  but I ,  And they do it over there ? 
Well ,  I don't know ,  no and one is always searching for something different in their lives . 
mm
No because that really is ,  that one is like a fish our of water . 
yes
That you're not in your own habitat ,  natural and good
Hello
Hello
Hi
Hi good evening ,  Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with ? 
eh I'm Nicole I live in New York
ah ,  Nicole is Silvia in Philadelphia ,  we speak
hi we speak again ,  it seems as if we're the only two
How is it going ?  yes that's what it seemed like right
how strange ,  I don't know ,  I haven't made any other calls ,  it's the only one I mean this one and the other one . 
ah really
we are the only ones yes
I don't know how normal it is to repeat with the same person ,  I find it a little strange
how weird ,  I don't know ,  have you talked to other people or not ? 
I spoke to two people in Connecticut
okay
that it caught my attention that people ,  that people from as far as Philadelphia find out about the study
mm ,  sure
and ,  and they told me they had talked to people in Miami
yes I ,  I believe they did a national study .  But I believe there must be people from all parts of the country . 
from ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes I believed that it was something ,  like the university of Pennsylvania is here where I'm at
Sure
I thought that they only recruited locally ,  but evidently they don't
No ,  it seems they don't
Yeah ,  well ,  so
uh ,  well ,  let's talk about religion this time ,  last time it was about marriage ,  now it's about religion
Yeah ,  it's more ,  yes
Uh ,  i don't know if you are religious or what do you think about religion
Yeah ,  and so ,  they tell you to talk about ,  if ,  if religions are divisive ,  if they create division
Right
between people ,  i am religious but more agnostic than anything else nowadays
Uh um
¿And you ? 
I'm not very religious ,  i mean ,  my parents didn't raise me with a lot of religion ,  so i am very interested ,  in fact i studied religions in college
As a study subject
Oh
and i don't know ,  i am attracted to the idea of practicing a religion ,  i don't ,  i mean i am attracted to like knowing more
Right ,  right ,  right
And i don't know ,  i think that
Like something ,  like something on a more abstract level ,  more than something to apply to your own life
Sure ,  well ,  i don't know ,  i would really like to have more religion in my life ,  but right now i don't feel like i am ready to prepare ,  i mean ,  to pick a religion
mm ,  mhm
as I was not ,  as I was not raised with a particular religion and my parents belong to different religions
oh ,  I see
I don't ,  I don't feel like I belong to any religion andI don't know which would be my religion if I decided to start practicing
aha ,  aha ,  and from what countries and religions are your parents ? 
well ,  my dad is Cuban
oh ,  oh
and ,  he is Catholic ,  not very Catholic but he is baptized and more or less Catholic ,  and my mom is
aha ,  aha
mm ,  Jewish ,  from New York ,  yes
oh
but none of them is very religious either ,  I mean ,  it's not that my dad is very Catholic and my mom very Jewish ,  non 
mhm mhm
none of them is very religious
mhmh ,  mhm ,  mhm
in
and is it to raise ,  well for instance ,  with other people that have raised in such homes ?  of a father ,  of parents being one Christian and the other Jewish
eh let's say in situations in which people practise more their religion ,  how do people feel being raised in such a home ? 
well ,  as I told you ,  my parents are not very religious
yes
religion was never a big part of my upbringing
yes
in other words I didn't get baptized and I hardly ever went to church or to the temple or synagogue or nothing
mm ,  mm ,  aha ,  aha
just the same we celebrate the holidays but more in a way to spend time together with the family not in a religious way ,  we celebrate Christmas just the same with the tree ,  with the gifts
aha ,  ah yes
with a meal but never going to church
aha ,  aha ,  aha
and ,  and also sometimes we celebrate the Jewish holidays too I mean sometimes we make a meal for Passover or we put candles for Hanukkah but
also not in a very religious way ,  like
aha ,  aha ,  mm
like with a ceremony or something fun ,  but not as something serious
aha ,  aha ,  aha , 
yes
like one says Thanksgiving that in reality has nothing to do with religion
sure ,  exactly ,  exactly ,  like
ah ,  something a bit like
like thanksgiving
ah
all the holidays are like that a meal ,  sometimes gifts sometimes a special meal but not something
mm
of ,  of ,  of praying and ,  I don't know anything about that
mm ,  mm ,  mm
so no ,  I don't know ,  it hasn't caused much conflict in my life ,  because I don't feel that my parents observe different things they simply don't observe
eh now I don't know I mean and also I was raised with people of many religions I mean yes  I was raised in New York and well there's of everything here
mm yes of course ,  yes
well in Philadelphia also obviously
aha , aha
I don't know when you were ,  were a girl eh your family was more religious or was it a big part of your upbringing or , 
eh well I spent my childhood in Cuba and of course my parents were both Catholics right ,  my father wasn't a practitioner at all
and my mom a little .  eh I never really knew
mm
eh what was my dad's religious idea I mean I never eh if I think about it now I don't know if he really
continued to believe in the Catholic faith ,  or if it was something that one says that I'm Catholic like one says my name is so and so . 
sure
eh in reality ,  I don't know .  Perhaps my mom I think more that she did continue believing in that
mm
eh I was raised in ,  in Cuba ,  I was in Catholic school
mm
and this was during the fifties and it was very
hmm
eh ,  eh ,  really to that old
hmm
eh ,  it was a really meticulous observation and I remember during my whole childhood ,  Sara Montiel became famous ,  I don't know if you've heard the name
hmm no
an in the movie musicals and she made the ,  really important ,  she made
hmm mm
the star of the moment ,  and all the kids had Sarita Montiel songs . 
hmm mm
And the ,  at school the nuns took the song from us
hmm
because it wasn't correct . 
hmm so those nuns were really strict , 
Eh ,  in ,  yes yes ,  so it was an environment ,  in reality it was a backwards Catholic environment . 
sure
Eh ,  what they have now is totally different . 
sure sure there's much more ,  I think that it's much more permissive now ,  it's it's much less strict ,  so
yes ,  yes ,  yes
like in the schools I don't know it depends a bit on the place yes maybe in certain parts perhaps it's really strict
But today in no school do they take songs from you from a popular singer . 
hmm
As if this is sinful . 
hmm
yeah this is something that doesn't happen anywhere . 
sure ,  sure
And and what do you think of the question if the diversity of religions creates divisions between people or ,  or brings them together ? 
hmm I ,  I think that it's a ,  this is a question of how one ,  one sees his religion uh ,  I think that people who see their religion as the only religion
and who haven't
good evening my name is Milder Martel and I live in Norwalk ,  Connecticut
ah my name is Norma and I live here in Georgia ,  in Atlanta ,  Georgia
eh do you have kids or ? 
ah yes yes I have two kids one is seven and the other is three and you ? 
I have five kids already adults
five and already big
yes yes the youngest is seventeen years old
ah okay
what religion and nationality are you ? 
ah I'm Peruvian and I'm a Krishna devout you know I belong to the Krishna movement
Krishna oh okay I'm Christian but I'm Catholic
aha and what country are you from ? 
aha Puerto Rican
ah you're from Puerto Rico ah yes
aha
already four times already I've just been talking with Puerto Ricans only
oh yes I've talked with Peruvian from Miami from New York
aha
and eh yes I talked with a Puerto Rican also ,  with just one the rest were from other countries
aha and what do you think about the religions that say that .  .  .  ? 
Well ,  i think that every one should have their religion ,  but ,  uh ,  i think ,  i don't believe these religions ,  neither the Muslim nor the Jewish unite any other because they are
believers that they are a special race and they're different
Oh ,  yes ,  oh yes ,  i don't have a lot of .  .  .  a lot of notion about those religions ,  but they like ,  now the Muslims are co related to terrorist attacks and something like that
They are like fanatics ,  ¿right ?  ,  they're
Yeah ,  very extremist ,  right
Right ,  they don't ,  it's like no ,  it's their religion and nobody else can go in there ,  you know
And ,  of course ,  yes ,  yes ,  that's not good
Because if we look at the ,  uh ,  these ,  this Hispanic guy that got into that religion ,  and i can say that he was kinda used for their purposes
in this country ,  but not ,  not because they really want to mix their race with their religion with other races
so ,  they ,  yes ,  they are very ,  like they use their religion for violence ,  it seems ,  ¿right ? 
Right ,  right
Yeah ,  they are very violent people ,  too passionate
Exactly ,  exactly
Everything based on their religion ,  they commit violent acts and i don't think god is
well ,  they don't respect life ,  exactly ,  they use god's name to
yeah ,  to do things that are negative
horrible ,  horrible ,  that killing children and killing beings
right
that are young and people that have nothing to do ,  that aren't guilty of their thoughts ,  well ,  i don't think that's right
Yes ,  they don't seem to have a very clear understanding about what their religion really is ,  because as far as i know ,  the
Muslim religion is that is that they have to respect life not that that each little living thing but it's just that they interpret it differently
yea and the the the the Jews they have their group too that are no realy strange the ones who won't marry outside of Jewidh people
uh yea
it'd be really strange if they got married to an American or a Hispanic ,  there's very few of them ,  maybe
mm yea
the majority of young people nowadays that that they have a different mentality and they grow up more here in the United States that the Jews wo live in Jerusalem and that keeps their ethnicity separate
uh huh
they don't don't try to mix with any other race or religion that isn't theirs like I'm Catholic and I respect everyone's opinions ,  their religion
yea
I don't don't try to like take my ideas to anyone I don't go crazy over it ,  I go to church but I don't go around all crazy like super involved at church ,  no
mm yea
I'm participate at church when they're special ocassions with family but I'm not I pray at home and I believe in God but no
I'm not about fanaticism like being at church all the time and I help people when I can and that's my religion to help
and cooperate with the community when I can that that you say you're part of the Hara Krisna
yea I'm part of Hara Krisna no we
in Puerto Rico there was a really large movement
ah yea you've seen the Krisna devotees
yes ,  Puerto Rico is but like in the sixties was when there was the most
uh huh uh huh
there were lots ,  lots of them in Puerto Rico
yes we have a temple ,  a temple here on a farm in Puerto Rico
oh yes
where there are devotees
Ohh ,  have you been ? 
no ,  not us ,  no Puerto Rico ,  I don't here ,  I was a devotee in my country in Peru but I came here in ninety five for a way
and you see them with the togas and everything ,  with the tunics ,  or do they not dress like that anymore
yes and ,  like I dressed like that too when I go to temple above all no
hmm and what is what is what I no no I but I went to sing and I liked the songs and I get together with them to dance but not
you also liked to dance
yes because aha aha
yes many people are attracted to this
yes I liked their music a lot and where they stood to us like little kids so in the end we
aha
started to jump with them and play the tambourine and
hmm
but I never was interested to know really what type this religion was involved in or anything
aha
like what ,  what their belief was ,  what they believed
oh no ,  we have regular principles ,  we are vegetarian ,  we don't eat meat ,  eggs ,  fish ,  we don't drink alcohol ,  or tea ,  or cafe .   We don't get high on drugs or
we don't gamble or have illicit sex
Why do you shave your head ? 
shaving the head is like a symbol of surrender to the spiritual master not a sign of renunciation used by devotees . 
It is used as a rule especially when they march and his devotees
mm okay
No no ,  because the devotees that are married have the option to continue
Ohh
if they wish they can keep their hair a little big . 
Oh okay ,  I thought everybody had to shave
It is not a rule that all must shave
I thought that was rule
especially if you live in a temple right ? 
Why did you get into that religion ? may be your husband or someone you knew
I got into this religion because I like it ,  they try to develop their religion . 
in supreme personality of god Krishna is the name of God in language we lead a materialistic life and religion does not
It is to the service of Krishna ,  Everything we do it relates to it .  Even when we cook . 
Cocinamos todo y le damos la comida a Krishna ,  en honor a Dios ,  antes incluso de probarlo . 
You try to do it with devotion ,  then you are going to provide food to Krishna
ahh ,  All the food and everything we do is for him . 
He uses everything we do . 
and Why do you eat Meat ? 
no ,  we don't eat meat ,  we are vegetarian ,  we are lactic vegetarian
ohh
and we don't drink milk ,  yogurt ,  cheese and those things
you don't eat ,  you don't eat milk and yogurt ? 
no ,  any kind of .  .  we are lactic vegetarian
oh OK oh ,  oh ,  and children too ,  the same for all
yes ,  my kids are still little ,  and they are vegetarian since the day they were fathered and till now ,  afterwards I don't know ,  when they grow up
when they are teenagers they will be able to decide
aha
we raise them
so if some of your children decided to opt on another religion
and I ,  well what can you do ?  right ?  every soul is spiritual and has free will ,  you can't force a kid or a person
to do what they don't want to do ,  the service you develope for God must be volunteer
aha aha
no ,  you can't force nobody t odo something ,  because if ,  if ,  if you do some service by force then it's not sincere
aha
you can't oblige the person or he'll become frustrated ,  rebel ,  right ?  and renounce his believe or the ,  the way of life he is having ,  I mean ,  it's something natural ,  it comes from the heart
sure ,  sure ,  that's what I think also ,  that's why I don't think
aha ,  no
ahh ,  I am Catholic and raised my kids into the Catholic religion but my daughter goes to the Evangelist church
see other churches and no
hmm
like if someone invites me to another church I wouldn't say no ,  I don't believe in this and this isn't ,  no
hmm
like I only go to see what kind of religion it is
aha
but then after you can make an opinion ,  well up until now I feel really good in the Catholic religion and I don't
Well
Good afternoon ,  my name is Milgred and I live in Northwalk Connecticut
Hello ,  good afternoon ,  my name is Nadia and I'm from Philadelphia . 
Um ,  how many kids do you have ? 
Ah ,  I'm twenty one . 
Oh ,  oh ,  okay . 
I'm studying in the university here .   Hmmm ,  yes . 
I imagine that you like music a lot . 
Yes yes ,  here we listen to it a lot .   I like I like everything .   And now that I'm not in Mexico ,  for example ,  I'm from Mexico , 
Uh huh
I've was listening to much more music there .   I really like to dance salsa ,  and here there pretty much isn't any ,  so this as been something really important to me . 
And where are you living ? 
I've been trying in Philadelphia . 
Eh on Philadelphia ,  ah
Hmmm I live ,  where I am ,  the ,  my friends ,  well they almost never listen to music ,  and they don't dance
yes ,  be 
more ,  more hip hop or something
Oh
well yes ,  yes I miss it . 
Ah
That's why And you ? 
Oh ,  I'm Puerto Rican ,  I love salsa ,  merengue ,  all ,  all types of music I like
Hm mm
is important because it unites all nations ,  besides it keeps us happy and
yes
like you say ,  with not being in your country ,  it keeps like the memories from your country ,  from your people ,  from your land ,  from your customs , 
Hm mm
all .  Only
yes ,  besides it has a lot of memories always right .  A song always brings back memories .  That's what happens to me a lot .  I hear a song
Aha Aha
and I remember something that happened several years ago that had that song . 
Sure ,  music is nice .  It never matters the type of music it is ,  because for the rockers ,  well ,  for them that is
Hm
good music ,  for us well maybe the romantic music ,  the salsa ,  the cumbia ,  the
Hm ,  hm
what music do they dance to in your country ?  what is it called what you dance ? 
Here in Mexico ,  well the same . 
Aha
We like Salsa ,  cumbia ,  merengue a lot and also a lot the band music ,  in the North ,  which is very different
Aha ,  the band music ,  yes the band music is very pretty ,  aha
yes ,  the Mexican folk songs are interesting ,  yes ,  before ,  before I didn't like them ,  but now I've learn to appreciate them . 
To appreciate it . 
yes ,  what's good here ?  The drug ballads are good . 
yes ,  in the music   nice ,  I like Mexican music a lot
yes ,  the total
also because it has a lot especially ,  this man Aguilar ,  I love him . 
Hm mm ,  Aguilar
His music fascinates me .  Aguilar ,  and I also like the other young guy .  This , 
yes ,  this ,  Fernandez . 
Aha .  aha
yes ,  that's it ,  he's very popular ,  lately ,  right . 
yes ,  he has beautiful music . 
He's becoming very famous .  Everywhere
I like a lot Mark Anthony and I like
Hm mm
 J Lo ,  I like English music ,  I don't like too much ,  rock I like to listen to it for a little bit but I don't like it for too long ,  because
there comes a time when I get tired of the same song
And does Reggaeaton bore you or not ? 
I do listen to Reggeaton ,  and ,  I also dance to it ,  because my daughter is always here with the ,  the Reggeaton music the whole day ,  since she's young ,  she's seventeen years old , 
really ?  Hm mm
well ,  she loves to dance reggaeton ,  and listen to her music ,  she likes hip hop reggaeton a lot ,  and she plays a lot of music there ,  the other is ,  that they have words that ,  talk ugly ,  that i don't like
Yes
yes ,  i don't like that
yes ,  I'm still getting used to it .  But before i didn't like it at all ,  i mean i don't like the lyrics and i don't like very much how people dances ,  nothing
No ,  but there are some that have ,  some that are ,  you know ,  a little bit more normal .  They sound ,  the music sounds prettier .  At least it says ,  it has a little bit more meaning
Uh huh ,  yes ,  yes
Because now there's ,  the ,  most of the songs they sing ,  well they have profane words and they also say ,  they don't say anything ,  they don't tell a beautiful love story ,  like the songs were before ,  it's nothing romantic ,  it's nothing
Well ,  yes ,  like you can't dedicate songs ,  ¿right ? 
It's all sex .  Right ,  right
That used to be done too
No ,  not now ,  the composers ,  like they don't have much imagination ,  the music imagination is like very
Oh yes ,  yes ,  the bad thing here is that ,  well ,  everybody listens to hip hop and that's practically all they listen to
Right ,  right
And if i can't ,  i go to parties ,  and after one hour I'm tired ,  i mean i need something different
Yes ,  yes ,  right
I ,  i don't like that ,  i also don't like the way they dance it .  So i can't dance with anyone ,  yeah ,  it's very complicated
Right
That's why i miss so much the music from there ,  yes ,  like that ,  like dancing salsa is very different ,  i think
Oh ,  yes ,  oh yes
But ,  i also like a lot of international .  Like rock ,  i love it ,  and Hindu music is very interesting , 
yes ,  it's pretty . 
It's going ,  it's about to go out ,  yes . 
Aha ,  it's pretty ,  it's very ,  very ,  the Chines music ,  it's also
yes
they have ,  you know ,  they have music to relax ,  it's more ,  more . 
Hm mm
It's not dance music ,  it's music to relax ,  to be at home or if you have guests for dinner ,  things like that ,  their music is more like Indian music ,  they
their music is nice ,  but it's also
Quiet ,  right ? 
yes ,  it's a bit quiet ,  ours is more aggressive ,  active ,  it gives you energy . 
yes
Or at least ,  when I play merengue or salsa and I'm cleaning the house I finish quickly ,  I think I'm following the music's rythm . 
yes ,  that happens to me too ,  I can't be sit ,  I can't stay quiet if they play something like that ,  so ,  in order to talk to someone you need to decide ,  no ,  no ,  when one starts you can't
talk you can't it's not your fault ,  I just can't . 
Aha
But yes ,  it's more
well
But the music ,  I listen to ,  it's weird because here ,  you don't well people don't want to ,  mm ,  people don't want to talk about that but I really like classical music . 
Oh yes
So ,  I really like it ,  in Mexico I used to go to a lot of concerts ,  for example ,  and I used to play the guitar and I used to be with friends that played the piano and other instruments . 
Hmmm yes ,  I really like piano . 
And it's very different . 
Piano ,  ah ,  the piano and the alto are my favorite instruments ,  and the conga . 
yes ,  yes it's really pretty . 
Aha
But here I don't know because everyone ,  only adults buy this and the people who are over seventy . 
So ,  well almost no one ,  none of my friends have it .   It's bad
Or if they hear you listening to it ,  they say you're old
Hmmmm
Or you're not into anything ,  they say
yes
They say ,  aye ,  you're old ,  what happened to you with this music ,  but this music is really beautiful too ,  I like it ,  old music to me is the best . 
Precious .   You have more variety ,  more feeling .   Hey ,  the writers were
And now ,  sorry
Aha
Now you're living in Puerto Rico or San Juan or where ? 
Sorry ? 
Where are you living now ? 
I live here in Northwalk Connecticut ,  in the state of Connecticut . 
but in what part ? 
In Northwalk ,  it's called Northwalk like walk of the north ,  in Spanish . 
Ah ,  okay
Aha ,  yes ,  here ,  here there are very few dance halls ,  there are like three ,  no more I would say ,  eh ,  places where you can dance to Hispanic music . 
Oh yeah ? 
If you want to dance to good music you have to go to New York to find good Hispanic music ,  in New York
Hmmm
But here ,  there aren't many places .   The most there are are some clubs ,  of American music ,  rock n roll ,  hip hop
this ,  they don't have Reggaeton either . 
yes ,  well yes . 
they don't play a lot ,  at least not like
Ah well yes ,  hmm
when you go to your family's house ,  when ,  when they have a party ,  so you listen to the Reggaeton ,  but the ,  they mostly have rap . 
Hip hop and reggae but dark ,  of ,  of American . 
Hmmm ,  hmmm
Not Hispanic .   There aren't many Hispanic places to dance here . 
yes yes yes
So I almost always ,  we almost always go to the Bronx to find Latin music . 
Here too . 
Aha
yes yes ,  well yes ,  here ,  I'm also here .   I go back to Mexico every now and then ,  and I buy a lot of CDs . 
In the capital are only my friends ,  to be able to do this ,  because here there's nothing .  yes ,  they say they have like two radio stations
but they are also not the best there is .  So then yes ,  like you get tired of it .  But I like it a lot
Here where I'm at ,  I put it to dance the Hispanic music on  MTV that plays a variety of music ,  there .  Is where
They play it there ?  Because I sometimes see it ,  but it's always pure hip hip That's why it is that

Well ,  you speak .   What ,  what country are you from ,  Carmen ? 
From Puerto Rico . 
Ah ,  nice ,  hmm . 
And you ? 
I'm Cuban . 
Okay .   What do you think about marriage ? 
Ay ,  me with every year that passes I feel more pessimistic about marriage . 
Aha .   Why ? 
yes .   Because I observe that in life ,  in the end ,  men don't treat women well . 
Aha ,  they want to rule over her . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  and I think that
Aha . 
that a things is ,  when they want to conquer someone ,  that then
Aha . 
everything's really nice
Everything ,  everything is pink . 
yes ,  yes ,  everything's pink and they don't do it for one ,  and after when you're in a relatinoship
Aha ,  aha . 
They treat you as if you were a rag . 
Aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  How long have you been married ? 
No ,  I'm divorced . 
Oh ,  but you were ? 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
Ma 
And I've had various people since then ,  but the same thing always happens . 
Aha ,  aha ,  yeah .   Oh ,  well I've been married for thirty years ,  thank God ,  and no ,  it's
Ah . 
because ,  to say that ,  that I'm happy ,  but thank God I have a really understanding husband ,  ah ,  he takes me everywhere ,  we both go out
he never goes out alone and I never go out alone . 
Ah ,  well how nice ,  what a really nice marriage . 
Thank God ,  yes ,  thank God .   But it's true what you say ,  the ,  eh ,  some men want to live from the woman ,  they don't work
they stay at home and want ah ,  the wife to work on the street and bring him the money and they live off her and in the neatest style
yes . 
to shine for another . 
yes ,  I've never found myself like this ,  what I've found is that ,  that they all think that they will lose the other
Aha . 
that the concept of making someone happy
Aha . 
ceases to exist
Aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha
and that one tells them ,  don't do this stop doing this ,  I dislike this a lot ,  and they could care less . 
They keep on doing it . 
yes ,  same ,  same ,  same ,  They already have us ,  and we become like a rag . 
Ah .  aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  it's true .  Very true what you are saying .  And where did you meet your husband ? 
Eh mm he ,  I'm Cuban ,  he's Guatemalan and I met him in a trip I made to Guatemala . 
Aha .  Aha . 
And ,  at the end ,  from there everything happened .  And you ,  eh ,  did you meet your husband in Puerto Rico or
No ,  I met him here in Chicago ,  in his brother's house . 
Ah . 
We met ,  we fell in love and we were dating for a year and then we got married . 
Ah ,  how nice . 
yes ,  thank God . 
Mm .  I have here eh I live near a university and I have a guy from Chicago
Aha . 
here ,  that goes to the university that he's living with me
Oh ,  really . 
because since I have four extra rooms
Aha . 
then ,  eh ,  now this year I received some students
Oh . 
and ,  and he is ,  eh ,  from Mexican descent
Aha . 
eh ,  but he's from Chicago ,  so he talks to me about Chicago . 
Oh .  You are like ,  like he's sharing the apartment ,  the room ,  the apartment with you or what ? 
No ,  is ,  is a four bedroom house
Aha . 
and since my kids are already big
Aha . 
then eh ,  this year I accepted having three students living here .  that ,  that
Oh ,  you rented to them . 
Eh ? 
You rented to them . 
yes ,  exactly . 
Oh ,  okay ,  okay ,  okay .  But are they good kids ? 
yes ,  they are good kids ,  yes ,  yes . 
Mm . 
yes ,  and especially this guy ,  look Latin you know that he's a person with a better heart
Aha . 
More generous and more noble . 
Mm .  Mm
eh ,  definitely of the three that I have eh ,  that one ,  that one is the best person
Oh ,  okay ,  okay . 
and I have a Chinese girl there that I want to kick back to China .  Get her out of the house
Look ,  then ah mm .  Oh ,  and do you have kids ? 
I have three ,  yes ,  yes . 
Oh ,  women and men ? 
Eh ,  a woman and two men ,  eh ,  she finished college already and my two sons are
Mm . 
they are in their last years of college . 
Wow .  I have a twenty eight year old daughter
Ah . 
that's working and a son who's twenty six who's also working . 
Aha ,  aha .  How nice ,  so they're all grown up already and ,  and
yes ,  thank God ,  yes . 
and they are already formal people . 
Aha ,  aha ,  aha , aha ,  aha . 
yes ,  that gives one so much ,  so much happiness ,  right ? 
Aha ,  but I have friends that's it's going really bad in their marriage .  Really bad ,  really bad ,  really bad . 
Oh ,  to girl friends
Yes ,  girl friends because ah ,  mm ,  they look for people who ,  who ,  ah ,  when you ,  like you said ,  when you first meet them they are one thing
That's it
and when they have already set up a home ,  they are another
Absolutely ,  yes
different one ,  they change so much ,  so much ,  and my friend says that she is suffering a lot in her marriage and he don't give her a good life ,  that he wants her to
work and give him all the money
MM
and he ,  just wander around the streets ,  well ,  well dressed and well ,  with a nice car
Oh
but it's true ,  marriage nowadays ,  you have to know who you choose
Look I am sure that if you look at couples who have been married for twenty years or more ,  half of
Aha ,  aha
those married couples just keep on
Aha
because if they divorcea
Aha
they will destroy their whole life and will have to start over again ,  and they just don't feel like
Aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha
I am sure convinced that half of the marriages are actually dead
Aha ,  aha . 
Eh ,  because is that the ,  I see that ,  that people don't treat each other good now .  The men will say is because the woman doesn't treat
the man well ,  I ,  from the woman's perspective
Mm . 
I see the situation more where the man is the one that abuses
Aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha . 
and ,  and one sees too much abuse . 
Aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha .  And one cannot put up with that abuse that they give you
No ,  no ,  no ,  no
because one that ,  that it's verbal abuse ,  an example or ,  or psychological abuse
yes ,  mm ,  mm
and ,  and if you have small kids that's not right that you stay with a man so ,  so that the kids don't suffer
Aha . 
one has to look out for your kids and see to ,  to where one can get in the marriage . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
But it's true ,  there are some people that ,  women that put up and put up and put up until they can't take any more . 
yes ,  speaking of the kids ,  I remember that once I read something that ,  that in the United States many times
Aha . 
eh ,  a situation is given that the woman ,  when the last kid leaves to college I mean ,  suddenly tells their husband ,  I'm getting a divorce . 
Aha ,  Aha ,  aha ,  aha . 
And he says ,  "And from this where did it come out ? " And it's that
Uh huh ,  uh huh . 
that she had been telling him for years to please change this or change the other thing ,  change beyond ,  and
uh huh ,  uh huh . 
It had ,  the moment came that she understood that he was never going to change and so then the idea came along of finally leaving
so that's where I'm going to go ,  I'm going to get a divorce ,  and she spent time making a plan
uh huh . 
of ,  of ,  the moment came to throw the man out of the house . 
But the man didn't ,  he didn't expect this
no ,  and he didn't expect it ,  and everything ,  and so everything that she says ,  please don't do this ,  I don't like this ,  and all of this isn't
nothing made an impact on him that this was important ,  the
Hm
point when she finally said ,  no ,  I'm getting a divorce
uh huh . 
It was a great surprise to him . 
No ,  and that ,  and that ah ,  you tell your spouse ,  for example ,  change ,  or I'm going to leave one of these days ,  and they laugh
yes ,  no ,  they don't believe you . 
uh huh .  They laugh until ,  until it reaches the ,  ah ,  until at last one can't stand it any more and can't stand more of anything and when you ,  when you throw them out ,  then they say
it's true ,  we were talking seriously when you told me you were going to throw me out ,  uh huh . 
And you know something ?  They never learn their lesson
Aha ,  aha . 
Because if you return with them . 
Aha . 
they won't say the little I lost ,  I have to be careful ,  they will say
Aha . 
these women ,  they talk a lot
Aha . 
and in the end no
They don't do anything . 
they don't do anything
Aha ,  aha ,  aha . 
but ,  the only way is that one really has to leave is and only then learn ,  but then the beneficiary is another woman . 
Aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  no ,  they say ,  how is it ?   they never know what they have until they lose it . 
Exactly ,  but the beneficiary is another ,  and the only one who can say well ,  hopefully I'll be the beneficiary . 
Aha . 
of ,  of the lesson that another woman gave to some man . 
Aha ,  aha ,  aha .   But if it keeps being the same ? 
yes ,  no ,  if it stays the same ,  it's useless ,  yes ,  yes . 
Because there's a saying that says that the woman makes the man ,  no ? 
yes . 
because you can get together with a man who's a womanizer who's a ,  gambler but if you treat him right and you talk to him and you talk to him and you talk to him
you do it your way
Mm . 
to your mold
Look ,  that
but there are some
hard ,  I remember that twenty ,  thirty years ago ,  I heard a
Aha
read Anne Landers
Aha . 
that said take the men as you see them
Aha . 
don't think that you'll like him if you manage to change this or the other of him or the other thing there
Aha . 
because people in general do not change ,  you decide if you love him or not ,  based on what you have before you
Aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha . 
and look ,  that is so true . 
Aha . 
people don't change
But
and ,  and over all ,  if you believe the same goes ,  because the woman doesn't leave unless ,  unless there are changes
uh huh .  But it's true ,  he ,  he ,  for me ,  for me ,  ah ,  the man ,  when ,  when he loves you ,  it's true that he ,  he sees everything through rose colored glasses . 
he opens the door for you before you get in the care ,  he pays when he takes you to a restaurant ,  you don't have
yes
Bessy
Hello
Hello
eh ,  How are you ? 
fine And you ? 
eh ,  fine ,  my name is Brenda
Nice to meet you ,  my name is Bessy
Bessy ,  from ,  from Where are you from ? 
yeah ah I'm from El Salvador but I live in Canada
ah
And you ? 
I'm in ,  in in Virginia Beach ,  Virginia in the United States . 
oh ,  how nice . 
aha ah ,  so and Well ,  from Salvador ,  How do you listen to music over there ? 
ah ,  good ,  since I have a computer
ah
I can listen to Spanish or English music . 
aha
But I like Spanish the most because it's more romantic . 
mm
Okay And you ? 
Well here there are many Hispanics ,  but
mm
we don't have a totally Spanish station . 
In Spanish really ? 
sometimes I think before we had a station ,  and it was more ,  the music they would play was more Mexican
mm
and ,  and it was only during certain days and up to a certain hour . 
mm ,  okay
So then we have to ,  buy the  CDs or record the music or how you do it that you get it through the computer . 
okay mm
but on the radio ,  no ,  there's not much and then is in the ,  in the  AM and you can't hear it too good . 
in ,  aha ,  yes oh ,  how strange . 
yeah
because I want to see ,  like two years ago my husband and I went to Florida . 
mm
for our honeymoon and we found a station in the car . 
mm
that was only in Spanish ,  but I don't remember what it was called . 
yes Because in those areas there are a lot of Cubans ,  a lot of Hispanics
aha
well they have the stations with much more ,  mm they have more variety in Spanish . 
ah okay because ,  aha
since I was raised in New York ,  over there they have like three or four stations that are Spanish . 
mm
and one can hear and they have more concerts in Spanish ,  here they hardly have any . 
oh ,  in Virginia you hardly have anything . 
aha The majority are in English . 
mm
and also there are a few discos that ,  that play Spanish music ,  so then one ,  one goes to the discos . 
aha ,  and there's one disco ,  in Spanish or let's say Spanish and English . 
eh ,  there's one that's in a hotel
aha
and that one is totally in Spanish ,  and I heard the other day that they opened another ,  that is only in Spanish . 
oh ,  how nice .  since I like Spanish music better . 
mm yeah
Okay and in English do you like any music in English ? 
in ,  in English yes ,  but I like to listen to it ,  you know ,  it's been a long time that I don't listen to music in English to go dancing . 
aha
Tuesdays I go salsa dancing . 
ah how nice . 
eh ,  it's nothing
yeah
so ,  now here ,  there's a place to dance salsa so with the key ,  and dancing the one and two and many things . 
yeah
hmm hmm but there's ,  there's some classes that teach you to dance salsa . 
yeah ,  we have this here ,  eh ,  night clubs and
aha
there's a lot of Canadian people there
hmm
who would like to learn
hmmmm
to dance salsa . 
hmmm
and there's a lot ,  they don't know how to dance ,  but , 
hmm
they are lively ,  yeah
aha ,  yes ,  here there are many Americans some of them are dark , 
hmm
they're attending the class ,  the classes , 
mm
in the discos they are free . 
oh ,  how nice . 
yes ,  so ,  then they can go and they have their drink ,  and dance and learn and they stay ,  you know they have a ,  a fun night . 
aha ,  that's good because like that they learn to dance and even if it's free . 
yes
It's good that ,  that is free and they can
mm yes
dance all they want
aha and it's during the week ,  is on eh ,  Thursdays
aha
so then ,  it like breaks up the ,  the week ,  you know ,  because sometimes there are people that work on the weekends and can't go out
yes it's true . 
so ,  so ,  they go ,  on Thursdays and there you know they have fun . 
mm yes What other type of music do you like ? 
Well my son likes rap ,  but I don't , 
oh
ah ,  I like ,  sometimes the ,  like the beat ,  the key ,  of the music but the words ,  I don't know ,  they are too ,  I don't understand too much what they are saying
Yes It's true
so then you know ,  eh I like a little bit black people music , 
mhm like reggae
oh ,  mm ,  no ,  not reggae ,  more like Rhythm and Blues
oh ,  aha ,  I see
that ,  that is this one you can dance but it's not too fast or too slow ,  you know
yes ,  aha
so ,  I listen to the American radio stations because there is nothing else
I see
around here there is nothing else
mhm
so ,  but I have my Hispanic records and that's what I listen to in my car
Oh ,  I see ,  aha ,  yes it's better like this because otherwise
right , 
a stations ,  let's figure you only like Spanish
mhm aha
And if there is not a station only in Spanish ,  then
yes
yes ,  here there is one that play Spanish music two hours a day only
oh
and the rest is Chinese or
oh
another language ,  I don't know
mm
When I put it and they are speaking in Chinese I say ok ,  it's over
mhm
There's only two hours
mm oh
but ,  the Chinese one lasts forever
I have never heard a Chinese station ,  eh ,  eh ,  I've seen it on TV but never on the radio
I have ,  and sometimes you can hear some very nice music playing on that station
mhm
And I say ,  oh how nice ,  but ,  but I don't understand ,  afterwards it's Chinese
aha ,  yes
you can hear nice music but you can't understand a thing
aha ,  yes
really ,  yes
ye ,  but the Indian music
mhm
of the ,  what is it ?  Indians from India
mhm ,  oh ,  mh
their music is sometimes ,  it's nice also
yes ,  is true . 
I've heard little about them ,  um
yes ,  you can't understand anything but , 
aha ,  yes aha
it makes you feel like dancing ,  yes is true . 
so then ,  here and sometimes I have to ,  because since I was raised in New York already
mm
when I go to New York ,  my mom tells me who has new records ,  who is ,  popular and like that she tells me who
aha ,  your mom also likes music . 
aha ,  yes
ah how nice ,  my mom too . 
yes because she's over there in New York ,  over there you hear the Spanish radio all day . 
ah ,  okay ,  okay
over there all day and a few stations ,  you have the Mega ,  and that ,  is big over there
aha ,  and there are more Hispanics over there than where you are at or
oh Oh ,  yes there are a lot of Hispanics because since this is a military area . 
oh ,  okay
Then there are a lot ,  eh , a lot of people from many areas . 
mm
and there are a lot of Hispanics ,  a lot of Mexicans ,  because they open up their restaurant businesses
hmm
so there's a lot of them there and many Puerto Ricans . 
hmm
and this ,  well ,  I have a friend who's El S Salvadorian . 
El Salvadorian ,  ah
aha yes he's a plumber . 
oh , 
so I met him here ,  but he's from New York . 
he ,  he's from New York ,  oh . 
aha ,  he's from New York ,  but since the military well he stayed there . 
oh
Like ,  this is what a lot of people do ,  since they're in the military . 
hmm
they're stationed somewhere and they stay . 
yeah
They get used to it and they stay ,  but Hispanic music ,  here they tried once to put on a station but it didn't happen ,  they gave up . 
ah ,  and ,  and
it seems that many people started talking because they didn't play much salsa ,  they wanted salsa and they played
oh
a lot of cumbia and merengue and Mexican . 
aha ,  they should be this ,  ah ,  what's it called ?   Not be discussing . 
this ,  of aha ,  of
Let's say ,  they put on a little bit of salsa ,  a little bit of cumbia ,  a little bit of romantic music ,  like this . 
hmm
Let's say a romantic one ,  then a salsa ,  then a cumbia or something like that . 
aha
yes aha like this
it's like this in ,  in New York ,  they play a little bit of everything . 
hmm ,  yeah it should be like this .   So no one is fighting ,  yeah . 
hmm all this like dividing the time . 
hmm
Everyone can have their time . 
yeah ,  yeah it's true
And I think that one day ,  like Fridays they had from four to from four to eight had like salsa ,  both an hour . 
aha
But I don't know ,  I don't know what happened . 
Then they stopped . 
Hmm ,  they stopped and now there's not anything . 
and ,  and who play it ?   The Hi  Hispanics
aha ,  they were Hispanics that played it ,  but
Hispanics oh ,  mm
No ,  I don't know ,  maybe they need ,  needed this what do you call it ,  sponsors
yes ,  aha ,  maybe ,  yes
aha ,  because they had you know a lot of commercials but
mm
no ,  I don't know ,  I didn't hear why they removed it . 
maybe there weren't enough ,  sponsors I sometimes like
Hello ? 
Yes ,  Hello ? 
Hello ,  yes .   My name's Tammy . 
Ah ,  my name's Alex ,  eh ,  I'm here in Los Angeles .   And you ? 
I'm here in Seattle
In Seattle ? 
yes . 
Where are you from ? 
I'm from Panama .   And you ? 
An ,  from Colombia ,  from a long time ago . 
Ah ,  okay .   Yes ,  I've been here for what ?  fifteen years . 
Uh ,  like thirty for me . 
Well .   And what do you think about music today ? 
Well ,  more than anything now ,  since I've been here awhile ,  I listen to almost everything in English .   I like music from the seventies ,  disco .   Old school
yes ,  me to .   Sometimes I play Spanish music ,  because I remember when my mom heard the music in Panama ,  when I was little . 
Oh ,  yes .  yes . 
So ,  but ,  it's the ,  music now isn't as good . 
Ah ,  sometimes I listen to ballads in Spanish . 
Ah ,  yes .   The old ballads ? 
Old ,  but more than anything it's too remember
Aha . 
Rejected courtships . 
Exactly . 
yes . 
You hear a lot of this too .   I like to hear the ballads that he makes ,  aye ,  I forgot the name of the guy . 
yes . 
Aye ,  he's Mexican .   I forgot .   Ah ,  aye ,  yeah I forgot ,  I can't remember .    But there are some ,  yes ,  some are so beautiful .   They're different ,  I have my son who's learning Spanish , 
yes . 
I tell him ,  ah ,  sit down and listen to them ,  these ballads ,  so you see how different the songs in English and Spanish are ,  the feeling
that they put in the songs ,  compared to what they have in English that's only
yes ,  they're very sentimental songs ,  but ,  they can make you sad and mad when you listen to them . 
Hmm ,  it's true . 
Because ,  they make me remember bad times .   Well ,  I identify the song with deception
Ah . 
I had a lot of deception in Colombia .   A lot of rejected relationships .   And ,  I got mad .   I got angry ,  yes . 
No ,  these things remind me more of my mom . 
And when I listen to it ,  it makes me remember and I get very mad . 
And you have to change the music from one time or you're only sitting there listening to it ,  weighing everything . 
yes ,  but ,  many of these songs are ,  it's music that isn't only music ,  but themes of life . 
Hmm ,  it's true . 
And things that happen to you ,  that happen to you in life .   So ,  it's more than just dancing music .   They are topics from real life . 
It happens or you've seen it happen to other people ,  that you can identify with them .   This is true . 
yes .   I don't like modern music much .   No ,  well I ,  I'm a man and I'm forty two .   And ah ,  well ,  I don't consider myself old ,  or anything like that . 
No ,  I'm thirty seven ,  I don't think I'm old either . 
But ,  I don't like the new music ,  it ,  it doesn't have feeling . 
No ,  no ,  the same . 
It's not the same .   No ? 
No ,  like it doesn't have ,  they didn't take the time to sit and write the ,  what you hear ,  or it's faster .   They're always putting out albums
really quickly ,  with whatever ,  it's not the same . 
Yes ,  there was a Mexican singer that I loved .   He sang only b ballads . 
yes . 
He was really popular in Colombia ,  well ,  in all of Latin America ,  I don't remember the name . 
Me neither .   The one I was remembering was saying that ,  that he things the old songs ,  but he's young ,  is Luis Miguel .   What do you think
Ay ,  I think it's Luis Miguel ,  yes . 
Aha .   Who has these songs ? 
It's marica . 
Aha . 
in life ,  but he has really real songs . 
yes . 
yes ,  yes and also another Venezuelan .   What's his name ?   The Puma . 
The Puma ,  I haven't heard of him .   I'm old . 
Jose Luis . 
Jose Luis Rodriguez . 
yes . 
the other that I haven't hear too is the ga   Iglesias .   Enrique Iglesias . 
yes ,  the ,  eh ,  Iglesias he ,  well ,  he's old . 
Aha . 
Not him ,  not the young one . 
No ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  yes ,  not Enrique ,  no Enrique ,  Enrique is the you  the young one . 
He's young . 
Julio Iglesias . 
yes . 
Julio Iglesias ,  this is ,  yes ,  he's
He also has a lot of ballads . 
yes .   He has pretty songs .   I also like salsa ,  the merengue . 
I don't like this very much . 
I like to listen to it . 
Because ,  it also makes me remember bad times .   yes ,  because ,  I ,  I when I listen to salsa or merengue , 
Aha . 
I re  it makes me remember parties that I went to with girlfriends where we ended up fighting because they weren't very faithful .   yes . 
with the music ,  hey ,  it's better that there's no radio or putting on songs because you get a bit sad . 
Well ,  music identifies with life ,  you know ? 
This is true .   If you see ,  if you see ,  everyone can identify with this kind of ,  with music .   No one can say that not one song has touched them
in some way , 
Because , 
or another . 
yes ,  because many ,  many people ,  identify with danceable music like merengue or salsa with good times .   Not to me .   I identify them with bad times . 
So ,  everything depends on ,  on how we hear to the music ,  id depends on our personal experiences
Aha ,  this is true . 
yes .   How ,  how we see life depends on our experiences .   But ,  I love music in English . 
Me too , 
I love it ,  well ,  being in the car a Saturday night ,  and I turn up the volume .   But ,  it's more than anything ,  music from the seventies and eighties . 
Ah ,  for example ,  I love disco .   Because ,  disco makes me remember some nice parties I was at in the seventies and eighties . 
yes ,  there are good songs from these times . 
yes ,  when I danced with many . 
This is why ,  you remember
yes .   But not salsa .   The music in Spanish ,  I listen to it very rarely ,  for this reason . 
When I ,  when it's something like Spanish music ,  they're ,  I really like the old songs more . 
Another music that I like ,  is rock in Spanish . 
yes ,  these days I've been listening to one .   And it surprised me because since I've never ,  I pay ,  I pay attention ,  it was good ,  I don't know who it was . 
how old are you ? 
I'm thirty seven . 
how much ? 
Thirty seven . 
Okay ,  we are almost the same age ,  then . 
yes , 
Almost the same .  I'm five years older than you . 
yes ,  yes that is ,  and I'm not from Panama .  In the eighties with the ,  with problems with Noriega ,  I had to leave before that
Do you remember Soda Stereo ? 
What ? 
Soda Stereo
yes . 
Is an Argentinian group that started the Spanish rock phenomenon .  And ,  I remember that they sang in the ,  they gave concerts in the Campin , 
Aha . 
that that's a football stadium in Bogota ,  the main one .  I like that . 
And ,  I have to start ,  listening to a little more songs in Spanish ,  to see what there is out there . 
Well ,  one identifies everything with life .  Well ,  I live in Los Angeles ,  and there have been times when I've gone out with friends to dance salsa , 
Aha . 
and like I'm not drawn to that music anymore ,  so ,  eh ,  I don't know ,  the women realize it and they already don't want to dance with me . 
Then ,  I've gotten to dislike that music .  Then ,  I don't like it anymore .  I don't go to those places anymore ,  and I don't even like to listen to it . 
You are going to have to look in other places that have music ,  more ballads ,  you can find them if you look for them ,  you can find them .  Different types of music . 
Well ,  salsa is the same .  Oh ,  I have ,  I like certain songs but all of them are ,  are oldies .  Some songs I remember make me feel joy and some others make you remember
bad times . 
yes ,  to me ,  salsa and merengue remind me of Panama ,  of before I left
Merengue must be quite popular in Panama ,  isn't it ? 
yes ,  it's quite popular ,  Merengue ,  salsa and nos reaggetton ,  it's now popular over there in Panama ,  so ,  they are really into it
But merengue existed twenty or thirty years ago ? 
Oh yes .  Merengue ,  yes ,  a while now .  I remember that I'd listen to it during the weekends ,  when it was Friday and I was at home ,  the neighbors used to play music and you'd listen to it and there was always a party and
that's so different from here .  The neighbors are always inside their houses ,  you don't really talk to them .  In Panama ,  that was so different . 
And I also loved the Colombian Ballenato .  Yes ,  I like it . 
I don't know what it is . 
It's a type of music ,  it's not as complicated as salsa .  It's a cheerful music and more danceable ,  more danceable . 
Aha . 
and they don't have so many steps nor perfection . 
That's like a
And it's like folkloric music . 
Oh ,  it's like the ,  the typical Panamanian ,  or the one we call
yes ,  I went to a concert once about two or three years ago with one of my girlfriends ,  she has now passed away .  And there was a very famous singer of Colombian Ballenato . 
fuck ,  I can't remember the name ,  he's very famous .  He's the most famous singer in the Ballenato world .  No ,  no ,  oh ,  I can't remember this guys name right now
yes ,  I don't know .  I don't even know what Ballenato is ,  I might have heard it but I don't know .  No . 
It is music from the Colombian coast . 
Aha . 
But ,  it is very nice music .  It is ,  ah ,  Folk ,  easy to dance .  Friendly music  ,  they play issues of life .  While salsa and merengue do not ,  I don´t find it in that
song ,  that music ,  like the vallenato ,  or ballads . 
yes ,  it is that .  There are people who don´t like it at all ,  and others that like it a little .  Of all .  And others that don´t ,  they have their ,  eh ,  everybody has . 
Because ,  when I think in salsa or merengue ,  I think in drinks .  I do not think in something positive .  When I think in vallenato or ballads ,  I am thinking in ,  ah , in life in issues of life ,  in
real things . 
yes ,  so ,  like you say ,  bad experiences with the merengue and salsa , 
yes .  yes
that is what you feel every time you hear it .  That is what puts you in a bad mood .  And ,  you know ,  because you remember the things that
Hello ,  my name is Audria . 
Hello ,  how are you ? 
Fine ,  fine ,  and you ? 
Fine ,  and where are you calling from ? 
From Atlanta . 
Ah ,  I'm in Miami . 
Ah ,  okay Well and let's talk about music because you are in an ideal center for music
yes . 
Do you go a lot to the clubs and dance and that ? 
No ,  we
Oh . 
eh ,  we have a little girl and ,  and I'm pregnant now expecting
Ah . 
the next baby so
Ah ,  okay . 
we don't go out much . 
yes ,  it's well understood ,  I have a four year old daughter and and well ,  I don't go out much either .  Also since I have such a young girl
yes
well the music that I hear is very I already don't listen to the type of music that I used to listen to before having her ,  let's put it that way
Aha .  yes ,  yes ,  when one has kids ,  the music changes . 
yes .   It's true .   But ,  do you listen to Latin music or ,  American music or what ? 
Eh .   I listen to different kinds of music ,  eh ,  depending on how I feel .   Eh ,  now ,  specifically ,  since I have a daughter I'm trying to give her ,  specifically , 
to give her a lot of different kinds of music
yes . 
so she doesn't get used to just one style
yes . 
but ,  eh ,  since I'm married to an American ,  many times we listen to American music ,  eh ,  I don't listen to a lot of Latin music
No . 
no ,  eh ,  I don't know why .   And you ? 
Well I ,  I came to listen to Latin music and ,  you know ,  and I liked it ,  to listen to it live ,  because I
I'm thirty one but only two or three years ago I started listening to Latin music
Hmm . 
and this was because of my brother ,  because my brother bought the CDs and said to me ,  look Audria ,  listen to this ,  I said no ,  but listen to
this and well I started and I started to like it
Hmm . 
but the kid doesn't really like Latin music ,  she likes American music more
yes ,  yes ,  me to ,  but we ,  the music is like a ,  eh ,  something that we listen to a lot
Hmm . 
yes ,  and we always have ,  you know especially ,  okay be  sorry
No ,  no ,  it's ok . 
And we always have ,  you know ,  music in her room ah ,  eh ,  in our house we always have music on ,  it could be eh you know ,  in English ,  no
in English or in Spanish much of the music that I listen to in Spanish is ,  is for kids now
yes
yes ,  you know ,  the ,  the things that ,  that one sang when one was little
yes , 
and and ,  what else ?  I forgot what I was going to say ,  but ,  but we do listen to music a lot
well ,  yes here only when we are in the
here
car and since I live five minutes from ,  from work and five minutes from the school from her daycare
Mm . 
well ,  let's say that it's five minutes in the morning and five minutes in the afternoon that we listen to music and then Saturdays ,  almost always ,  instead of putting on the television
we put music and we start dancing and ,  and playing listening to music
Mm . 
but that of listening to music every day like that for a long time ,  well we don't don't do it because ,  I don't know
Well ,  probably because you are not home . 
no but I say because we are in ,  when we are in the house we normally don't listen to music
Oh , 
only when we are in the car
Mm . 
and since my commute is only five minutes
Mm . 
well the time to listen to music only ends up being just five minutes
Well and
And
also with us ,  we watch a lot of television
yes . 
so ,  you know the time that we are together I always have something ,  you know ,  on ,  but hardly ever the television
yes . 
so she ,  you know ,  she's already in her room playing she comes and tells me that ,  if she's ,  listening to old McDonald's
she comes and tells me cow or ,  you know ,  do ,  whatever you know ,  but we always have something ,  because
Something on . 
yes so that she always listens ,  and even when she sleeps ,  we always have some songs or something on originally it was for ,  for the noise so that she wouldn't hear what was happening in the rest of the house
yes . 
but ,  after that she started to like associate that music with going to sleep . 
Ah ,  okay . 
So we put it really low and ,  you hardly ,  hardly hear it you know ,  is just so that she hears it but not too loud ,  you know . 
yes ,  to give her a sense of ,  of security
Mm
when she lies down . 
yes .  But and ,  and my husband also ,  he ,  he is a ah ,  he ,  he plays a lot eh ,  yes go to the ,  he plays eh ,  the drums
thing like that ,  he is a musician . 
Ah .  He is a musician . 
And he ,  yes ,  he ,  and he eh studied piano you know he has ,  he has eh ,  much experience and much eh we go to school he plays ,  you know ,  instruments
and he plays ,  I think he told me once ,  there are thirty seven kinds
Wow . 
of ,  of instruments and I you know ,  I don´t ,  I don´t know how to read music ,  I know nothing so ,  you know ,  but him I know
he is very important ,  and he likes eh all kinds of music ,  he
and who knows ?  Maybe the genes you know ,  the ,  maybe your daughter is going to be a musician
If God wants , 
if God wants
yes ,  because to me I hear to it ,  I like it ,  but more than that I know nothing
yes . 
So what but you know ,  but to us eh ,  we do not necessarily live in Miami ,  we live in the south eh ,  but it is easier to say Miami and here too ,  what ,  what I like is that there are many
many different kinds of music where we live now ,  there is something like a park crossing the street ,  Saturday and Sundays ,  people rent ,  the
you know ,  an area ,  then
Aha
then eh ,  many times we have Mexican music Italian eh ,  Colombian ,  you know ,  a lot of different eh ,  kinds of music
yes . 
so here you ,  specially ,  hear everything ,  everything ,  even African music ,  sometimes we hear it .  You know I think it is African ,  because it is a language I have never hear in my life
and it has you know ,  a lot of drums and things like that . 
yes ,  it was here ,  here in Atlanta you don't ,  even though there are ,  you know you can go to an area of Atlanta and you are Hispanic ,  and the other ,  a  ,  Lati  place ,  you know
or the other area ,  and it's Jamaican ,  or something like that ,  but to go to a park to discover different types of music depending on the weekend ,  etcetera ,  well ,  this doesn't happen that much here . 
Mm . 
Perhaps once or twice a year we have a Latin Festival or a Jamaican Festival or a Southern Festival but this ,  or I mean ,  every weekend to have something
here in the park ,  I'd like to have something like it ,  but we don't have it here . 
Well the ,  the only problem with this is that the music is very loud ,  very loud ,  that
Ah . 
you know ,  we have ,  we always have air conditioning on ,  because it's always hot ,  so then ,  even with the windows closed ,  you can be ,  let's say ,  in the kitchen
and you hear what is happening in the park . 
Ah ,  wow ,  so then it's very close to you . 
yes ,  yes ,  po  it's across the street . 
Oh .  Oh . 
So then ,  you know ,  people that ,  who don't think that you don't have to have it at top volume ,  you know ,  and you have it here and you go three or four hours with
you know ,  and after a ,  a bit of time it drives you crazy . 
yes ,  you get tired of it after a while . 
yes ,  because I ,  you know ,  I like the music and all ,  but I don't play it loud nor ,  you know ,  I'm not among those people
No ,  and at times you ,  when you are in your home ,  well ,  you want
that
tranquility ,  you know ,  you don't want much disturbance and things
yes
ahh so ,  tall . 
yes but ,  you know ,  and that I don't know if it's like that in Atlanta that when we are in the car we have all the windows closed . 
well ,  all of a sudden two or three cars behind us ,  comes a car and the music begins ,  and our windows is moving
they have the music up so loud
that only happens more in the south of Atlanta because well there's a lot of ah mmmm browns
Mhm
and they like to listen to their music ,  really loud
Mhmm ,  mhm . 
but in another way ,  well no ,  that doesn't happen a lot ,  the people especially I live a little bit to the north of Atlanta
Aha
the people around here are a little bit more tranquil
yes well here no ,  not just the browns here there are Latinos ,  around here is everybody from all over and ,  and ,  and especially ,  I find that the music
that ,  that would be more offensive
It's the loudest . 
Aha
Exactly ,  like reggaeton .  Sorry . 
So that ,  you know  ,  and ,  and and what I told you that ,  that we have the windows close ,  we don't have the windows closed and ,  and you hear everything ,  everything ,  everything ,  and I
I don't know how those people aren't deaf
No ,  but very soon they will be because they have done studies about that ,  eventually yes they affect the ,  the ear
yeah
yes ,  eventually yes ,  they're saying that with all these devices ,  cell phones and ipods that young people are using to listen to music for hours
and hours and hours with that plugged in their ears ,  they say they're seeing levels of he  ,  of hearing loss among ,  you know
among young people ,  younger every year
Wow
So this affects ,  yes that thing  ,  what our grandparents told us ,  ay ,  it's true
Well ,  and then the ,  the other thing is that I don't realize or understand how they can listen to that music
because I ,  outside of the car ,  the only thing I hear is you know and I can hear nothing else ,  so what are they hearing ? 
yes
Just that ? 
I don't know ,  it's cool being like that ,  I don't know
So
But no ,  that's not ,  of enjoying mus  ,  because music is not only the sound ,  but the words ,  and the meaning it gives you
hmm
you know ,  and that ,  listening to it like that ,  I don't think they're enjoying music as they should enjoy it ,  they're not appreciating it as it's meant to
hmm ,  so you know ,  I don't know ,  I
¿Hello ? 
¿Hello ? 
¿Hello ? 
Hi

Um
Then when i put in all these keys and stuff they say uh ,  another subject ,  i mean ,  music .  It was religion once

But i like music ,  i like a lot of different kinds of music ,  i like machine .  .  .  the rock music

Yeah ,  i don't ,  i don't really listen to the radio ,  so i don't know much about today's music ,  and i also watch a lot of MTV or anything like that
So ,  like i said ,  i listen to the music i have
Uh uh . 
and sometimes a friend or someone lends me their compact and then I put that music in in a what is it called an iPod
oh okay
like the compact the iPod because there there's a lot of new music but I don't ,  like I don't find a radio channel that I like too much in New York . 
And what other type of music do you like ? 
I like classical music also . 
Classic ,  no way ? 
Yes in the university I sang in a choir . 
Mm . 
And there like I started to listen to more classical music ,  especially like the sang classical music . 
No I don't like it no ,  it sounds nice but I don't
Choir music
like it . 
Mm . 
It doesn't grab my attention that if I hear it is not that but yes and if there's that classical music I hear it but I don't pay attention to it . 
Mm . 
but I like music ,  do you like country music or not ? 
No . 
You don't like country ?  Me neither but some songs I like because my sisters like those people like Tim McGraw and those people . 
Uh uh . 
Well but she but .  I like more rap and that . 
Mm . 
And the Bachata and that . 
yes ,  I don't like rap too much I mean some groups but not many . 
like ,  you don't know ? 
I don't know ,  sometimes Eminem's songs

Eh .  No I mean in name but
You don't know ? 
I don't know ah yes ,  fifty cents has a song of candy shop or no ?

I don't know ,  no I don't like that song
Look but I like a lot the bachata and those . 
Uh uh
The bachata and the ballads they make I like it when they make a salsa and bachata song . 
Uh uh . 
With one of salsa and bachata like that that they change .  Like they have a song is called . 
Um
Mr .  Quico Rodríguez
Um
He has a Bachata song that was from Ana Barbara ,  i think
Um
That was the song of the bandit ,  because he made her a bandit
Um
And it sounds really nice
And ,  ¿do you like to dance or ? 
¿Huh ? 
¿not much ?  ,  ¿do you like to dance ? 
I don't know how to dance ,  i don't like to dance ,  i have never done that .  I had a dance class and i don't like to do
Yeah ,  i like rap music or certain kinds of Latin music ,  but just to dance ,  i like it
I don't dance happily
And reggae ,  yeah ,  but to dance to
¿But do you dance that ? 
¿which ?  ,  i mean ,  i think that things .  .  .  it's just that when i listen to music at home i kinda like to listen to the lyrics
Uh um
I like to listen to the lyrics and the melody ,  and if the lyrics and the melody aren't interesting ,  i don't like that
And reggaeton ,  reggaeton
I listen to Reagetton all the time because my neighbor plays it all the time ,  in a very high volume . 
And do you dance it ? 
I can listen it across the wall . 
Do you dance ? 
No ,  I don't like it I mean ,  I don't know ,  I don't like it ,  I don't like it ,  I mean ,  I don't like it ,  I wouldn't choose it
as music to play in my apartment . 
But do you dance ,  do you dance ? 
No ,  I mean ,  just a little . 
Mm . 
You see ,  I dance in my own style . 
You have to move a lot . 
How ? 
Move a lot . 
Mm .  In .  Yes ,  the music .  The ,  do you play any instruments or something ? 
No ,  I used to when I was in Junior High School
Uh uh . 
We had to pick one music class so I first took one in elementary school .  I was in the third grade . 
Mm . 
We had to play one and I played the flute . 
Mm . 
But that's all i remember ,  it was a long time ago ,  And later in junior High School ,  we played whatever we wanted
Uh huh
One day i played the drums ,  they taught us to play there ,  the other day guitar ,  yeah ,  but i don't remember much
Uh huh .  And ¿did you like the gym at high school or not ? 
¿what ? 
Did you like to get tired [i believe he meant "Cantar"   sing]
Singing
Uh huh
I didn't sing ,  no ,  lots of rap and all that
Oh ,  um
Because us ,  like you're older than me ,  you're twenty seven
Um
And I'm twenty three ,  and she ,  us ,  i ,  like ,  i don't know about that time ,  there was rap music and all that
Hip Hop ,  that's what i heard there ,  they put those
Um ,  so when i ,  i didn't ,  when i was at school ,  people listened to rap a lot
Yeah ,  well ,  when the others ,  like when the other guys at school
The thing is that
like me and a bunch of boys of twenty ,  boys thirty years old
Uh huh ,  um
And we stayed outside listening to the music ,  they didn't sing ,  but they [ .  .  . ]
Sure . 
It's like this ,  but it's always been different
Sure . 
Rap is something ,  many people don't consider it ,  as they say ,  this isn't music ,  it's no more than ,  no more than words ,  talking about drugs and guns . 
Hmm .   Well it sometimes depends I think . 
But many ,  yeah ,  but many things ,  many ,  a percentage of rap about the life of boys and that
Sure . 
because right now if I have someone to make a rap ,  they will make a rap about me .   That have grown up in a bad area . 
That I've seen people who have killed in trouble ,  and I was outside
Hmm . 
Having to take mine ,  mine . 
Hmm . 
Give me mind ,  in front of the others . 
Hmm . 
And this ,  well ,  to be ,  yes ,  and I want a friend ,  we move to a rap .   That I wrote ,  that I'm going to sing ,  it will be this ,  because it's the only thing I've seen . 
Hmm .   Sure . 
that I've known and after with ,  time will pass expanding ,  sing like but they really have a career in a car and that . 
Hmm . 
How we had to take for having done bad things and this ,  when you're young ,  you don't have to do it . 
Hmm .   Sure .   No I think that you have rap there's a lot of possibility to express ,  as you say ,  one's life ,  like ,  real life . 
Okay . 
Of what people live ,  because I
not anymore . 
eh ,  what I found ,  this year that I had never really heard before was the poetry
Ah what ? 
slam poetry and that like I really liked because it has the rhythm of music but is also ,  has a strong message . 
Okay
And that I don't know if there's a difference between that and the rap
No ,  well that color tree is like is like is something of rap like they have ,  leaves the music on the back part
and you go there in your life but not like the rap that you try to do the rhymes
uh uh
like that and the rap I don't know like that ,  like the gangster of and that ,  like they say of gangster Like that but many many of them really ,  the experiences of life of the people . 
But I mean I found ,  saw a a video ,  there was a group of teachers and one of them did that slam poetry and
and brought a video of the poets doing his his I don't know what they call it ,  and eh ,  and the ,  I found that it was like their life
expressing the things that had happened to them .  I mean discrimination and violence but I don't know ,  the only thing that with the rap sometimes I find it like very
like very obscene . 
yes . 
Is not like so much expressing a message I mean expressing a message of
Okay and
That doesn't bother me because
Talk
there is much life so
yes but they talk very ,  very dirty of women
of course . 
And they put dirty names to white people like
Hmm . 
or this person does not like blacks and this and this . 
Hmm . 
or say this gun is better than this one ,  I have a gun ,  I have a gun here ,  I have a gun there ,  it is more expensive than yours . 
My collar is more expensive than this one
Of course . 
teaching that many children outside want to be like the rappers
Hmm . 
they don´t have ,  don´t have the money so they do things like sell drugs and steal things . 
Hmm . 
but it is easy to them because they make a song and have ten houses and twenty cars and that
Of course .  Of course . 
because you
if you want sometimes so it depends it depends a lot of the group so it is not like all are like that or not in general what what I have seen is that they have like more
i don´t know they sow more hate and problems that
yes well if you put on MTV Cribs those same rappers that rap about hating this ,  hating that you see their houses .  They have a house that
ten rooms they have everything there . 
sure . 
they have
Sure no is more than anything to sell the songs
yes ,  they have cars . 
In other words to sell one sings to the poor
they have
because the poor will buy it . 
they have two hundred fifty thousand dollar cars ,  the lamborghinis .

My daughter is studying Chemical Engineering
Oh ,  that's a hard subject . 
yes ,  quite hard ,  it has been deemed ,  it has been deemed as hard and where are you from ? 
Oh ,  I'm from Cuba . 
Oh ,  okay .  We are from Mexico City . 
Oh ,  that's nice . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  oh well ,  now ,  we have to speak about music .  Cuban people are quite good at it ,  isn't it ? 
Thank you
Cuban music is beautiful ,  well not just in Cuba ,  we Mexicans have also taken it as our own . 
Oh ,  thank you so much . 
Oh in Mexico City ,  Cuban music is quite important ,  there are a lot of dance salons that play Cuban music ,  it really is very ,  very
well ,  it's very important ,  yes . 
It has become quite popular in Mexico . 
yes ,  well it has ,  that's why I'm telling you ,  right here in San Antonio there are three quite nice places ,  one is named
Sugar ,  and they play tropical music but well ,  they also sell Mojito drinks
mm
and also in many other bars in the dance salons in Mexico City . 
mhm
The famous Mojito . 
yes ,  the famous Mojito . 
OH well ,  when I was living there ,  I was studying in the university and I liked to listen to Silvio Rodriguez and the Cuban trove ,  Pablo Milanes . 
hmm
And all these kind of songs and now that I am am a grown up I like to dance well all the retired and all .  And what about you ? 
Eh Well I don´t ,  I don´t follow that thing You know the Cuban music that I .  It is interesting .  But see ,  I wanted to comment you that my son eh ,  I was married to a
Guatemalan man and my children eh spent some years in Guatemala and they come back sometimes and and eh ,  now eh my children each time they go
when they go to Mexico they buy Charro hats to bring back
Well yes
and eh and and one of my children had one but he brought two more . 
aha
So he has three . 
The music ,  Mariachi music
yes
they use that "Charro" hat
yes ,  yes
well it is ,  yes it is very ,  widespread or very popular in Mexico too . 
yes ,  it is ,  yes it is a so beautiful music . 
yes ,  it is true
yes ,  I like it   look today ,  now that we say well ,  I remember one time someone said that he thought it came
form the French occupation when they played at weddings in French they said "Mariachs"
Exactly ,  yes
ah The it truly comes from there ? 
yes ,  I also have this ,  this knowledge ,  so I think that yes ,  it has a lot or relation and has a lot of feeling .   No ? 
hmm
yes I think that it has a lot of feeling .   Eh ,  in Mexico City there's a narrow zone in Zocalo where the Cathedral and the Municipal Pala 
yes ,  yes I know it yes
ce ,  and all this ,  this part of Garibaldi which is where the Mariachis are
ahhh
in a few blocks of the Zocalo ,  so one of them goes in the street offering ,  well ,  for whoever's coming in their cars or walking
eh ,  if they can be hired for a party or something
ahhh
so ,  they cross in the streets ,  one goes in the car and well ,  it's almost dangerous .   Not ,  not to run over them . 
Hmm
And for those who aren't being hired in Garibaldi square
Hmm
they're playing for people who are walking there and they're listening
hmm
so ,  well ,  yes ,  it's very very typical ,  very pachanguero ,  but yeah ,  it's very expensive in any ,  hiring any musical group is very ,  very expensive . 
how much is it ? 
Well and I don't think that it's also here .   Mayra told me the other day ,  Mayra is my daughter who was organizing the Mexican party at University
hmm
that they were going to hire some singer and that they'd canceled because a Mariachi was going to charge them ,  and to me it seemed like a huge amount ,  like six hundred dollars an hour . 
¡On time . 
¡Time . 
Oh
Something like that ,  it was a lot of money .  In Mexico ,  it costs around two hundred dollars an hour
That's a lot considering people earns a lot less
Sure ,  but really ,  they earn ,  they earn a lot less
Yes
And ,  ¿how many years ago did you get here ? 
Oh ,  well ,  it's funny you ask that ,  because i called my son to tell him "look ,  today is the very anniversary of when your grandparents and i came from Cuba"
Oh ,  look at that
Today is the very anniversary
On the fourteen
September fourteen
Of September
Yes ,  One thousand nine hundred and fifty nine
Oh ,  ¡i was born on one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine . 
Oh
Oh ,  well ,  but well ,  so you are .  .  .  you have been here your whole life ,  ¿right ? 
Yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  i just lived for several years in Guatemala ,  as a grown up ,  yes

Well you know that we ,  we haven't been here longer than a year . 
Ahhh . 
yes ,  we're new
Ahhh .  And what made you want to come ? 
Well see look ,  specifically it was our economic situation ,  low wages ,  it was dangerous and getting even worse now ,  it was just the environment with all of the robbery ,  and the kidnapping
this .  .  . and you know so many people living in the same city is incredible
yes ,  exactly
we've got a population of about 26 million people
Ay . 
in the city then
No ,  you can't
you just can't ,  because you go out to the street and have to queue up for everything  ,  absolutely everything .  in the car ,  in the bus ,  in the public transport
everywhere
mhm
And I have relatives here in San Antonio and we came to a family reunion ,  and well ,  they encouraged us ,  and then there were some people who wanted us
to help them taking care of their elder .  And well ,  that's how things turned out
Oh ,  that's good
yes ,  yes ,  yes .  And Philadelphia ,  why did you choose Philadelphia ? 
You know ,  I have always lived in the East Coast ,  and suddenly I came to Philadelphia ,  years ago ,  and I liked it .  .  . 
and finally I moved here
aha
It's a nice city
I want to know it .  My daughter has been for two years already in the university there
ohhh
and I haven't had the chance to visit her yet ,  let's see if I can now ,  now we are here .  It is much cheaper to buy a
a flight ticket and so
Sure ,  yes ,  yes
it will take some time ,  and specially you have to save before you can spend
That's it ,  right
yes . 
yes . 
And how many kids do you have ? 
I have three Three yes ,  a girl who already finished the University .  And two boys who are in the University . 
aha
Eh ,  this one who is in the University of Pennsylvania is in his last year .  And I have one in Cornell who is in his third year .

yes it is ,  and that they are women . 
yes ,  that has a very great merit ,  yes . 
Exactly ,  Exactly .  And she's already ,  And she's already married ? 
She's not married and she just broke up with her boyfriend . 
Oh
yes ,  She's going to be twenty four years old this month
aha

Mine is twenty one years old . 
mm
And she's in the ,  eh starting well the third year of her career . 
aha ,  aha
Starting the third year of the career .  And she wants to get into some subjects in also .  To have ,  you know
mm
that can have the Major and who knows ,  I mean to have two career let's see if she can .  Because really is always hard
Very hard . 
coming from such a different culture ,  right ? 
No ,  and you know what ,  I know it because of my son that two of the hardest faculties in the Univer  ,  in that University are ,  The engineering
and Journal he has a Chinese friend who is doing double concentration in Engineering and in Finance in Journal And and he says that is crazy
that ,  that the work he has is tremendous
Jeez . 
yes . 
yes ,  that's what my daughter is thinking .  but I think that I'm also going to tell her to not even think about it
Is ,  is hard ,  is .  Of course that that when he finishes that later he'll be making a lot . 
Sure .    But
But but but it's hard ,  hard ,  hard . 
hmm
And they have to be there all summer ,  every summer .   It's an enormous compromise . 
It is
And very difficult . 
Sure ,  sure because University is pretty demanding like ,  yikes .   It complicates things right ?   Besides ,  well . 
You need to be a really strong kid ,  no ? 
Bessy [Betsy] ,  Hello
Hello ,  yes ,  this is Tammy
Tammy ,  hi ,  ¿how are you ?

From El Salvador
Oh ,  I'm from Panama
Oh
Yeah ,  i like it too ,  i spoke to a boy yesterday that every time i told him something about salsa ,  he said i was making him depressed
¿Why ? 
Because he says that every time he hears salsa or merengue
Right
he recalled the days when women did evil things to him
That's funny
I day ,  well ,  I'm not gonna tell him anything ,  because i like salsa and merengue and the man "no ,  uh .  .  . "
he doesn't like it ,  he gets depressed a lot .

um uh Yes ,  is true . 
I think that ,  is the same when I go walking ,  in exercises ,  if I don't have anything to listen to ,  I go really slow ,  if I have music ,  there you can't catch me . 
aha
Because I walk faster . 
That's true ,  because the music cheers you up more .

My husband is American so that when we got married in Panama ,  but when I came here I didn't have many people who

No one spoke Spanish

So I forgot Spanish a little bit . 
aha
Some things ,  but my kids couldn't catch on to Spanish
oh
the smallest one ,  my bigger one was three when we came here ,  he knew a little Spanish ,  but when he got together with the cousins . 
aha
they do  they don't speak Spanish . 
Only English . 
Only English ,  not my small one ,  Eh ,  who's fifteen ,  is taking Spanish classes
uh huh
now he understands because this summer I sent him to spend the summer with my sister
aha
In Maine and her husband is Mexican . 
aha
And they have a Mexican restaurant ,  he was working there and nobody speaks English there . 
and he's hu what
Oh my God ,  I'm surprised that this kid when he first got here .  And the other day he was translating ,  I told him ,  where did all of that come from ?  ,  and he said ,  well ,  just by listening to it ,  aunty . 
aha ,  oh that's good
So ,  he is studying Spanish in school but
that's good
The music is like ,  he also listens to music ,  he just started to I know that's what's he's doing ,  it's a bit fast but I understand
Oh ,  like reggae music ,  rap music
aha
Oh ,  I don't understand it ,  I don't understand what they say
Oh no
It's pretty weird ,  that music . 
They ,  yes ,  they laugh ,  they ,  kids ,  they don't understand Spanish when spoken that fast and he told me what they were saying and I told him ,  that's now what he said . 
yes and then I told him ,  you know what ,  they speak so fast that he can't understand them . 
It's true ,  they say more things ,  well yes .  Music in Spanish that I do like are the songs of Luis Miguel . 
Oh ,  I love Luis Miguel
It makes me remember the past .

Nice ,  oh ,  mi husband says "what ,  ¿are you romantic today ? " ,  "no ,  i found it" ,  and i say ,  i start to sing "my house" and he starts laughing
right
i tell him "well ,  yeah ,  you make me happy like that" ,  i tell him "hey ,  ¿don't people tell you i look younger than i am ?  ,  it's because of the music boy" ,  and he starts laughing
Right ,  and ¿does he understands Spanish or ? 
Oh ,  he understands a little
Oh ,  right
Uh ,  when we were in Panama i spoke plenty of Spanish
Right
Around him
Yes
So ,  my mom doesn't speak a lot of spanish ,  my family ,  so
Uh huh
But he understands you if you speak slowly ,  i mean ,  regularly ,  well ,  he gets some things .  But he reads it well
Right
I was amazed the other day ,  he was reading some paper the Spanish teacher sent the other day ,  she sent it home and it didn't have any translation
Uh huh
Just in spanish .  My husband said "what if i don't know spanish ,  how can i know what it says there ? " ,  and he started reading and he translated for me and i told him "yeah ,  you got it" ,  he says "ok"
That's good
But later on he told me "hey ,  why didn't that teacher put the translation on the back ,  there are parents who don't know2 ,  i tell him "well"
Yeah ,  It's true
you're gonna have to send her an e mail and tell her ,  because it's true
Yeah
Yes ,  but yeah ,  the other day i was watching on tv ,  that there was ,  on that channel ,  Univision
uh huh
There was a show that had a little bit of Panamanian music

um uh
We go there almost always . 
Ah how nice
To have a little fun there where the beach is ,  or if not we go to Langley
aha okay
Because my son likes to go shopping there ,  Or Zury he likes to go to Zury Mall . 
Aha
And my husband went to Canada to do the eye surgery like four years ago . 
Oh aha
To not use the glasses . 
Oh what a lady's man ,  how much did that cost him ?  without
One thousand dollars
for two ,  for both eyes
aha
what ,  wel  ,  Canadian
yes ,  he had bad vision
um uh
He had really thick glasses ,  and now he uses no glasses at all
Oh how good ,  because I use glasses ,  no ,  not so thick ,  but I'm bored of them because I have to clean them all the time ,  that's what I hate
yes ,  me too ,  I told him that this year ,  that next year I don't want no gifts in the anniversary ,  Christmas ,  mother's day ,  whatever ,  I just want my eyes ,  and he laughs at me
I see ,  and what did they tell you ,  OK
He says ,  OK then
eh ,  that's a good idea ,  I'll tell my husband
Aha
I don't want no Christmas gift ,  I want my eyes
Right ,  because I told him ,  what you spend in all that is the cost of the ,  of my operation ,  so just put it all together
Yes ,  that's right
And that will be a gift for all the years to come .  I'll appreciate ,  and he laughs and says OK
Aha ,  yes .  And you forget about glasses and contact lenses ,  all that I hate
Oh ,  yes ,  yes ,  that's what I was thinking ,  I was saying the other day I must go to the doctor to fix my eyes ,  and get contacts before the new year
Un hu
to get them from the insurance ,  it's a mess
That's right .  And what city did you go to ?  your husband ,  for the operation ?  In Zury ,  that's where I live ,  also

o ,  really
Like two blocks from Zury mall ,  close to ,  that's Zury ,  the mall
uh
then there's the theater ,  behind the theater

It was there ,  but I think they already closed it down
Oh ,  that's a shame
I think ,  I'm not sure ,  but you should check it out because yes ,  it came out well
that's nice
Call Lexington
uhm ,  uh ,  my husband is scared because he says I can end up blind ,  but I tell him ,  I have to tyr
after you find
I already have the cane
After you find a person who's had  who's had it done ,  because that people has done it a lot
oh ,  uhm hu
and then you go to a clinic here ,  and they give you the ride from here .  From where I am to there
And ,  yeah
To get your surgery done ,  and then they brought you back ,  you got in your car ,  well someone drove you

Mhm . 
I'm from Puerto Rico so I really like Salsa ,  I really like music and I love to dance . 
mhm . 
I believe that
yes ,  I like Salsa music too . 
music really relaxes me ,  especially when I'm really tense . 
Hmm . 
So ,  I really like to listen to music when I'm cleaning the house .   I like any kind of music .   I like classical music ,  romantic music ,  I love music from my country
because they bring me memories of people who at times aren't by my side ,  especially around the Christmas holidays ,  eh , 
Hmm . 
when you miss your whole family .   So ,  I like it a lot . 
yes ,  I ,  I also like music .   I wouldn't say that I'm a fanatic .   But ,  yes ,  I like music a lot ,  I really like the
salsa ,  ah ,  romantic music .   Em ,  also the music that we play in my ,  in my temple ,  in my church . 
Oh ,  you're from the church ,  now yes ,  now I remember ,  aha .

Ah ,  oh ,  now I remember ,  yes , 
What happened ? 
about you .

No ,  no ,  no .   In my ,  I ,  I'm not Christian ,  I belong to a church . 
Oh ,  oh ,  right .   yes ,  yeah .   Aha . 
yes ,  we have music ,  music ,  no ,  that we call ,  it's music in the Sanskrit language . 
Aha .   Ah ,  okay . 
No ,  and it's ,  it's really pretty ,  because people like it a lot ,  it's really lively . 
yes ,  I like it .  I ,  I tell you ,  I told you that I would get with them to dance when they played in the street ,  yes ,  aha . 
Ah ,  sure ,  sure ,  yes ,  yes . 
Aha . 
Look ,  I think that then ,  there must not be that many we are in the ,  in the same group ,  yes ,  going around . 
yes ,  I like it .  Aha ,  aha . 
Because ,  yesterday I spoke with another lady also ,   who is from ,  that she is ,  eh ,  she told me she worked as a clown .  And ,  is the second time that I speak with her also . 
Oh ,  yes . 
Aha .  yes ,  the music really ,  is ,  no ,  is a part of people's culture
Each country has ,  I think that the music connects the countries . 
No .  MM . 
Because almost always , 
yes . 
if you go to another country ,  you ,  you hear music from that ,  from ,  from your country , 
Mm . 
or listen to music that you like ,  from other countries also .  So ,  anywhere you go ,  the music ,  at least ,  well , 
Mm . 
one always remembers ,  whether is Italian ,  or in French ,  that the music sounds more or less ,  has the same tune ,  I mean ,  the tune doesn't change . 
Sure .  Mm . 
Well ,  you already play it ,  you can identify it for the ,  for the tune .  But ,  for me ,  the music is important because I like it a lot ,  and I find that it helps me a lot to get rid of stress , 
yes ,  the music no
and to relax
music helps to relax ,  it has a message .  No and ,  different types of messages ,  there's spiritual music or even classical music ,  isn't it ? 
Aha .  Aha ,  yes and now they even have music to relax ,  with rain noise and
Aha .  Oh yes yes ,  my husband is the one
birds ,  from the birds . 
Aha ,  he  listens to those
Aha
to relax after work
yes ,  that's a good thing ,  you get home from work all stressed out and
aha . 
you shouldn't listen to that noisy music like Rock and Roll ,  I don't really like it . 
Or rap . 
I listen to that ,  for a while ,  because of my children but ,  no ,  it's not something that I really like
Aha . 
I'm not that interested in it .  I like romantic music ,  classical music
Mhm . 
Merengue ,  Salsa ,  Bachata ,  I like those types .  I like
Sure ,  yes .  I can imagine
I do like to dance a lot . 
Mhm . 
Even to
yes ,  I also like to dance , 
even to clean the house ,  I put music on ,  and ,  aha . 
You start dancing . 
One advances more ,  one cleans like with more ,  more energy ,  more ,  more rhythm . 
Mm . 
You go to the rhythm of the music there .  Step by step ,  cleaning here ,  cleaning there ,  and one finishes faster . 
Ah ,  yes .  One like that ,  while you're at it you do the chores . 
And ,  for the kids ,  the ,  when the kids are little ,  if you play them music ,  the music also ,  calms them a little ,  especially when they are a little sick . 
Aha ,  yes . 
If one plays music for them ,  they relax a little more ,  they get calm ,  right
And they also learn many things with the music .  Now they have those ,  those videos , 
Aha ,  Aha , 
and those eh  DVD's ,  that teach the kids different things in ,  and they play music .  And then ,  there is like it engraves more . 
yes ,  it teaches them the letters ,  and it teaches them many things ,  is true .  With music ,  one learns
Aha . 
And ,  one learns also from other customs .  Because ,  if you start to listen to Chinese music ,  Arab music , 
Mm . 
despite being different ,  they have ,  are nice musics that have some sounds ,  well ,  that one ,  doesn't hear in one's culture ,  you don't hear them that much . 
Mm . 
I also like Peruvian music a lot
¿Oh yes ? 
Yes ,  the music
I'm Peruvian
Oh ,  yes ,  Peruvian music ,  i find it's beautiful ,  it has like
¿Do you like folkloric Peruvians music ? 
The ,  yes
Oh ,  OK
I love it ,  i love it ,  when they do the Hispanic Parade here in New York
Right
The group i find makes the best presentation is the Peruvian one
Uh huh
They have ,  they have some ,  the ,  the costume designs
Right
And the music ,  they're very nice .  They're like very autonomous from their country ,  they're very different .  So ,  i like it a lot .  I love to hear the ,  Peruvians music because of the ,  like the one with flute ,  ¿is that what they use ? 
yes ,  the flute and ,  the quena ,  the quena .  We call it Quena ,  it's a sort of flute
Right
But that one is called quena
It's like bamboo or something
Yes ,  yes ,  it's quena
uh huh ,  uh huh . 
Who is ,  and the ,  the other that ,  that played ,  I don't remember the name ,  it was one that had ,  like several straws together
uh huh ,  uh huh ,  with several straws ,  uh huh ,  that one . 
yes
yes ,  it was like three or four ,  small runs . 
uh huh . 
It seemed like it was a mouth symphony
uh huh ,  yes ,  yes . 
But ,  I don't know what they called it either .  But I really liked it ,  the sound was very beautiful . 
Ah ,  I ,  I can imagine .  I've already ,  I've already forgotten the ,  mm ,  The name of this instrument ,  it's from my country ,  I've already ,  I forgot . 
Well ,  it's been many years , 
I have ,  I've seen it in ,  eh ,  in ,  when you go to Atlantic City . 
Mm
They put on ,  almost always there is a table of Peruvian CDs ,  and ,  and the ,  the
Mm . 
The clothing ,  and ,  and they sell a lot of music of ,  of ,  Peruvian music .  So then ,  then have the CDs ,  then ,  and they sell those little flutes .  Am ,  I don't know what they are called ,  I call them flutes ,  but , 
but I know that they have like three or four ,  and they are made of bamboo , 
yes
tied together ,  yes
yes ,  that's it ,  those ,  And so then ,  there is another that is larger ,  like a flute ,  really ,  that is called Quena ,  that is ,  I remember more
Aha ,  aha ,  the aha ,  yes .  And there is also one that is like
MHm
like if it was broad
MHm
You put the fingers in front and play it ,  they always play it to sell it .  And the drums you make ,  like this ,  you hit the side ,  I don't know ,  like
Aha
like if you hit a drum ,  I don't know how they call it ,  but it sounds fine when they play the music .  I really like it
yes ,  that kind ,  that kind of music .  It is not folkloric ,  it is a mixture of music
Indian music ,  ha ,  OK
from the Incas ,  yes ,  the Incas .  And it is a mixture ,  right' ,  of Inca music with Spanish music
Oh ,  OK
So ,  there ,  eh ,  the Peruvians made their music
ye ,  to me it sounds really nice
No ,  mm
It is the Peruvians and who else play it ?  There is another another nationality that sound very alike
Oh ,  Bolivia
The ,  the ,  oh ,  aha ,  aha ,  Bolivia ,  and the Arg  the Argentinean too ,  right ? 
yes ,  the Argentinean .  Well ,  no ,  not so alike .  The Argentinean are a little different because there was a big Italian influence in Argentina
Well ,  the Argentinean uses more the ,  how you call it ?  the ,  that rope that they ,  somehow throw .  To the rhythm of the cable I don't know how they call it
Oh , I don't know ,  idon't know much of Argentina
Aha ,  they they ,  I believe that they do it more like ,  like a ho ,  what they call a Joropo . 
Mhm . 
They jump and dance with a rope .  They have a rope and they throw it like if they were trying to catch a horse . 
Oh yes ,  yes ,  like the gaucho ,  that's the name . 
Oh yeah ,  that's it ,  exactly ,  the Gaucho ,  well they use the rope dance
Aha
But they use ,  some instruments that are similar to the ,  to the ones of the Peruvians . 
yes ,  it all sounds very familiar ,  it's the Hispanic culture ,  isn't it ?  In South America ,  so ,  this ,  Bolivia and Peru are kind of more ,  oh ,  similar . 
yes ,  aha ,  aha . 
yes because
yes ,  their costumes are also similar ,  when they have their parades ,  they are alike ,  they have colors ,  I believe ,  but they have the same
mhm ,  yes . 
the same round little hats . 
Aha . 
Really pretty .  And they girls wear this small skirts ,  with pretty patterns ,  really bright green color . 
yes . 
And I really like their music ,  all the time . 
Lots of colors . 
I always see them ,  I love to dance their music and to listen to the flutes ,  I really like the piano and the harp . 
I'd love to listen to it ,  people playing the harp .  I never learned to play it but I like it ,  I'm drawn to it ,  it's like
yes ,  oh ,  I
I don't know ,  it has ,  such a beautiful sound . 
Do you know how to play any instruments ? 
No ,  I don't ,  my daughter knows how to play the piano but I don't . 
Aha . 
I like ,  I like the guitar but I know what it is to jump and dance ,  that's all . 
 .  Mhm . 
I don't know anything about playing instruments ,  maracas . 
Aha . 
In Puerto Rico they play a lot with the maracas during Christmas parties and in the Guaracho ,  they call it like that . 
Aha . 
I don't know how you call it ,  if you call it guaracho or I think that some people call it carrancho , 
Mhm . 
some others call it ,  I don't know how they call it in their own countries ,  if they have it .  But ,  the music is quite nice ,  really beautiful . 
yes ,  music is interesting ,  isn't it ?  It sends cultural messages for all the people ,  you can show off your culture ,  the culture of every place ,  every country . 
No ,  and , 
At church ,  they've been using it a lot to ,  to bring more people in because ,  right now
Mhm . 
if you attend Hispanic mass ,  at least the ones that we have here in ,  the choir sings pretty well
Mhm . 
They play the guitar ,  they have a conga ,  they play the battery ,  girls sing in the choir ,  so ,  they give a nice performance
yes ,  to bring in more people ,  right ? 
Exactly ,  aha ,  yes ,  so that they feel a bit more interested in it ,

yes ,  yes
Uh huh
It's a matter of practicing and letting yourself get carried away by music and that's it
Right ,  but it's ,  I'd like to do that ,  but i can't ,  my husband can't either
Yes ,  and ,  i don't know ,  in ,  there weren't many places to go dancing salsa in
no
Nebraska ,  it would be difficult too
Um ,  there's a place in Lincoln ,  uh ,  but it's Merengue there
Uh huh
And i don't like that
Yeah ,  no ,  Merengue is like boring ,  because in the salsa ,  i don't know ,  like the moves are more complicated and the spinning and all that ,  but in Merengue like you do the same all the time
Right ,  oh ,  right
Yes ,  it's like the ,  Bachata
I don't know what that is
¿You don't know what bachata is ? 
Ah ,  ah
You are from the Dominican Republic ,  right ? 
Oh
The merengue is also from the Dominican Republic
Oh
But the bachata is like ,  is more or less like the merengue ,  but it has a little more complexity ,  but
Oh ,  aha
yes ,  but no ,  no I don't like dancing it either
Oh ,  no ,  I don't feel like either
Uhum
But yes ,  here now there are already some places ,  even in twenty four street
Aha
it is just Mexican stores
Oh ,  yes
or  restaurants
Hum
Um ,  there quite a lot of Hispanic in Omaha right now
Oh ,  that's cool ,  yes ,  when I was there ,  ah ,  it must have been one thousand nine hundred ninety nine and two thousand
Aha
I was there in summer
Oh ,  aha . 
and the only Latins there were was a group of students that were learning ,  eh English . 
Aha that's little
yes ,  they were there taking English classes ,  and then we were all staying in the same apartments for students
Oh ,  aha
then ,  they had been there a long time ,  because the ,  the ,  the program to learn English took six or eight months
Oh . 
but I was going to be there only like for ten weeks . 
Oh ,  aha . 
then ,  eh ,  I met them ,  and they did throw parties
Aha . 
because some of them were staying in ,  in houses of people that were housing them
Aha
and then they would do parties there in those houses and and ,  eh ,  and then we would go there to dance ,  but
Oh
we didn't know of any place where we could go to dance oh
Um . 
there was only one Mexican restaurant that would play Latin music there ,  but
Oh ,  aha ,  it doesn't
nothing else
Jolanda went like a month
Aha
there also and I ,  I also like her music
yes ,  aha . 
and but I can't go
Um . 
but now also many ,  many singers go to do concerts there in Omaha also . 
Um . 
And ,  you know ,  we can go and sometimes we can't ,  because since ,  everything is far and then they start drinking and all that well
Uh um . 
one cannot drive like that
yes ,  yes .  But I think that for us the Latins who live in the United States
Aha . 
perhaps the Latin music is more important than for the people that are
Ah ,  aha
in the Latin American countries ,  perhaps they don't ,  don't value the music so much ,  one doesn't value the music as much
Aha ,  You know ,  ah . 
when you are in your country until you are out of your country . 
Oh ,  I can imagine ,  But you know when ,  I went to Mexico
Uh um
four years ago I went to a discot  in ,  I don't know if you know Mexico ,  but
Uh um . 
eh it's called Culiacan
Uh um . 
yes no ,  eh ,  if you go to Mexico and know the disco was pure music in English
yes , 
Quite a few places that we went to
Uh um . 
had music in English ,  it wasn't
Uh um . 
music in Spanish
Uh um
and I found it strange . 
yes ,  ah ,  yes in Puerto Rico the people that go to visit Puerto Rico ,  the ,  the Americans that like to dance salsa
Aha . 
say recommend me a place where I can go to dance salsa ,  and I say there's none . 
Oh ,  really ? 
There isn't ,  there's no club that ,  that plays salsa .  They all play music in English or ,  or the reggaeton that new one there is . 
Um Aha . 
But if you want to go dance salsa you have to find a festival . 
Ah . 
The festivals that are in the streets that are open ,  are outside . 
Okay
Those festivals ,  there you find salsa and merengue ,  .  But not in a club ,  these are very few ,  perhaps one or two and ,  and they are not too big or too good . 
Um .  How strange right ? 
Um ,  yes ,  yes
yes ,  ah ,  I also found it strange when we went .  Since I like to dance the mu 
¿Hello ? 
¿Hello ? 
Yes ,  ¿who am i talking to ? 
This is Mercedes
Oh ,  ¿where are you at ,  Mercedes ? 
Um ,  I'm talking from Pennsylvania ,  ¿and you ? 
Oh ,  I'm outside of Philadelphia
Oh ,  OK
¿Where in Pennsylvania are you ? 
In ,  it's west of Philadelphia city
Um ,  i can't get to know where you are
Yes ,  near .  .  . 
Um ,  i ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yeah ,  i know where it is ,  yes ,  Uh huh
And you ? 
Yes ,  i ,  I'm near Philadelphia too ,  but up north
Oh ,  OK
Yes ,  uh ,  my name is Sylvia
Oh ,  nice to meet you ,  Silvia
Nice to meet you ,  ¿what country are you from ? 
I'm from Honduras
oh ,  that's interesting .  Oh ,  this is the first time that I speak with someone from Honduras in this research . 
Oh ,  and where are you from ? 
I'm from Cuba . 
And how many calls have you done so far ? 
This might be the sixth one . 
Mm .  Oh okay ,  I've just begun .  This is my first call
Oh ,  that's nice . 
Mm . 
yes ,  look ,  I got confused because they first said that the subject was marriage and then they said that we should talk about the importance of music ,  or what type of music
do you like so ,  I'm confused about which is today's subject . 
Well I want ,  I believe that we should talk about music because they gave many different examples of what we could talk about . 
Oh ,  that's fine .  Hmm .  Look ,  I like music from Honduras ,  that's what I know about . 
Oh ,  Mh .  Well ,  I ,  we have the music type ,  we have one that you could say ,  it's a tenth ,  oh ,  many people listen to it ,  oh
They call it the point rhythm . 
Oh . 
It's a Caribbean rhythm . 
Oh . 
Oh ,  there are lots of African Caribbeans
Mm . 
in the north coast of our country
Um
So they play a lot ,  this kind of music that's very .  .  .  um ,  dance ,  to dance
Oh
Yes ,  um ,  and it's the kind of music that's maybe a little bit more commercialized
Um
That's the music that's originally from Honduras
Um
Uh ,  after that ,  the other kind of music of which there have been groups that play in Honduras is Merengue
Oh
Yes ,  and
¿And where does Merengue come from ,  which part of the Caribbean did it start on ? 
¿The what ? 
Merengue ,  i know it's Caribbean ,  but ¿where is it from ?  ,  more specifically
no ,  no ,  i really don't know ,  I'd think that maybe .  .  .  um .  .  .  no ,  because i believe Salsa is more Puerto Rican
Uh huh ,  yes ,  yes
Merengue ,  maybe like Dominican ,  maybe ,  Dominican Republic
Maybe ,  because i have a Dominican friend that talks a lot about merengue
Um
So ,  maybe ,  and ,  but I'm interested to say that salsa is more recent ,  more or less ,  but singers that
but they talk about it like Celia Cruz's salsa music ,  and all that
Mm . 
that eh that's a very recent denomination . 
Uh uh . 
She ,  before no ,  they didn't say she was a salsa singer . 
In let's say ,  in Cuba what would she be considered ? 
I don't ,  look since I've been out so long and I'm not in that environment
Mm .  Mm . 
eh but but what I remember is that they didn't identify her with anything specific ,  but rather popular music singers
Okay
Without being more ,  without trying to be more specific
Mm . 
Mm .  Look ,  and how long have you already been here in the United States ? 
Mm .  I came in ninety five when I finished my university education . 
Ah . 
from ninety five to ninety seven .  Then I returned to Honduras for two years and later I returned in ninety nine and I've been here ever since . 
Ah ,  are you already staying to live here or are you returning or
yes ,  yes .  Because I got married to an American and I've already stayed here . 
Ah ,  well yes no wonder yes . 
And how long have you been here ? 
A ,  no I I came here when I was nine . 
Oh
Yes ,  and I've been here ever since
Uh huh ,  and ,  ¿what kind of music do you like here ?  ,  i think the one here ,  well
From
Or ,  in spanish ,  ¿do you like music in English better or in spanish ?  ,  ¿do you listen to a lot of music in spanish ? 
Uh ,  no ,  no ,  i like it but i really don't listen to it ,  uh ,  I'm an opera lover
Oh
yes ,  yes ,  but that's not interesting to many people
¿And do you listen to it on CD or do you go to the opera to listen to it ? 
Now ,  now i haven't gone to the opera ,  but yeah ,  on CD ,  yes
Uh huh
Yes ,  it's so easy nowadays ,  and ,  and they also sell videos
Uh huh ,  uh ,  i listen ,  yeah ,  i don't have money to watch ,  but i do have a CD that's an Italian that has ,  uh ,  Tenor ,  he has a tenor like voice
it's called
Uh ,  of course
and i have some of that because i love it .  It's a very nice voice
Um ,  it has a very nice voice ,  yes
Maybe like more ,  uh ,  commercial ,  right ? 
Uh huh
The other one also seems like he's had a little opera is that Josh Groban ,  ¿have you heard him ? 
No ,  no ,  no
He's more ,  he's more .  .  .  he's like twenty one or two years ,  more or less
Oh ,  young
Yes ,  and they say it's also like that .  He started as an Opera singer and gotten much more commercial
Um
Um ,  but i have only gone once to the Opera
And ¿did you like it ? 
Quite ,  yes ,  uh ,  ¿which was it the one i went to see ?  ,  oh ,  i don't remember .  Of course it's in Italy ,  i was in Italy ,  but it's about two
couples ,  i really don't remember
Um
Oh ,  yes
Because they have been putting [sub] titles on Operas since years ago
Oh
Uh ,  uh ,  if you go to the theater in the United States ,  they have like a screen where
Oh
they put the titles of the translation of everything they're saying
Um
Everything they're singing ,  yes
Um
And that has helped to increase opera's popularity a lot
Ah . 
Because eh ,  you enjoy more the things if you know what is happening . 
Hmm .  That year the ninety seven I think that it was before the first time I went to Honduras . 
Hmm . 
And they did not have that . 
Ah . 
And went to New York ,  and it was in New York city .  They do not have that . 
Ah ,  but . 
but it was also many years ago . 
yes ,  no that that no they have virtually from all places because they have seen that that rise a lot eh ,  the
enjoyment of the people of Opera .  And also the videos they sell always have subtitles .  and those things have rise the number of people interested in the Opera . 
Hmm .  But lets say that we who speak Spanish . 
Yeah .  yes .  yes .  yes .  yes .  You get more than Americans .  Definitively yes . And And I see that there are so many words .  that for us
Latin is a simple language there are words in English that you understand better easier than Americans .  because is those are words a little bit
elegant then are Latin but they do not have the base of Latin .  I have some eh one would be Carmen .  It is a French Opera .  Eh ,  I like Mozart very much . 
Mozart´s Operas .  Eh ,  I like a lot Verdi .  See I have been apart of that a little and the singers are getting older . 
And the singer .  Eh .  Eh as their instrument is their bodies .  Then according the body is their instrument
eh ,  it betrays them .  eh ,  they do not sing so well .  Because it is a physically deteriorated instrument .  And then Pavarotti Domingo already
they are not as they were before .  Exactly . Exactly the singer is very vulnerable .  Because the violinist can play when he is seventy ,  seventy five years old . 
But the singer after forty five starts to lose his voice .  And there are things he could not do anymore . 
And the complete quality of the voice is affected .   And sometimes you see singers who are older who come back to singing .   And it's a shame for them . 
yes because you say ,  how nice they sang before .   Why don't we leave them with this memory instead of coming now and ,  and making sounds that
aren't dignified to their memory .   Ah ,  yes yes yes .   It's a real pity .   yes .  yes .   Hmm ,  yes ,  it's true because ,  I think that this is an area with few Latinos . 
I know that in the mere city there are many who don't ,  I'm not very sure where they are ,  and I think that there's an area there in the center but
it's not ,  it's not a very good are .   Like in North Philly .   AH ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes .   In New Jersey ,  yes . 
And it's in New Jersey there's a very big Latino population ,  yes ,  New Jersey ,  New York ,  now ,  but Honduras
hello ,  hello hi ,  very good ,  very good ,  ah my name is Laya
Hello very good and you ?  how nice Laya I'm Michael
Michael very good a pleasure
how are you ? 
very good ,  very good is my first call that I make and I don't know too well how it works
is the first
yes yes yes
yes is my first also
ah very good ,  very good
I can't hear the issue the call about what we have to talk about
about ,  about music it said about what type of music we like
oh of music ah well
yes the music plays an important role in our lives ,  is like that
ah well and what do you think ? 
I like music a lot ,  I listen to a lot of music every day
yes
and I like I don't know several types from classical music to
ah yes
yes classical music especially to relax ,  to study
yes yes
and then well I like more modern music
yes
American or Brazilian music also I like a lot
yes I ,  I'm Brazilian
yes ,  ah well
yes I like the music from there a lot
ah well I like a lot well I don't know
okay
Caitana Veloso ,  Vinisios like that
of coming a
aha ,  yes yes yes
eh you already went to Brazil or not ? 
what ? 
you went to Brazil already ? 
no I've never been in Brazil
never
eh well in Latin American I've only been in Costa Rica
ah yes
but but in Brazil ,  no ,  but I have a Brazilian friend
yes
and he well always gives me music and and I like Brazilian music a lot
how nice and no I also like music a lot eh I like American music a lot like blues
aha ,  aha
eh and Brazilian also and Colombian
mm how is Colombian music
well the the is a type of music is like a
like salsa or
I don't remember what is called my dad likes that type of music a lot and always since little I would hear eh my dad listening to that type of music
aha ,  aha
I like to listen a lot to like country Colombian music
okay okay
yes
what part of Brazil are you from ? 
Brasilia ,  the capital
ah okay from the capital
yes but I lived in Rio
aha
a few years and ,  where are you calling from ? 
I'm from Barcelona from Spain
from Spain mm
And ,  ¿do you play any instruments ? 
Yeah ,  guitar
Right ,  my Brazilian friend does too ,  he plays the guitar too
Yeah ,  a little ,  i want to learn piano but it's very hard ,  ¿do you play something ? 
I ,  i studied piano for many years
Oh yes
Um ,  yeah ,  almost too many
Yes , 
but now ,  well ,  yeah ,  for almost ,  yeah ,  for almost ten years and i left it now ,  and i learned a little about guitar ,  well ,  just to play popular songs
Yes ,  yes
but
yeah ,  oh ,  that's good
and do you go here to ,  do you go to concerts often or
¿What ? 
uh ,  do you go to music concerts regularly ? 
Yes ,  I'm going to a concert tomorrow
right
from a band that's called [ .  .  . ] do you know it ? 
and ,  no ,  i really don't
it's a hip hop group ,  rap
ah . 
American but there are some Hispanic types in the group as well
uh huh ,  uh huh . 
I'm going there tomorrow . 
For me ,  hip hop and rap is perhaps the type of music I like the least
you don't like it ,  then ? 
no ,  not much
to me ,  I ,  I didn't like it until ,  until around five years ago when I came to the United States . 
Hmm ,  mm . 
And when I listened to it more I liked it
yes ,  I suppose that when you understand it more you appreciate it
that's true
But to me ,  well ,  to me ,  it seems to be very repetitive music also ,  and if you don't really understand the words ,  you know ?  I suppose that you also lose a lot
if ,  if because everything ,  if I believe all of the art in this type of music is in the lyrics
of course ,  of course ,  then
so what they say ,  if ,  if it's difficult to understand ,  it's difficult to appreciate the music
of course ,  of course ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
yeah ,  well ,  that more
and of Spanish music you know something
eh ,  no ,  not much ,  a little flamenco guitar
that is good from the south more than anything
yes yes so
yes ,  but now there are groups also modern groups that make a fission of flamenco with
yes
even with hip hop and with well
yes new Spanish tell me some to see if I look for them
for example there well one that is a fashion now it is eyes of the witch
okay
and these are flamencos but very
yes
modern and they mix well that with hip hop with rumbas ,  with all and that people well in Spain have had a big success
yes
and now I saw they even have a tour in the United States so they are going out
ah yes ah how good yes I eh
hmm and I tell me tell me
well I was going to say that I was going to a concert in Madrid last year when I was there but I couldn´t go because
aha
eh it was exactly the day of the attempt
Oh God what a bad luck
from from yes I was arriving by train to Madrid the same hour that it happened
uh uh that kind of well that kind of
then they stopped the train and we stayed there like three hours waiting
okay okay okay uh how bad
that must have been very hard right ? 
yes yes yes
and we saw all the people in Barcelona were in the streets
yes it was was
supporting and it was was very nice very tough
was very tough really yeas they were some moments
yes yes
very I don't know ,  very tragic but
yes there eh eh we were in a hotel in the center of the city and we looked out the window and there was like a sea of people ,  thousands and thousands in the streets raining just all
mm ,  mm yes yes
all of them together it was very nice ,  yes
yes and well it was a tragedy but well what happened after
yes sure eh
I think that it was well for the country the reaction there was
was like a union for the country also
yes yes yes low
because in all the cities there were demonstrations right ? 
Yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  it was ,  i don't know ,  a very strong global reaction ¿right ?  ,  because ,  well ,  it was really
Yeah ,  it was amazing ,  yeah ,  amazing
Nothing like that had ever happened before ,  ¿right ?  ,  and besides ,  all the attempts of political manipulation there were and
Yeah ,  sure
And people realized that and
Yes
And they went out to protest too ,  ¿right ?  ,  so
unbelievable
well ,  it was a complicated moment ,  but within the tragedy ,  it was ,  i don't know ,  you realize that people can really do something ¿right ? 
Yeah ,  exactly
Yes ,  we can express our opinion and
Exactly ,  and that's something i think it's lacking here in the United States
Yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  definitely
Of course it does ,  if they can there in Spain
Uh huh ,  uh huh
Yes
And now in Brazil since there's the thing with Lula
Oh ,  Brasil ,  it's
because i heard that the people was a little bit disappointed ,  ¿right ? 
No ,  it's horrible ,  there's a terrible corruption scandal
yes yes or something like this
and what came out now and the government is completely paralyzed because they're chasing all the senators and deputies
yea yea yea
they're all in the ,  they were united in this corruption scheme
oh yeah
that was discovered so ,  Lula didn't know anything ,  they said that Lula didn't know the whole plot ,  but the government is completely paralyzed . 
hmm hmm yeah oh well it's a pity ,  no ?   Because it seems like people were disillusioned and
yes it was really good ,  I was really happy in the workers group
hmm
because the first time he came to power and he was always part of honesty ,  for workers and
sure ,  sure
to have because in Brazil there's always many workers against the elitists
hmm ,  hmm
and the government ,  the president ,  and the party in power ,  it was always the elitists ,  not the
hmm
not liberalism so ,  eh ,  well the workers party came to power and after this happened you lost faith in the party

no the elections will now be in
next year maybe or
it will be in the next few years

Yes ,  the thing is that ,  well ,  since we already know them ,  we'll do them by memory next time
Right ,  we already know that ,  but yeah
Yes ,  because you have to press your ,  your pin code
Right
And then hit the key ,  uh ,  the ,  the ,  what they call the pound
Right
The ,  i meant by pound ,  but it's the 'sharp' [key]
Oh ,  i didn't understood what he said ,  'pound'
it's sharp ,  i mean ,  instead of asterisk
Right
It's that little square you have on the phone ,  the sharp
Right
Well ,  that one ,  you give your pin and the sharp ,  and then it asks you if you're using a mobile phone ,  well ,  a cellphone
Right
Well ,  you hit one and it's a ,  i don't know ,  if it's a fixed line you hit the two ,  or i don't know ,  and then ,  if you're using an earpiece

I'm telling him ,  you took me to Panama and he'd say ,  you took me there ,  I was remembering the clothes and all of that ,  like you know ,  I'd laugh
With the songs that they make . 
Oh my mother used to love that man .  Boy George . 
Oh yes .  I've seen it ,  he  looks like someone had placed a melted candle over his head . 
Who ? 
Boy George
When ? 
He doesn't have hair ,  he has something like a
Oh . 
candle ,  like if they had placed a candle over his black head and his face had melted .

When we were
Now that they say he's become white ah
yes ,  he has a disease that that ,  that puts your skin it takes the pigmentation out
Really
yes it puts it white . 
Mm . 
I had family that I have family to whom that's happened .  But that man well he's another one that has gone from bad to worse . 
Yes ,  is true . 
Before with the surgery ,  I say ,  perhaps a little but now he has gotten he doesn't look real
And the nose ,  it looks already like plastic .

And ,  the nose he had
Um
But now
And when ,  when he was ,  that song ,  like Thriller
Oh ,  yeah
he looked good there . 
I like that song .  Mm . 
But all of a sudden he changed

Are there a lot of Latins there ? 
many Latins ,  many many .  Just today is the ,  the um
Yes
the ,  the declaration of independence Mexican group
Aha ,  ok ,  right ,  yes
aha ,  it was today
Hello ,  good afternoon . 
Hello ,  good afternoon ,  who am I talking too ? 
Josefina in Philadelphia ,  and what's your name ? 
Oh Silvia ,  I'm also in Philadelphia . 
Oh ,  Silvia ,  what a coincidence . 
yes yes in
well ,  I'm so glad to meet you
me too ,  what was your name again ? 
Josefina
Oh ,  Josefina ,  oh
aha
one of my aunts ,  she has a birthday today and her name is Josefina too . 
Oh wow ,  but it's not my birthday today . 
yes , 
and are you ,  oh oh ,  have you made a lot of calls ,  have they called you a  lot as part of this program ? 
yes yes ,  I've received a lot of calls oh ,  this ,  oh
that's good
this is the sixth or seventh one ,  I get calls everyday around this time
wow ,  that's good ,  so they might keep on calling us then
yes oh oh oh ,  is this your first call ? 
no ,  is the second ,  yes
aha ,  the second ,  when did you start ? 
ah I think that because yesterday it didn't go in but I think that the day before yes
mm ,  mm
yes ,  but they go ,  go adding people I think day by day no because there are many people that tell me that it's their first call
ah interesting ,  I I think that they were not calling me every day and I think that perhaps they even go in alphabetical order because my last name starts with A
ah yes but mine is r
is very good yes and
they combine one with the other perhaps ,  yes
aha ,  um
and also that we have participated before in some other studies I think
aha
they have done ah I know of one but there are people that have already participated in two others
eh eh I know they did this one last year because
aha
my son participated and I signed up and then I didn't make any calls and later I would say how dumb I had been
ah
that I never made time to do it
but sometimes ,  ah well I wait for them to call me oh but if one can also call too
one can call I think that last year I had said that for them not to call me but rather that I would call and at the end I never did
Oh
And in the end i missed it and then i said "why was i so dumb ? "
Oh ,  yeah ,  imagine that ,  but you don't know what you're gonna do
Um
suddenly you thought you were going to make the calls and you didn't ,  ¿right ? 
that thing where you get home from work and you say "oh ,  no ,  I'm tired ,  I'll do it tomorrow" ,  yeah ,  and
"i'll do it later" ,  yeah ,  and later on it goes by
it goes by ,  and away ,  yes ,  yes
I tried on Saturday and i called many times and they never got anyone
Oh ,  ¿really ?  ,  i think it's better
right
when you wait until they call you
Uh ,  it seems to be easier during the week too
Yeah ,  i have been calling almost like a clock ,  they call me at six in the afternoon
Like one ,  yeah ,  fixed ,  me too ,  like they've spotted me already
Yes
at this hour ,  because both calls are at this hour
Yeah ,  and ,  right ,  yes ,  and maybe there's ,  in the computer ,  the program is set in a way that if they see someone picks up
and they get to him easily ,  so keep calling that person
They keep track of him ,  exactly ,  reaching him more often
aha ,  aha
that to the one who's never there and to the one who is that the computer knows ,  right ? 
exactly yes yes yes because at the end they want to reach people ,  right ? 
ah yes what surprises me is ,  even though I put after six they've called in the daytime and my dad is here in the house and he says
ah but they are calling too much from a place and he explains to me and is this ,  no
aha ,  aha
and I say why do they call in the daytime if I told them after six always
yes and I say because that recording who is somebody who speaks English so badly
ah yes
eh I mean the Spanish that there are so many people there who could read the text of the day and why do they use that person that doesn't speak Spanish
they don't speak anything what they say one imagines what they are speaking but when they say if you wish to continue in the how is it that they say ,  apoyadero in the
says I don't there are things that I don't understand ,  yes
goodness I say what's apoyadero
yes ,  yes ,  yes
but I imagine that it means in the in the station or in the but is super funny because
yes yes yes yes yes
and now you press I don't know what ,  everything backwards ,  right
yes ,  yes no and when they explain if such of a phone of this type do this if not do this other
ah
and I don't understand what ,  I don't understand his description . 
exactly ,  if it is a cellphone first but I don't know that mine is the third one
aha
and then for him ,  I put the other option ,  I have the fourth one
oh ha
because it's a normal cellphone
yes yes
and the headphones
yes yes
the  buttons in the ears and all of that
yes
and I think that when I'm getting to where it says regular ,  there I'm
aha aha yes
the cable telephone and you take it with the hands ,  no
yes yes yes ,  look ,  where are you from ? 
oh that's nice ,  I was born in Venezuela but we've been here since around twenty five years ago . 
Oh
yes ,  a long time ago ,  where are you from ? 
I'm from Cuba . 
Oh ,  that's nice . 
yes yes ,  I'm here ,  in the outskirts of Montgomery county
aha
in in
oh okay ,  it's really quiet over there
mhm ,  mhm ,  mhm
and I'm in Philadelphia well ,  not downtown but yes
mm
a bit to the north east ,  in the north east
mhm ,  mhm ,  mhm
and have you been here for long ? 
well ,  in the United States ,  yes but in Philadelphia for eight
aha ,  oh well I have been here for more time ,  a bit more but you get used to it ,  right ? 
yes aha
as the time goes by I'd like to live in Florida but it has so many hurricanes nowadays . 
oh yes
I don't know why but they are pretty common now ,  the tornadoes . 
yes look ,  with the cyclones ,  every ten years they destroy the homes and that's a lot . 
oh ,  it is a lot ,  to loose everything
mhm ,  mhm
and you have to be ,  have hope ,  right ? 
oh yes
although it doesn't happen to a lot of people but you know ,   how can you know that it's not going to happen to you ,  right ? 
yes although ,  although if it happens to you for five years in a row ,  in the sixth year ,  you don't end up winning
sure ,  that's the truth ,  oh my God and and what do you think about cellphone ?  I didn't really understand the questions ,  I think it is convenient that we use them in
public places ,  the cellphone ,  I think that's what he meant to say
well ,  I know that somewhere it seemed to me that it had to do with terrorist using
oh yes
cellphones to ignite bombs
oh my god ,  just imagine it
in a way ,  I don't know how it is
what type of question is that ? 
they call the cellphone and
mhm ,  oh
they start a mechanism that ignites the bomb
I I believe that for us ,  it's not a subject that we could discuss because ,  myself ,  I'm older
and I really use it very little ,  no ? 
yes
and I don't know the use ,  yes ,  they have a screen ,  to do this or that
m
so ,  to me ,  that's like if they asked me how to operate a spaceship board I wouldn't know anything about it either ,  no
yes ,  like that ,  yes
so I don´t know I know that it causes me a little bit of strangeness that people discuss their things in public ,  that looks to me strange
That they discuss things in public ? 
by ,  with the cell phone on their hands
hmm
but they talk even about the money the owe they talk about the ,  the dates
what ,  oh
with girlfriend I don´t ,  on the street ,  I don´t
I have not hear those conversations
yes I  feel so amazed yesterday I think so I was in a restaurant or something like that they were there talking about things you even don´t mention at home you don´t
 want to be heard ,  right
but how indiscreet are people ,  right ? 
oh and they were talking very aloud lets say the volume ,  right
yes ,  yes yes yes
all that very unexpected because in front of people I would not talk not in public or in public telephones because you can be heard
yes and now they yell on the phone
they yell it and maybe you don´t take the bus but guagua like it is called here but in those buses they talk about everything
hmm ,  what a thing
on the phone and then they are five ,  six passengers talking on the phone and fighting
and that is all things without importance
aha
there are so many people that use the cell phone for absolutely unimportant things
that they could talk it while they got home or things like that
yes yes yes and one feels that the cellular should be saved for more important things rather than to pass the time
well sure exactly I thought that the function was that that if there is an emergency
mm
that they are going to do something to you you call the police quickly things like that but
yes I have one that is for that purpose ,  nowadays
ah God
it already seems eh that the companies have seen that there's a certain demand for that and they are starting to come out with plans where one pays according to what they use
that's very good
yes and then one always pays a little more for the minute but eh
ah but basically the emergency use for example
eh yes eh that allows me ,  I today don't work outside the house and when I stopped working outside of the house
my cellular stopped being necessary for me
ah sure
and and and then what I changed but I didn't want to stay I didn't want to be paying thirty ,  forty dollars a month
mm
eh eh just to have something to call the police or triple A
aha
and also I didn't want to stay with nothing and then I started exploring and I found a plan where you keep the phone but you only pay as you use the time
and that with minutes purchases ,  you buy that
one ,  yes you buy it beforehand
ah okay
one pays them
with ,  whatever for example twenty five dollars and until that runs out
right ,  whatever you want beforehand aha ,  yes this plan is with Virgin ,  Mobile then one ,  one
ah
pays by credit card a certain amount and then one talks until you use that up and then one deposits money again with them ,  that one
mm mm
can do it like that or put in a plan where when the amount goes down eh gets to five dollars ,  they go to the credit card and put more
aha ,  ah okay
eh but that gives me what I want to pay very little money to have a cellular for an emergency
that's good because one gets very lazy with the cellular because you start calling to ask dumb things
Good afternoon
Good afternoon
I'm Joe ,  ¿what's your name ? 
Yolanda ,  you can call me Yoly [pronounced Jolie]
Jolie
Yes
W  ,  ¿where do you live ,  Jolie ? 
Here in Texas ,  ¿and you ? 
I live here in Colorado
Oh ,  oh ,  well ,  almost near
Well ,  uh ,  yes ,  not too far ,  not too far
No
Well ,  the subject we'll be talking about is cellphones .  I'm not a friend of them ,  i used it for a long time ,  and i got tired of using it ,  because really ,  wherever i went ,  it was always ringing and it took my privacy away too much
Yes
And ,  ¿do you have one ? 
No ,  yes ,  even the ,  uh ,  last month i got a bill ,  a super expensive one
Yeah ,  that's the other thing ,  that you never know when you're over your minutes ,  and suddenly ,  you get some calls ,  some terrible bills
Exactly ,  yes ,  i got sixty nine dollars ,  and my plan is ¿what ?  ,  two hundred minutes ,  but well , 
Yes
And i didn't even noticed i talked too much ,  for so long ,  but well
Is this the only phone that you use or do you have one at home too ? 
it went out ,  No ,  we have one in the house ,  I'm using the houses phone right now
Oh . 
yes ,  no . 
yes ,  I used mine for a long time and
Did you use it for work or just to call your friends ? 
I remember ,  to ,  to talk to ,  to be easily contacted but ,  I think I don't need it .  I lived without it for so long ,  without cellphones . 
And I don't think it's necessary for me to have one ,  like
yes ,  it's
the man said during the question ,  he said that in restaurants it bothers people when you are eating and they start ringing ,  when they are in the movies and they start ringing
No ,  that's so true .  In the movies ,  it seems to me that ,  people should be responsible in terms of when they go to the movies they should turn off their phones . 
yes . 
It's a public place and they are ,  oh ,  they are thinking about ,  I mean ,  going to watch a movie and not to talk to someone on the phone . 
Exactly ,  yes ,  that's right .  It's disrespectful .  We ,  in the company I work in ,  we have had ,  meetings in which are talking and then suddenly ,  a phone starts ringing ,  the cellphone , 
oh ,  that's horrible .  It's disrespectful . 
No ,  that's so true .  and usually ,  I rarely use it .  But ,  lately ,  my sister has had problems with it ,  she calls me and she loves to talk so ,  that's why I received such a huge bill . 
Two hundred and fifty minutes is so little ,  can't you pick a five hundred minute plan or something like that ? 
Well ,  oh ,  it'll cost me around eight hundred dollars per month ,  so ,  I say ,  it's
Really ?  That much ? 
yes ,  well ,  no . 
Have you already checked other companies ? 
I've looked ,  but ,  eh ,  I still haven't decided which one .  I think that one of five hundred minutes ,  like you say ,  they wanted to charge me
yes
thirty nine plus ,  well ,  tax . 
yes . 
So ,  I don't know how much it would be in total .  It's just that ,  I don't bring myself up to it . 
yes ,  the standard ,  is ,  here in Colorado ,  is like thirty nine for five hundred minutes . 
A ,  that's good . 
And ,  and then ,  there are may companies competing for the same price . 
And ,  that is what they say .  Right ?  But later ,  with the taxes ,  and fees , 
yes ,  yes ,  Right ?  they put additional charges ,  that
exactly . 
they don't explain well yes
yes ,  yes .  And is ,  one comes out with a bill of eighty without knowing . 
yes ,  is true .  Plus the phone itself ,  is not cheap .  Because ,  many ,  they put through your eyes ,  phones that have ,  that take pictures and things like that . 
Oh ,  yes . 
And ,  one that falls in love with that ,  then ,  spends even more money . 
yes . 
Doesn't realize that yes ,  for each picture that you send by phone ,  is also an additional charge . 
Besides the minutes ,  is it also a charge ? 
Yes ,  yes
Oh ,  i didn't notice
It's included in many companies ,  in others
Uh
But ,  uh ,  that counts ,  and ,  they charge that to you too
You know ,  my boyfriend has ,  the Nextel service has worked for him
Nextel ,  yes
For ,  right ,  yeah ,  to talk .  Because ,  well ,  we're here ,  near the border ,  we're next to Mexico ,  to Juarez
Yes
So ,  uh ,  he can talk to people there just like that ,  well ,  with ,  uh ,  his cellphone and they don't charge him ,  well ,  ¿right ?  ,  that
international ,  ¿right ? 
Yes ,  i don't know ,  that's international
Yes ,  yes
But ,  uh ,  yes ,  that's what happened to me ,  I'm from Puerto Rico
Oh
And ,  uh ,  i also used it like that before
Uh huh
And i called my father on the plan
Yes
So ,  Puerto Rico was included in the plan ,  so
Ah ,  how smooth . 
it came out like yes ,  the same as if I made a local call . 
yes ,  And ,  well ,  for ,  ah ,  How do you say land line in Spanish ? 
The ground line ,  yes .  x
Line in the ground . 
yes
Eh ,  to call Puerto Rico or Mexico ,  ah ,  is so expensive . 
yes ,  is true . 
So ,  that is something
My daughter went to Mexico recently .  And ,  her mom uses a cellular ,  but didn't use it there .  But ,  the call for the state of Oaxaca ,  is not cheap at all . 
Ah ,  no I can imagine . 
It cost ,  cost a lot of money . 
Ah , 
And ,  and ,  How is Texas these days ? 
Ah ,  right now is very nice ,  the sun is still out . 
yes ,  here too ,  is really nice .  What ,  what ,  what part of Texas do you live in ? 
Is ,  um ,  ah ,  is ,  El Paso ,  immediately after Mexico ,  of Juarez . 
Oh .  El Paso ,  yes .  The last time that I was in El Paso , 
yes . 
was like more than ten ,  or fifteen years ago ,  I believe . 
Ah . 
yes that is hot over there . 
Oh ,  yes ,  yes .  The summers are very hot . 
Very hot .  And are you from the City of Juarez ? 
No ,  no .  I'm from here from ,  from El Paso .  My mom is American ,  and my dad is Mexican . 
Oh . 
yes ,  yes . 
And you speak both languages ? 
yes . 
how good
Eh ,  I learned ,  ah ,  when I listened ,  I was already older .  But ,  well yes I learned . 
how good ,  how good ,  yes .  It's a necessity ,  and an advantage ,  to speak both languages ,  also . 
Oh ,  yes .  That's for sure . 
And what was the company that you used for the cellular ? 
Um ,  now I have Alltel ,  I think is called . 
What is it called ? 
Alltel
Ah ,  I don't know it .  Do you have mobile over there ? 
Have ,  what ? 
Eh ,   T Mobile is what they call it ,  eh . 
yes ,  there is  Tmobile ,  my sister told me that ,  ah ,  they had a good plan .  But ,  I haven't informed myself good . 
yes ,  I had a good plan with them too
To kn 
But I got bored of the cellular .  Wherever I was ,  I was getting called all the time
It is a matt 
you have to enjoy ,  at least a little ,  being alone ,  without all that technology
No ,  yes .  No ,  it's true .  My boyfriend was always on the cellphone .  We went to New York ,  and there he was on the cellphone ,  I said enough ,  come on
yes ,  yes .  And ,  mm ,  look at the traffic ,  it makes me mad ,  how can people drive and talk by the phone at the same time ? 
And ,  they do it for such a long time .  I can't ,  I get too nervous .  I don't make calls ,  or don't drive
yes  , yes ,  I don't coordinate too well ,  driving and talking ,  when I did it on the cellular .  So I said ,  no ,  that's not a good idea for me
No ,  no
But I have seen people talking
MHm
driving ,  and eating
No ,  oh no .  That either
at the same time .  I wonder how they can do it ,  but
I have tried to paint my lips ,  and no
you have to be crazy to do that .  And yes ,  yes ,  once I saw an accident related to the cell phone
Really ? 
of the person ,  eh ,  the woman was not looking to side she was turning to
Aha
and another car was coming ,  so she hit him ,  you know . 
Oh no
And then ,  because She had ,  the phone was blocking her face
You see . 
in the left side you know ,  and She didn't She didn't see him coming
and I'm sure that that lady is still using the cellphone . 
I'm sure she was telling her husband ,  hey ,  someone just hit my car or something . 
yes ,  she was like ,  they are going to hit me . 
No ,  those cellphone things ,  I remember I lost my brother about three years ago . 
Oh . 
And I remember that I had to call my whole family . 
Mhm . 
So ,  I had about five hundred minutes and I surpassed them ,  I spent about one hundred more minutes but I was calling my family from all over , 
yes . 
and when that bill came ,  I almost passed out . 
No ,  yes . 
It went up to around two hundred and fifty dollars . 
Oh no .  I remember when the cellphones first came out ,  we went to ,  to California ,  to Los Angeles . 
yes . 
And my boyfriend ,  without realizing ,  was talking on the cell phone ,  when we got back ,  the bill was three hundred and forty five . 
Oh my ,  This is , 
Imagine ,  he talked ,  and opened . 
that's really expensive . 
No ,  no .   The ,  they didn't tell me the roaming ,  they didn't warn be about this ,  I'm not going to pay . 
The roaming is another issue too .   When you're in places that isn't under the plan ,  you have to pay more for this . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes .   And and the beginning ,  when it came out ,  they didn't really tell us about this . 
And you pay a lot . 
We pay in the end . 
And when I had the T Mobile plane ,  I got familiar with it .  I said ,  what parts of the United states did I think of being in ?   And how to cover these parts ?   So ,  I also included
Puerto Rico ,  to see how they covered Puerto Rico .   And I said ,  ah ,  this is better for me than other plans . 
Ah . 
But ,  here there's a lot ,  Do they have cricket over there ? 
yes ,  yes ,  there is .   There aren't many ,  but yes there's a little . 
Here they sell ,  eh ,  it's like more ,  affordable ,  I think . 
Ah . 
I'm not really familiar with it ,  but I know that people don't want to spend a lot on ,  on the telephone ,  or bills ,  eh ,  they're the most affordable .   The service doesn't assure you .   Because ,  I had . 
ah ,  the T Mobile that I had ,  in some parts of the city ,  the connection was terrible . 
yes ,  here there are some places ,  that they say like
yes ,  that were
that you lose ,  eh ,  the call ,  yes . 
knocks out the call .  yes ,  is by where the antennas are .  if they are not too close , 
Mm . 
I remember ,  on a trip that I went driving to Kansas to visit my family ,  there were some really widespread areas where they didn't have those towers ,  and , 
well ,  it would disconnect ,  the call would disconnect .  You could hear ,  really ,  really bad . 
No .  yes . 
And here in Denver ,  that happens a lot .  Because ,  there are many towers ,  yes .  But ,  there are many people using cellulars ,  so ,  there's a lot of interference
Ah . 
and the calls get disconnected a lot . 
yes is true , 
But ,  I'm dumbfounded with all the people here that use the cellulars wherever .  And ,  I know ,  I'm ,  ah ,  my friends ,  tell me ,  How ,  is it that you don't have a cellular ? 
As if I was a person from another planet . 
Ah . 
That
No ,  well ,  eh ,  for a long time ,  nobody had .  And now ,  everybody has . 
yes , 
They find it strange ,  but ,  well , 
I remember the first ones that came out . 
Ah ,  yes .  Like big blocks . 
They were ,  were like some blocks ,  yes ,  they were really big .  I found that funny . 
yes . 
I remember a friend of mine ,  and that was something really innovative ,  everybody looking at him .  Wow ,  you have a cellular phone .  But ,  it looks ,  now ,  that is like a block . 
yes ,  is true .  And even ,  Do you remember the ghosts they had that were huge ? 
Oh ,  the antennas ,  yes . 
yes ,  . 
I also remember . 
It already looked like it was going to be ,  ah ,  that ,  ah How do you say it ?  That a plane would come down by
I remember that I had one like that ,  also .  Because ,  when they started to come out ,  I was also one of the first to get it .  And ,  well ,  I had it for a while .  But , 
I got tired ,  I got tired .  I don't want it anymore ,  unless is something ,  something very necessary for me ,  I don't think I'm going to have a cellular again . 
No ,  well , 
With the phone in the house and the phone in the office ,  that ,  for me ,  is enough . 
And ,  one ,  if one wants to meet with someone ,  one meets ,  mm ,  one way or another .  You don't need to be carrying it . 
Sure ,  sure .  There always is .  Exactly ,  exactly .  Ah ,  that was the other thing ,  charging the batteries ,  and changing the batteries ,  and all those things . 
Oh ,  yes . 
And ,  I had ,  I had a collection of
Bessy
Bessy ,  I'm Tammy ,  i can't believe it ,  three ,  three times
Yes
Hey ,  we're gonna have to buy the lottery
Yeah ,  they don't want to
Because ,  well ,  look
I can't believe it
Oh ,  it's very funny ,  i can't believe it
it's so funny ,  that bone
Oh ,  oh no ,  everybody called me today
¿Huh ? 
everybody called me today ,  that's funny ,  my phone has been ringing all day long
Oh ,  thank god ,  no one has called me
Oh ,  well ,  no ,  well ,  oh ,  ¿what do they want ? 
Right
Well ,  so ,  ¿what do you think about cellphones ? 
Oh ,  i like them ,  but ,  ¿huh ? 
I think ,  yeah ,  i think that ,  i like them too ,  i don't have one
¿You don't ? 
No ,  i used to ,  but now ,  since i don't use it that much
Oh .  Aha . 
so no , 
Why be paying ? 
I don't want to be paying . 
Mm . 
But ,  yes ,  sometimes is annoying ,  people that talk   are in the restaurant ,  and talk quite
Oh ,  in the movie theater . 
loud .  Or in the movies ,  ah ,  yes ,  that does get me ,  because
Ah . 
they start talking ,  or playing with the phone ,  when you are watching the movie . 
Mm .  Yes ,  is true ,  And in the restaurant ,  is also very annoying . 
Ah ,  yes . 
Mm . 
Incredible ,  the people that never think or when they are driving on the freeway . 
That's even worse . 
That is worse ,  I say ,  but ,  listen ,  you are seeing that it's three in the afternoon ,  the freeway is full , 
Mm . 
and ,  and you are ,  are driving with the phone like that kind of stuck on the ,  on ,  on the shoulder ,  I say ,  no man ,  can't you wait a little
Yes ,  is true .  I ,  ah , 
and talk with someone ? 
when I'm ,  and this ,  when I'm with my cellphone , 
Mhm . 
I have oh ,  for the ,  in the ,  the earpiece
Aha
to put the ,  to have both hands in the wheel . 
Aha
So ,  I get like ,  I get this thing in the head
Oh ,  yes ,  I know . 
to listen to
Aha . 
instead of taking it with the hands ,  to put it like ,  in your shoulder
yes ,  the car ,  we have the car ,  the car on star . 
Oh ,  I see ,  aha . 
so ,  it also includes the cellphone ,  so , 
Oh ,  that's nice . 
you press a button and you say who you want to talk to and you are driving and talking at the same time ,  at the same time
Aha . 
So ,  it's better than having your phone in the hands ,  or or it's also good to have what you have
Mhm ,  I see . 
that way you keep both hands in the wheel . 
Yes
In the wheel
Uh huh
To be able to be alright ,  but ,  there are people that don't ,  not even that . 
There's ,  there's a lot ,  there are many accidents
Yes
It's impossible ,  just driving with one hand ,  right ? 
Here in Washington ,  they say that if you cause an accident and you're ,  uh ,  using a phone ,  a cellphone
Uh huh
They give you a bigger ticket
Oh ,  really ? 
For causing it ,  because ,  it's incredible how these cellphones came out of China or Japan
Right
but it's illegal to drive with those phones there ,  but here we
Uh huh
They don't use the phone at the car ,  but we ,  crazy as we are ,  we can't wait a minute when we're out or stopping ,  we have to talk on the
on the car
Uh huh
But ,  if them ,  sometimes ,  sometimes i miss it ,  the cellphone ,  but sometimes i don't .  When there are important things ,  oh ,  i wish i had a cellphone right now . 
But ,  and sometimes ,  no ,  it's fine ,  no problem
No ,  I have my own ,  but it's just for emergency ,  that's it . 
yes . 
It has fifty minutes per month ,  I have . 
It's not that bad . 
I see . 
yes ,  we ,  my husband and I we went to this lake ,  what's its name ,  for holidays
Aha . 
for a week and I was laughing at my coworkers because ,  my boss he was like ,  hey could we give you a satellite phone ,  just in case ? 
And I was like ,  hey ,  I'm on holidays ,  tell them that
Oh God . 
Anyway ,  a ,  a cellphone ,  I mean ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no .  No . 
Oh no
We want something ,  I'm telling him ,  ask him before we go .  I always ,  he always tell them ,  don't call me ,  I'm on holidays ,  don't call me at my house because my wife is going to pick up the phone . 
And she's like ,  no . 
I see . 
But ,  they are always looking for you to give you more work ,  why don't you have a cellphone ?  And he's like ,  what for ?  So that you can call me at night when I'm driving home just to ask me something ?  No . 
I see ,  that's true . 
And he's like ,  they know that he has a car but they don't call him that much . 
Mhm . 
when he's in the car ,  they wait for him to get here or something . 
It's good ,  because it distracts also
Aha . 
one ,  driving ,  and the cellular ah ,  rings ,  I sometimes ,  ah ,  that happens to me , 
yes . 
ah ,  that happens to me .  Then ,  I have to park somewhere to be able to answer
Mm , 
because I don't like to be driving and talking
yes . 
so .  Okay ,  because 
yes ,  me too .  I also called my sister in ,  and she was in the car ,  and ah ,  I call you ,  the other one said ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  I said ,  Where are you ? 
She says ,  in .  Then ,  I say ,  call me when you get to the supermarket ,  because I can't talk to you like that .  Because ,  I say ,  you have my nephew ,  my nephew in the car and I don't want anything happening to you
Okay . 
talking to me . 
Yes ,  is true ,  yes . 
Eh ,  and later she called me .  Because ,  she was trying to make rice with chicken ,  I didn't know what she needed ,  and I was laughing . 
I say ,  now yes ,  so . 
Aha .  And she called you
the recipe .  Yes she called me there ,  that do you know ,  can  you give me the recipe ?  as if I had the recipe in my head ,  woman . 
yes ,  and I say ,  I don't make rice with chicken every day ,  and that ,  every once in a while . 
Ah ,  no .  Rice with chicken . 
Aha ,  my husband doesn't really like rice . 
Oh no ,  he doesn't like rice . 
No . 
Mm . 
Just once in a while I cook something that they call ,  chicken taco rice , 
Aha . 
and he eats it because it's a bit soft . 
Oh , 
So ,  oh ,  the only way ,  but he won't eat rice . 
And what does he eat then ,  potato ? 
Potatoes . 
Oh . 
Those he likes . 
I see .  My husband doesn't ,  when ,  my husband was married before , 
Aha . 
and his ex wife would only give him rice . 
Oh God . 
So he can't stand it now ,  I cook potatoes for him and rice just once on a while
Mhm . 
But ,  he sometimes like stir fry , 
Aha . 
that one must have rice ,  of course . 
Aha . 
It cannot be with potatoes .  But ,  that one is eaten . 
So it is .  Well ,  I make my rice ,  I tell him ,  I know you don´t like rice ,  but today I will make rice ,  and I say ,  What do you want with your meat or something like that ? 
Hmm . 
Because of that he tells me ,  he does not eat a lot ,  so he always says to me ,  ah ,  or ,  only the meat ,  or
Aha . 
give me bread ,  make your rice ,  he tells me .  Don´t worry ,  make your rice .  I say ,  okay . 
yeah
There is not problem ,  but my children do .  My son does ,  he likes rice . 
Ah ,  how good . 
They are rice . 
I am not the only one who eats rice .  Who eats rice . 
Aha ,  I don´t feel bad .

And ,  my little one is who wants now ,  changing the coversation ,  is ,  ah ? 
Little one ,  Is he fifteen ?  How old is the little one ? 
My little one is fifteen .

Yes ,  is . 
Aha

Okay . 
And he starts laughing ,  because ,  ah ,  I say ,  no ,  no ,  no .  Ah ,  yes .  that I saw one that was free .  I say ,  free for the phone ,  but ,  well ,  you have to get the contract ,  I say ,  I'm not going to sign the contract ,  because you are sixteen years old , 
Right ,  it's true ,  yeah ,  uh huh
fifteen years ,  i mean ,  you can't sign a contract
yeah ,  it's true
Uh ,  no ,  that it's free ,  i think ,  no ,   no ,  no ,  there it is ,  i think ,  i don't have a cellphone ,  ¿why would i give one to you ? 
Yeah ,  they should be just regular cellphones
Right
That ,  the ,  the ones who have cameras should be illegal
Yeah ,  the things people do with that
Uh huh
I was watching there once ,  ¿where was i ?  ,  i was at the mall and ,  uh ,  i was in front of a McDonald's here ,  inisde the mall
Uh huh
And there was a man sitting and some girls ,  like fifteen year old on the next table
Right
And they had some very small skirts ,  and you know these girls don't ,  sometimes they don't close their legs
Oh
And the man had the camera down ,  and taking pictures
¿How was that ? 
And it was like they didn't noticed ,  and i wen't for security and i told them "this man .  .  .

Ah , 
I told them ,  ,  I showed them who it was , 
Aha . 
and the police came ,  and took him out of the mall ,  because I told them ,  that's not fair .

I say ,  the girls are less than fifteen years old ,  and this thirty five year old man ,  pervert . 
Aha ,  okay
Doing things like that with the small girls .  I say ,  no ,  man ,  and they are there laughing ,  and would look at him ,  and didn't know exactly . 
And they didn't even realize it ?  And ,  no ,  did they realize that he was taking pictures . 
No .  They weren't ,  there they would look at him ,  and ,  they would make faces ,  and I don't know what . 
Oh . 
Of ,  like you are weird ,  so ,  like that they would look at him ,  but they didn't realize when they were looking the other way ,  he was taking the pictures . 
Aha ,  Ah ,  no ,  that
And after ,  he would look ,  and I would say ,  look at that ,  what a swine ,  and nobody and I say ,  I always tell my son ,  you have to be sure of what's around you .

I say ,  Why do they have ? 
Okay
My sister has one of those ,  she has never ,  never has been of those that takes so many pictures ,  only three ,  no ,  four pictures that she sent me ,  because I already was driving her crazy when she moved over there to Maine . 
AHa .

Aha ,  okay . 
She goes to the store and develops them and there she told me ,  no that she has developed and she had send me a few . 
Aha . 
But ,  no ,  that of the phone ,  I say ,  for what ? 
No ,  but ,  there ,  there are those cellulars with cameras ,  but they should only sell them to the adults . 
Aha . 
And ,  eighteen years old doesn't mean that you are already an adult , 
No
to me ,  it's still a little boy at eighteen
Um ,  uh huh ,  yes
Like a thirty and up one ,  i think
Yeah ,  because
They should sell ,  if they want this kind of cellphones ,  so ,  well ,  sell them to them ,  but the ,  um ,  well ,  that man is also a pervert
Uh huh
who knows
I cant' like that ,  but there are also people that are extreme ,  the other day i was at the .  .  .  i saw a six year old girl
Her mom was on the cellphone ,  and the little girl had a cellphone
The little girl too
¿What do you do ?  ,  the six year old girl with a cellphone

OK
Yeah ,  well ,  ¿where are you from ? 
Uh ,  i was born in Puerto Rico
Right
But my fathers are Dominican and ,  uh ,  we moved to the United States when i was five years old
Yeah ,  i mean ,  you've practically lived here your whole life ,  ¿right ? 
Yes
Yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  well ,  I'm from Spain
¿And you ?  ,  oh ,  wow
Yeah ,  I'm from Madrid ,  besides ,  yeah ,  well ,  i'm on the bus ,  ¿can you hear me well ? 
Yes ,  yes
Well ,  we have to talk about mobile phones ,  ¿right ?  ,  well ,  cellphones
Yes
That here in the United States they call them cellphones
Yes
In Spain we call them mobile phones ,  but it's the same
Yeah ,  it's the same
Yes ,  mobile phones ,  well look ,  i i love the cellphone ,  it's
once again ,  ¿what did you say ?  ,  i didn't hear you ,  I'm sorry
¿Hello ?  ,  no ,  that i ,  uh ,  i love to use the cellphone ,  I'm completely addicted to the cellphone
Yeah ,  i like it ,  uh ,  the only thing i don't like is that i have to pay to use it
Oh ,  well ,  yeah ,  it's ,  it's a mess ,  it's a ,  it's a scam ,  the cellphone ,  you pay a lot of money
Yeah ,  uh
but you know in ,  in Spain when I've been here a year only ,  you know
there ,  aha
But in Spain there's I mean here it also exist but not as developed the pay as you go you know ,  the
yes , 
The rechargeable phones , 
yes , 
Then I always used ,  I had one of those the phones with contract ,  you know , 
aha
And then and always knew what I was spending because ,  because what I did was go to an automatic teller to an  ATM which they call here
aha
and then I could recharge the mobile phone ,  in intervals of twenty of twenty two ,  well twenty euros .  You know , 
aha
and when the balance ran out Well already ,  so nothing ,  so I had it I would stay without being able to call I could receive calls ,  Because it doesn't cost to receive calls , 
in Spain
Wow
No ,  it doesn't cost ,  No ,  it doesn't cost anything ,  you only only pay when you receive ,  when you make the call
That's good , 
is very good ,  when I came here they told me that to receive calls also also ,  you also have to pay ,  well I said how awful
Wow ,  that would be good here . 
yes yes ,  that would be very good ,  but here no ,  here it can't be ,  and then nothing ,  you did it like that ,  and then I would recharge recharge the
Lets say ,  the chip ,  the mobile phone with the
Right
With the credit card ,  you know
right
and ,  uh ,  and so i could control how much money i spent
Right
But i still spent a lot of money too ,  huh
Yes
And another thing that's different about mobile phones in Europe ,  in general ,  is that people uses text messages a lot more ,  you know
right
More than here ,  people don't use them much here ,  ¿right ? 
Oh ,  i don't use it much but that's because they also charge me
Yeah ,  sure ,  they also charge for that
For that ,  yeah ,  that's why i don't use it
Yeah ,  sure
To me ,  since i have a small company ,  it's easier for me to mace a call
Right
Than being ,  you know ,  trying to ,  to write what i want to say
Sure ,  sure , 
Many times i need to have a hand on the phone and the other one with the girl
Oh ,  and ,  ¿is she very little ? 
She's twenty months old
Oh ,  that's nice ,  that's nice ,  and ,  ¿is it your first daughter ? 
Yes ,  and
¿is it your first child ? 
Uh ,  a daughter ,  and we're going to have another in November
¿you're having another ? 
yes
¡Oh my .  ,  ¡oh my .  ,  well ,  you've taken it seriously ,  huh
Yes
No ,  i mean the maternity ,  it's very good ,  I'm very glad ,  congratulations
Thank you
You must be so excited about your girl ,  ¿right ? 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  uh ,  it was a blessing of god ,  we never thought we could have children and
Oh ,  i mean ,  you were expecting it a long time ago ,  i mean ,  you had tried to have children many times
Nothing ,  no ,  because of a ,  uh ,  medical condition i have ,  we didn't think we could
Oh ,  yeah ,  yeah
And ,  after twelve years of being married
Yes
I just got that
Oh ,  that's good
So ,  after that ,  you know ,  we wanted to have a brother or little sister ,  we don't know what it is yet
I see
You know ,  God blessed us with another one so
that's good ,  hey ,  my sincerest ,  congratulations ,  eh ,  I mean ,  a child is always a blessing a joy and an illusion ,  but
I can imagine that to you ,  it's even more than that ,  right ? 
yes ,  yes ,  we are so happy , 
Sure ,  that's right ,  congratulations ,  I'm really happy for you
yes
I have ,  I have ,  a nephew ,  my sister has
Aha
a son and it was a blessing ,  he's the only nephew I have
aha
because we are a small family ,  I only have one sister and one brother
aha
but my brother doesn't have kids and my sister ,  well ,  she only has one boy ,  I mean ,  he's the only nephew I got ,  you can imagine how spoiled he is
and ,  a profound joy ,  when he was born ,  a big joy and when he was born we all went crazy for him
aha
So ,  I can imagine that ,  I mean ,  I can imagine that you won't have time to do anything else ,  because of the girl ,  sure
no ,  not much
Were you working outside of the house before or ? 
Ah ,  yes ,  for a while I was a teacher of Special Education
well Education ,  excuse me
Special ,  for the kids who have
special ,  aha
problems
yes ,  yes yes ,  yes ,  yes
and eh ,  after a time I stopped working because eh ,  my husband was working
yes
eh ,  a schedule that was completely different to mine
Sure
So if I wanted to see him
Sure ,  sure
I couldn't see him because I worked from eight to four and he worked from twelve to nine
Sure
And we didn't see each other . 
Sure ,  sure ,  sure
So for this reason I stopped working
Yeah and ,  anyway ,  I imagine that also with your daughter you couldn't now either ,  no ?   Work
No ,  no ,  no it's possible
And more ,  more with the other too
Well I do want to put her yes yes I want to I can try to put her in Day care but for me And why am I going to pay to someone
That teach her when I have the education to do so . 
Of coursse Of course ,  of course ,  of course ,  you don´t have to and you would prefer to stay with the girl more than a strange person ,  of course
yes , 
of course ,  of course that thing in Spain when mothers have to come back to work after the delivery
yes , 
and they have to let the children in a place that they don´t know if they are going to take a good care of them You know ,  so young and still they
so ,  they have to wear diapers and they have to be fed and that is very sad ,  my sister was lucky that
my mother ,  the mother could took care of the child ,  you know Then ,  well the grandmother took care of him until he was old enough to go to school
but ,  if you don´t have someone or a relative able to take care of your ,  of your girl ,  it is a lot better for you to stay with her
yes , 
I am happy ,  yes I am happy ,  you have told me ,  she is twenty months old Does she walks ?  Right ? 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  walks ,  run
yeah ,  ouch ,  how good
she climbs and goes all the place around
Oh ,  what a happiness what a happiness ,  well .  Wait until she begins to touch everything and you will need to be very aware of everything that she doesn´t find any danger and that stuff Right ? 
yes specially when we go out , 
Of course , 
Not so much at home ,  because I have her ,  you know ,  eh that ,  she can´t she can harm herself or whatever ,  and I close the door of the rooms I don´t want her to go in . 
aha ,  aha ,  sure
But when we go out she is very curious and likes touching everything ,  and ,  and  ,  wants to be in top of everything ,  so it's a little difficult
normal ,  that's logical ,  and what's her name ? 
Sara Rebeca
Rebeca ,  what a nice name .  I had a friend in Spain named Rebeca ,  I loved her so much ,  I still love her of course .  Now we don't have that much contact ,  but yet
my friend Rebeca ,  I'm so happy for your girl .  Ans is she ,  is she very .  .  ?  Is she good ?  does she eat well ?  and cry a lot ? 
yes ,  she ,  she is very good
yes
she has her moments ,  like all kids do ,  but she is very good .  I
I see
to me ,  I think that ,  that there are not bad kids but parents who don't know how to deal with them .  So
I see ,  well anyway ,  you never know ,  my nephew for instance ,  he was a naughty boy
and when he was little there was no stopping him ,  eh ,  he would finish with the patience of Saint Jos
He was ,  he was naughty already ,  but it's true that boys may be more restless
yes ,  that I've heard
girls are usually more quiet ,  besides they are healthier than boys ,  and everything in general
Yes ,  that I've heard ,  so
So girls are raised much easily ,  they are nicer ,  cleaner ,  everything ,  boys are a disaster ,  even when they grow up
oh good ,  listen and your husband must be delighted as well
yes ,  yes ,  and what are you doing here in the United States ? 
sorry ? 
He brought it .  What do you do here in the United States ? 
Ah Well I'm studying ,  I'm here in in ,  eh ,  in Penn ,  in the University of Pennsylvania
Ah ,  how nice
yes ,  I'm doing the doctorate in chemistry
In chemistry . 
yes ,  chemistry
That was
I've been ,  I've been a year I'm already in my second year
And how much do you have left ? 
I still have a lot left because the program is five years ,  in other words
Wow
I still have four years left ,  Ah ,  so I'm going how they say in Spain ,  I'm going to become Americanized
Wow
yes But ,  but ,  look I'm fine here ,  at the beginning it was hard adapting but now I'm fine ,  I also have ,  my brother lives here in New York ,  you know
Ah ,  how nice
yes ,  he's been here already many years he's been here more than fifteen years already
Wow
And ,  well ,  also that was what you know what helped me decide what made me decide to come over here ,  to come to the United States ,  you know yes ,  I have a family here also
I know I have my brother and well ,  So that also ,  And we are very near ,  we are two hours in distance apart ,  you know ,  by bus
Do you know New York or Philadelphia ? 
No ,  never ,  well I know them ,  eh ,  let's say from television and what I've read in books ,  but I've never been able to go . 
yeah yeah well it's pretty ,  like the ,  I love New York ,  you know ,  it's a city ,  like ,  it's incredibly
Big and has everything and I'm sure ,  like I'm from a big city well I've always missed it ,  you know ,  I like cities ,  they cities don't overwhelm me . 
or the traffic jams or ,  you know ,  the opposite ,  I like it and Philadelphia is big too ,  it's a big city but sure it's not New York ,  you know ,  so sometimes , 
People say that it's bigger ,  but I think it's small ,  well ,  because it's not ,  not ,  like it's big ,  for the east coast ,  they say that
the third or the fourth biggest . 
wow ,  I didn't know this
But yes ,  it's the fifth biggest in the country
Well
Good af  good evening

aha
And if something ever happens with the car or something
Yes
because I have to call it ,  If someone comes to pick me up
An emergency ,  yes ,  yes
But I think that when they are talking on the phone and driving
yes
it's really dangerous
yes
And then ,  sometimes it gets me mad when someone is going talking to a store or a restaurant
Yes
Having talk on the phone ,  that gets me mad
Yes ,  yes ,  yes
Mmm
Specially if you have no consideration for the people in there
Yes ,  and
And also he was talking with some of the theather
oh ,  yes
It's supposed that if you go to the theater ,  you turn off your cellphone
I agree with that
Or Hospitals ,  if you go to a hospital ,  how are going to have the phone on ? 
aha
if it is not ,  if not is not allowed to use cellular phones in hospitals
oh ,  it is
because ,  here ,  in Illinois there is a law against driving the car and holding the phone in your hand
aha ,  well here
but ,  people keep doing it
yes ,  here you can even see policemen talking on the phone
yes ,  yes ,  yes
aha
it's true ,  it's true ,  they are first ones top do it
aha
and then they don't want you to do it
That's it
and cellular phones are good ,  like you said ,  for an emergency case or something that happens
aha
or ,  if you are in the street and you want to visit a friend ,  and you need to know if she is sincere to you ,  then you stop in front of her house and call her
aha
to ask her if she is home ,  if she tells you she is not then you know she is lying to you ,  because you know she is home
oh ,  that has never happened to me ,  but it is true
Because I did that to a friend of mine once
hmm
I called and I said  from my house I called him and I said ,  Where are you ?   In my house but I'm going to go out
aha
and I was in ,  and so I said to my other friend I called her a ,  to go and see if she's lying about what she's saying ,  and we went in front of her house
aha
and we parked and we called her another time and we said ,  Where are you ?   And she said ,  I went out to a party
aha
and I told her ,  you went out really quickly ,  not even five minutes ago I called you from my house and now I'm calling you from my cell phone and she said ,  yes well they went back to get ,  because she lives alone now
hmm
and yes when they took the light and they turned it on and off
ah
and I said ,  she's in her house ,  to me ,  she's in her house
ah aha
and where I live in front there came ,  it seemed like the ,  the landlord ,  it seemed like he had a girlfriend or something
aha
and he was being unfaithful to his woman
aha
and the boy ca  it seemed that she ,  he put a ,  his wife seemed to have gotten a private investigator or something
aha
and was able to film him with the cell phone the ,  the camera
to you
he started to film the house and the man when he would come out and go in
oh God
and when I saw that the cellulars are good for everything
aha Well what a thing what can be done with cellulars now right
for ,  for everything ,  for everything ,  for everything ,  for everything even to send messages
aha
and ,  and ,  ah ,  they're an advantage ,  they're an advantage because for an ,  for an emergency that you have
yes
and they're a disadvantage ,  for that same reason because when you are on the cellular in the traffic
aha
and you are not paying attention you're in the car ,  you turn right turn left without realizing that
aha
without putting the turn signals or anything
aha
and that's a danger
yes it's a big danger . 
because because is a danger for you and for the other people that are in the other cars
yes ,  I'm
but the people don't respect ,  the laws they have enacted ,  here in Illinois they enacted them it started July fourth
aha
but they keep on doing it
oh ,  I think that they haven' approved that law here yet ,  I only remember one time when
mhm
they had something about us not driving while using the cellphone
aha ,  aha
and if they'd catch you doing it ,  they would give you a fine of around three hundred dollars
aha ,  ha ,  ha ,  ha
but ,  that's the only one I've heard about ,  so ,  I don't know if it's illegal here or not . 
aha ,  aha
but ,  I don't know how they do it because I find it really difficult to drive and talk on the phone at the same time ,  but
because ,  we are supposed to keep our hands in the wheel in the event of any emergency . 
mhm mhm
but ,  with the cellphone ,  if you have the cellphone in your hand ,  and the ,  guide ,  in the other hand
aha
it's going to be really hard for you to turn right or turn left
aha
but ,  people just do it like ,  like if was some kind of game . 
oh aha
that's why they put that law in place ,  all the stores tried to get people to but that little thing that you put into your ear
oh yes
so that you can ,  so that you can use the telephone . 
oh aha
but I don't know ,  I don't know ,  the police are also putting a bad example because you see the police with the phone in their hand and the detective well
it's like that
if they do it you'll do it too
aha
because it's for everyone ,  the law is for everyone
aha
including the police chief and including ourselves
it's true
my brother tells me a ,  that I should buy a cell phone ,  because I don't have a cell phone ,  but he said buy a cell phone so I can reach you wherever you are . 
aha aha
because he calls me a lot at home
aha
and I'm never there
oh aha
and he tells me ,  buy yourself a cell phone and if you're ,  for example ,  shopping or if you're at the beach or wherever you are
aha
and I can reach you
aha
the cell phone is also good because when you go shopping and you have someone at home you can call and ask ,  what do you need ? 
Or what don't we need ? 
aha ,  I like this too since I have kids
aha
I like it when they stay at home they can call me
ah ,  aha ,  aha
or I can call the house ,  many times I've thought of
aha ,  aha
disconnecting the telephone in the house
aha
because well I have a cell phone ,  and I can take this telephone with me where
aha aha
wherever ,  but at the same time I think that the kids are at home ,  well ,  I need to have a telephone at home
aha ,  aha ,  aha
But you know sometimes ,  with the long distance the cell phones are more expensive than
aha aha
than the telephone at home
and the telephone at home aha aha aha
hmm yes this
I ,  no ,  I ,  no ,  I don't remove the telephone from the house because since I have Internet . 
oh aha
that's why I have it
I also think this because ah ,  I have an antenna ,  I don't have cable
aha
and with the ,  the cable company you can also have Internet
aha ,  aha ,  aha
but I can pay both ,  so I want
oh ,  because I can't get rid of it either ,  because I have a year long contract . 
with the oh ,  aha
well I ,  I can't get rid of it .   But ah ,  but if God wants ,  the day that I take the telephone out of my house
yes hmm
I can ,  get ,  get a cell phone
oh aha
but since my kids are big
aha
and each one has a cell phone I don't have a problem . 
oh yeah
but it's good for ,  for example ,  you're in a restaurant buying food and you're reading the menu ,  what they want and what they don't want
aha
that's also another point in favor of cellphones . 
that's right
and ,  and ,  specially in an emergency ,  in an emergency when you are driving
aha
oh ,  oh ,  if you have an accident ,  you can call the cops with your cellphone or call an agency ,  vehicle agency ,  or your insurance company ,  or anyone else
aha ,  I haven't been though that ,  I was about forty  minutes away from my house
aha
and my car broke down
aha
and I had a cellphone with me and I was able to call a tow truck
aha ,  ha
that came to pick up the car and I also called someone to
aha
pick me up
aha ,  aha ,  aha
so ,  it was pretty useful . 
no ,  and ,  and also ,  cellphones are good because if you see any dangerous things going on in the street
aha
you can also notify
that's right
when an example that they are stealing from someone or that they are am am ,  am ,  killing someone the cell phone is good because of that . 
aha
also and it's bad also because sometimes you get out of some zone
aha
and it doesn't have a signal
oh I know
and it has ,  you have to keep on looking where you have the signal
mhm
that's the bad thing as well
that's right ,  and sometimes ,  like here
mhm
ah ,  you're talking on the phone and another company picks up the signal
aha
and it costs you roaming charges
aha oh ,  yes
and aha
oh , 
That happens sometimes here ,  as it's smaller ,  with fewer people
aha
as companies fight for the cell phones
ah aha
so then one has a ,  a satellite there and another one there
aha oh
and then sometimes they cross
aha ,  aha
and you get a signal from the other company and they charge you roaming charges
wow you have to be arguing with them
yes aha
ah ,  when you see the bill and you don't recognize that call
once it came out to seven hundred dollars because of that
wow
it was a phone from Sprint
ah aha
and um an antenna from  AT&T caught it
aha
so then they charged me roaming charges
aha
but since I had just recently gotten that phone
aha
and I didn't know that could happen ,  I thought that in the city I was in supposedly it wasn't roaming
aha
so they lowered my bill by half and I had to pay half
wow my goodness
but I already disconnected this telephone and I didn't go back to this company
aha oh
but this seemed really ugly to me
that ,  that you weren't ready to pay the seven hundred dollars . 
eys
ah ,  wow ,  and you didn't realize it also
yes
because some people don't realize and pay the bills and don't even realize that they're being charged something ,  being charged for another thing . 
hmm ,  hmm ,  yes
wow ,  but
But any way ,  half of seven hundred dollars was a lot they charged me me
three hundred and fifty ,  they charged you a lot . 
yes
uh ,  wow ,  but if you don't talk ,  you have to pay seven hundred dollars ,  no . 
yes ,  aha
if you don't realize
yes
that's why it's wise ,  if you have a cellular ,  to pay attention on the calls you make and receive ,  because there are some cellulars
oh
that
hello ? 
Hello ? 
yes ,  Who's speaking ? 
Is ,  eh ,  is Brenda from ,  eh ,  Virginia ,  in the United States . 
Ah ,  nice to meet you ,  Brenda .  My name is Mercedes ,  and I'm speaking from Philadelphia . 
Ah ,  okay . 
A 
Okay ,  well ,  the topic of the day ,  is the cellular phone . 
yes . 
Well ,  that's something .  I don't know how it is that people ,  lately ,  all of them have cellulars .  And ,  and act like ,  well ,  that ,  that
What did they do before the cellular phones ? 
yes . 
Because ,  now ,  each time one goes by the streets ,  everybody is talking on the phone . 
Mm .  mm . 
But ,  besides that ,  is that they are ,  speaking in a loud voice .  And then ,  they are talking about ,  about ,  their personal life ,  and everybody hears it ,  and , 
you know ,  then a , 
yes ,  yes . 
one looks at them ,  they look at you bad like ,  what are you listening to ?  And ,  no ,  but ,  they ,  who are speaking ,  in a loud voice ,  are saying , 
is their life . 
yes ,  it's true . 
Then ,  sometimes ,  once ,  I was in the restaurant ,  and someone ,  and this was like four years ago ,  and the phone rang . 
Then ,  he answered ,  but instead of lowering the volume ,  or or putting it on vibrate ,  well ,  eh the phone kept ringing .  And ,  I think that he got like
two calls after the first .  You know ,  that is already ,  too much . 
yes . 
Because ,  when one goes to ,  the restaurants to eat ,  one is there you know ,  to have fun ,  relax ,  you know . 
Mm . 
And someone is there with the phone all the time .  And then ,  talking in a loud voice .  Eh ,  the same as with the movies ,  in the movie theater ,  a lot of people are already used to turning off the phones . 
But ,  a few times ,  it seems like someone forgets to and ,  and one hears ,  a phone ring . 
yes ,  yes ,  I agree .  Em ,  it seems to me ,  perhaps ,  yes ,  that of the worst places ,  it would be ,  in the movie theater when one goes to see a movie and that one
Mm
wants to pay attention to the movie .  Because ,  one ,  is not as if the movie is cheap ,  they are usually very expensive ,  and , 
Mm . 
for someone to come and take the Right ? 
Mm . 
Eh ,  the concentration .  And ,  also the restaurants ,  definitely ,  it seems to me also ,  yes ,  a lack of respect . 
Yeah
yes . 
And ,  now ,  in well ,  just today ,  eh ,  I came from the mall .  And ,  every so often ,  the kids with the cellulars ,  going like , 
like it was necessary ,  for them to be talking ,  well ,  eh ,  one doesn't know what they are talking about .  But ,  if it was important , 
they wouldn't be in the mall . 
Mhm
And ,  you know ,  sometimes you don't need a telephone .  Let's imagine you are in the car ,  and ,  and
the car just stops in the middle of the road .  Then you need to call some emergency service .  And ,  and ,  well ,  this has happened to me .  I didn't have a cell phone ,  and I had to walk
yes
No ,  I couldn't call ,  I had to wait for somebody to pass by ,  to help me change the tire
Mhm ,  mhm .  And ,  for instance ,  what do you think about ?  the other question is .  let's say ,  people that drives while
oh
on the cell phone .  I think that ,  not long ago ,  here ,  I heard that New Jersey has been one of the first States to ban that
of holding a cell phone at the same time you are driving
Mhm
But ,  yes ,  I  think that meybe using headphones
Mhm
is decreasing that a little .  But ,  no ,  no ,  most people use it . 
Mhm .  Even before New York imposed that regulation ,  I always used that ,  that thing for the ear
Mhm
And I always used it because ,  you know ,  why would I be driving and then have a ,  a ,  this ,  with the telephone ,  and you can't
So ,  well ,  I always used it .  But I can't understand why other people don't use it .  And you can see them
one hand in the ear ,  and the other in the steering wheel . 
yes ,  but ,  and another thing I think is ,  eh ,  as I told you ,  I've heard that New Jersey is one of the first States ,  I think New York State also , 
Mhm
But ,  like there has been a bit of slowness ,  on ,  on behalf of the other states ,  to implement laws
Uh um
¿Right ?  ,  for
Right ,  because here there isn't
yes ,  here ,  i think neither in Pennsylvania ,  no ,  there's none of that
There isn't any ,  and ,  and I'm waiting for them to put it .  Because ,  uh ,  here ,  i was raised in New York ,  and when i moved here ,  hail Mary ,  the accidents that happen in the highways
that's ,  there's an accident every day
And
And i don't know if it's because ,  because ,  uh ,  but that maybe it could be ,  well ,  they're talking on the phone and they don't realize
what ,  what they're doing
yes ,  and sometimes ,  there are people that ,  on top of talking over the phone ,  they're also eating
Uh right
I mean ,  that ,  uh ,  worse ,  uh ,  the problem is
Uh huh ,  yeah ,  i ne  ,  i never ,  you know ,  i am always
Yeah
uh ,  well ,  yes ,  if i have the ,  the cellphone ,  i have the earpiece ,  and i expe  ,  you know ,  i eat when i have to eat ,  and and i drive when
i have to drive .  Not ,  not both at the same time .  And afterwords ,  if the person crashes ,  ¿what ,  what are they going to do ?  ,  ¿you know ?  ,  they don't ,  they don't think
The other thing that i ,  well ,  what i said ,  but there's always a benefit in having ,  having a cellphone .  Although ,  as you say ,  right ?  ,  uh
Uh huh
what would you do ,  what did we do before that we can't almost live ,  without the cellphone ,  ¿right ? 
Mm . 
But ,  it's also a convenience having them because , 
yes . 
let's say ,  like that ,  in situations like the one you went through ,  that something happened to the car and you had to , 
Aha . 
for being without ,  without the cellular ,  right ? 
Aha . 
had problems . 
yes . 
I mean ,  and that ,  that ,  for me ,  is a ,  is an advantage to have ,  so , 
yes . 
yes ,  is good for emergencies .  But ,  people abuse it ,  is not
Ah ,  yes ,  yeah
only for emergencies ,  but in any situation ,  so . 
yes ,  now they are ,  that ,  that the kids have abused it too much . 
Mm . 
Then ,  before it was with the pagers ,  now is more with the phones . 
yes
But ,  ah ,  and  ,  then ,  now is with the ,  with the ,  How do you say it ?  the ,  the ,  features that the phones have ,  that they have some cameras ,  and they have music ,  and they have
Aha . 
how many things ,  have the phones nowadays .  And , they were using the ,  the telephone cameras to look under the skirts ,  or they were doing something like that .  and ,  Ave Maria . 
yes ,  Yes ,  yes ,  that is true . 
Is that ,  from everything that is created ,  then ,  they can use it as a good thing ,  and they give a bad use to it . 
yes ,  that too ,  I have heard it too .  From the telephones .  But ,  there are too ,  a ,  eh ,  eh ,  more modern ,  eh ,  lets say ,  eh features ,  I don´t know how to say it in ,  eh
Hmm . 
from the cell phone ,  that are more modern , 
Hmm . 
eh ,  features .  Lets say ,  as an example ,  I have hear that there are cell phones that you can pay ,  eh ,  they have the information of the credit card inside the cell phone
Hmm . 
Then ,  you can use it too ,  to pay .  Eh ,  you don´t need anymore the wallet ,  and anything else ,  but with the cell phone .  The problem could be that if you loose the phone . 
Hmm .  Yeah ,  in Japan ,  I think I heard something like that .  But I have not read anything ,  or seen anything in detail ,  about that . 
Hmm . 
But ,  I have heard something like that . 
yes . 
from ,  from the telephone ,  now they have many things ,  and something about the credit cards . 
Hmm ,  hmm . 
but ,  there in Japan ,  they are more advanced than ,  than here .  They have the phones ,  I think they have something like a kind of watch .  Like the cell phone in the watch ,  or something like that . 
Ah . 
yes , 
Ah . 
but ,  since over there is so advanced ,  and here they still don't have that technique . 
I ,  that's another thing that I find interesting .  Why ,  do we think ,  eh ,  that this country is very advanced ,  with the ,  advanced with the technology And ,  really that
in ,  let's say in things like cellulars ,  because ,  for example ,  I know that the cellular ,  is ,  eh ,  let's say ,  the Nokia company ,  which is Norwegian ,  I think it is . 
MM . 
They are the ones that have started to come out ,  let's say with ,  much more advanced technology of the , 
Mm . 
having the ,  the credit card ,  credit card information .  And ,  that still hasn't come to us . 
Mm .  That ,  that ,  we have to see .  Because , 
Mm . 
that can be eh ,  How is it ?  dangerous . 
Mm . 
Because ,  they can take one's cellular ,  and ,  get one's numbers , 
yes ,  yes
Or ,  use the phone to ,  to make purchases ,  or there has to be ,  this ,  maybe they haven't come out with it yet because they are looking to see how they can do it so that
those things can't be done
Mm ,  mm
But ,  as soon as they come out with something good ,  like I said ,  they always think of a way to you use it for no good . 
Always like abusing . 
Aha . 
Right ?  the technology . 
Yeah
So ,  do you think there should be a rule ,  or maybe ,  a state wide regulation ,  a law for all the States ,  in which talking on the cellphone should be banned or that you are required to use an earphone ? 
Mhm ,  yea ,  that's it ,  you know ,  in the beginning ,  one was ,  you know ,  kind of ,  you never saw anyone talking on the phone
and you know ,  it was like ,  oh ,  well ,  you know ,  he has to talk ,  he has an emergency or something ,  but now ,  you know it's just chatting
Mhm . 
You know ,  particularly young people ,  they sometimes ,  they speak on the phone to talk about ,  oh I have the
cellphone ,  my cellphone ,  mine ,  mine ,  mine shines ,  mine is pink ,  mine does this and that ,  you know . 
yes ,  ye 
Hello ? 
Yes ,  good evening . 
Hello ,  good evening . 
How are you ? 
Very good ,  very good .  And what's your name ?  Norma ?  My name is Miguel Angel . 
Norma .  Ah ,  okay . 
Nice to meet you . 
Same here . 
Well Norma ,  where do you live ,  where are you at ? 
Ah ,  I'm ,  I live here in Atlanta ,  Georgia . 
Ah ,  in Atlanta ,  how nice .  I'm in Philadelphia . 
Mm .  Ah ,  okay . 
Aha ,  And ,  where are you from ? 
Peruvian . 
Ah ,  from Peru ?  Aha ,  aha . 
Mm ,  aha . 
Very good ,  I'm from Spain . 
Ah ,  okay . 
yes Well nothing Norma ,  we have to talk about cellular phones ,  right ? 
Mm . 
Well so
And ,  and what do you  think ? 
I love it ,  I love to talk on the phone that's why I signed up for this study No ,  I'm totally addicted ,  I'm totally addicted to the mobile . 
I ,  eh ,  well ,  I ,  I call it mobile ,  in ,  in Spain we call it mobile instead of cellular . 
Ah ,  really ?  Mm .  yes . 
But well ,  eh ,  yes the mobile .  Well I'm not totally hooked Look ,  I've been living a year in the United States
Mm . 
and when I arrived the first thing I did was buy a cellular
And well ,  really ,  it's necessary nowadays ,  right ?  Having a cellular is necessary and although it can ,  sometimes ,  in
yes . 
cost a lot well ,  is not
It's very expensive ,  is true ,  is true ,  it's very expensive . 
Mm ,  yes ,  but it's practical ,  right ?  Because ,  for example ,  you find yourself in an emergency and you don't have ,  there's no phone
But Of course . 
at least the cellular is there . 
yes ,  no ,  no ,  is true ,  is true ,  in a way ,  look ,  also
Ah . 
you know what happens ?  that those things create the necessity ,  because when mobile phones didn't exist
Mm . 
nobody had the need for them ,  You know ? 
Uh um .  Oh ,  yeah ,  that's also true ,  ¿right ? 
But now it seems like it isn't ,  that we all need it ,  i mean ,  that
Uh um
It's a ,  i know ,  i recognize it's a useless need ,  ¿you know ? 
Yeah ,  it's a ciu  ,  uh ,  and that ,  it's that we live in a consumer society ,  ¿right ?  ,  so
Indeed ,  indeed
all the people is influenced by the advertisements ,  uh ,  it's influenced because other people have
That's it ,  that's it
¿Right ?  ,  and it's real  ,  really
And bec  ,  and ,  it gets to a po  ,  sure
Right
There is a moment in which things that aren't really necessary seem to be like that
Yeah ,  right ,  that's true ,  yeah ,  it's very true
Yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah
No ,  because before ,  like you say ,  before we didn't have ,  ¿right ?  ,  the cellphone ,  or
Uh
Or even when there was no computer
Indeed ,  indeed
¿Right ?  ,  so uh ,  no ,  we lived without computers
Sure
they're ,  it's just that ,  they're necessary for living ,  right ? 
And when they don't ,  when there didn't use to be any internet when there didn't used to be any internet
Right . 
well it seems ,  and well nothing happened ,  and now you say ,  oh my gosh ,  how can I survive without the internet ? 
yea ,  yea ,  it's true ,  really ,  no he's like
You know ? 
really ,  the ,  how it influences peoples mentality ,  the mentality of the ,  of the
yes ,  yea . 
society ,  right ?  the
Mm . 
the ,  uh ,  the products all the
yes ,  yes ,  yes .  I remember when all this internet stuff started ,  and email and all that
commercials and everything .  Mm hmm . 
it was ,  it was a wonder ,  and now we can't live without them . 
Mm ,  yea it's true
Now all day ,  well I look at my email ,  I go to check my email to see if
Ah . 
to see if Fulanito ,  Melanito have answered me ,  you know ?  You're always wondering about your email . 
Ah . 
And ,  and ,  uh ,  before you didn't notice it wasn't there ,  before ,  you know ? 
Well yes ,  really
But well ,  my
Life used to be simpler ,  eh ,  I guess
yes ,  that's right ,  that's right we are not doing anything else than making our own lives harder
yes ,  eh ,  or ,  I mean ,  it has its advantages and disadvantages ,  right ? 
Mm ,  mm
Really
yes ,  of course ,  sure . 
yes . 
No ,  the thing about the cellular phones ,  it has also solved many problems
Aha . 
above all ,  people that live in far away towns
Mhm
you know ,  they don't have any other communication means ,  or
Mhm . 
where they don't have landlines
yes ,  that's true
you know ?  or ,  for example ,  during emergencies . 
Mhm . 
that when you are driving in the freeway and you have a problem with your car or
Mhm . 
Is there ,  is there an accident or anything and then you can tell ,  do you know ?  This is ,  mmm ,  it is
Yes ,  this one ,  this one yes ,  this is very clear ,  in reality no  ?  yes
This ,  yes ,  what happened was clear .  How many times ,  realistically ,  you're missing the phone for emergencies  ?  Not many . 
Mm ,  aha . 
Almost always used . 
Many times too ,  many times too right  ?  When the people are very distracted talking at the phone ,  or at the cell ,  how do you call it ,  many times
Yes yes
accidents happen no  ?  Because the people that care more ,  they get more excited at the phone ,  about news or who they're talking to and whatnot
In fact ,  a lot
And they can cause accidents too ,  no  ? 
Clearly ,  many people ,  for example ,  use it while driving . 
Mhm ,  it's one of the disadvantages .  Mhm . 
Yes ,  this is not permitted but many people do it . 
Yes ,  yes I saw ,  no  ?  It's true ,  many people are here at the phone and driving ,  no  ? 
Of course ,  here in Philadelphia ,  for example ,  all the taxi drivers . 
Mhm
All the taxi drivers talk through ,  at the cell and driving .  But all ,  there is an exception . 
Clearly . 
Mm ,  he is
To the .  .  .  yeah ,  well ,  now ,  ¿right ?  ,  we're ,  like i told you ,  a city of consumption in everything
True
it has so much influence in people's mentality that in the end you end up thinking that you really need it
It's true ,  and ,  and it's the same ,  ¿is it the same in Peru too ?  ,  the ,  the cellphones ,  everyone's got the fever
I guess so ,  i live ,  and when i came here to America ,  ten years ago ,  i haven't gone back so i guess it must be in it's climax
¿Have you been in the United States for ten years without going back to Peru ? 
No ,  yeah ,  without going back ,  yeah
But ,  ok ,  ¿and why is that ? 
Well ,  the thing is that ,  uh ,  i got married here and there is no

So ,  I think that she's in the hospital and ,  and they don't think that she'll come out .

Of course ,  always ,  one has that attachment ,  right ? 
Is always sad . 
to the ,  to the family ,  one is attached to the family . 
Sure ,  and you remember all the good moments . 
Family relationships ,  and one always ,  always feels ,  right ?

pain .  Mm . 
well ,  you know ,  to to the country ,  we would go

and well ,  he would make jokes ,  and play with me and
Aha . 
because they were ,  my grandparents on my mother's side have always been very close .  You know ?

We've always had them really close to us ,  with us ,  and ,  you know ?  So then ,  well is a stronger relationship .  But well ,  look ,  I don't know ,  that's how things are .  You know ? 
Well ,  that happens ,  well no ,  this world nothing is forever in this material world ,  right ?  there are always temporary things
Exactly ,  exactly . 
No ,  and
Eh ,  yes ,  the poor people

besides that ,  they never made any changes ,  talking about the cellphone ,  because of course
Sure .

Ah ,  it's ,  of course ,  everything has changes .  Mhm . 
in Spain ,  television didn't exist when they were born ,  you know ? 
Mm .  I see ,  yes ,  I can imagine it . 
because my ,  sure ,  my grandfather was born in nineteen fourteen ,  I mean
Ah . 
of course there wasn't any ,  there was nothing . 
Well
and look at all the changes that have  happened during his lifetime ,   you know ?  the ,  the ,  eh ,  they've experienced so many changes during their lives . 
Sure ,  now ,  imagine this ,  it's really
The television . 
they'd let me ,  many people ,  no ?  that are ,  eh ,  that are older think that the life they had before was better than this one
That's right ,  well look ,  no ?  they went from not having a television ,  yes ,  because it didn't exist ,  no television ,  no phones ,  well phones
Aha .  Sure . 
there might have been phones already but very few ,  you know ? 
Mhm . 
and they went from t hat ,  to television ,  fax ,  Internet ,  well they never really got a chance to use the Internet ,  sure . 
Mhm .  Mhm . 
Never ,  never ,  never got to the computers subject ,  but ,  but i imagine that it would be a spectacular change for them
Sure ,  that's ,  really ,  and that's why the ,  life gets more complicated ,  many times
Sure ,  i mean ,  for us it's a change ,  i
Right
Well ,  that's what i remember ,  when the first computers started and
Uh um
And well ,  i mean ,  because i am thirty years old ,  ¿you know ?  ,  but
Oh
But well ,  yeah ,  i have lived without computers and now

Oh ,  that's sweet ,  that's sweet .  That's good ,  that's good ,  it's ,  and you must be very happy
Well ,  yeah ,  happy about the kids ,  because it's also a job with ,  full time ,  like they say
Oh ,  of course ,  of course ,  ¿do you work outside home too ? 
No ,  there's always ,  no ,  no ,  i am ,  my husband works ,  i am with them at home
You take care ,  i mean ,  you take care of the kids full time ,  full time
Take care of the kids ,  yeah ,  right
Yes ,  no ,  no ,  that's ,  that's more ,  that's harder than a job outside the house eh
Ah ,  yes ,  is hard ,  right ?  because one is the whole time with the kids . 
Hi ,  yes good evening ,  who am I talking to ? 
Hello ,  my name is Gloria and I live in New York
oh ,  pleased to meet you Gloria ,  my name is Silvia ,  and I live in Philadelphia
oh ,  my pleasure .  ok ,  we must talk about cell phones
yes ,  cell phones ,  yes ,  really ? 
I ,  I hate cell phones ,  I mean ,  it may be convenient in an emergency ,  you know ,  if you get stuck somewhere ,  or mmm ,  that would be the only use ,  I don't use it ,  I don't use it
aha
I don't like it ,  I don't like it ,  I think people gets distracted I don't like ,  they us  they try to use it in the school ,  I mean
I think that ,  the ,  and ,  and they drive while talking on the telephone ,  I think you can't do both things at the same time
oh ,  I agree ,  absolutely
aha
yes ,  look ,  there statistics about all the dead on the road
yes
of people who was talking while driving
yes  , yes ,  yes ,  today for instance ,  I was going to the ,  I dress as a clown ,  and I was going somewhere ,  and the girl ,  I was ,  I was alright
and first she told me 'come at three o'clock' ,  but then she called me and told me to go at four ,  and I told her ,  'you know what ?  I will come at five o'clock ,  and if you call again I won't come at all'
yes
so ,  I was one block away from her house and she called and told me ,  'no ,  you are in the wrong saide ,  it's to the other side' I turned around
and she called again ,  and I thought 'I won't answer the telephone' I'll manage to get there without talking to her again
oh ,  really ,  yes yes
and I achieved it ,  because she called me ,  let me tell you ,  like eight times in less than fift  five minutes
oh ,  but that lady is not right ,  oh my God
I know ,  I know ,  and she even made demands ,  I think that she ,  she thinks she is paying me a fortune
psss
demand ,  but she told me ,  we enjoyed a lot ,  you know ,  but those kids were very demanding ,  oh my God I left ,  I was cont  ,  and I even stayed longer than I had to
because whenever I start something I like to finish it ,  you know ,  and afterwards all of them ,  all of them decided they wanted candy ,  and I said no ,  I only
will make candy for fifteen people , 
oh ,  aha ,  aha ,  really
because otherwise they would still keep me there ,  I would still be there ,  yes ,  yes ,  but they enjoyed ,  but I said ,  I didn't even get a tip ,  I said no ,  no ,  I won't do this ,  no
oh ,  no
you know ,  there are some districts where people don't tip
which ones ?  oh ,  aha ,  aha ,  absolutely
like ,  where the rich people is ,  yes ,  it's not necessarily poor people ,  I mean ,  it was a very beautiful house in Roosevelt which is supposed to be a bad district ,  but in that district ,  houses
very beautiful ,  I was astonished ,  I said here I
I don't know that district ,  Roosevelt ?  oh ,  no ,  I don't know Long Island
yes ,  in Long Island ,  oh ,  you don't know Long Island ?  Where in Pennsylvania do you live in ? 
e eh a little bit north of the city
oh ,  ok ,  and you are Puerto Rican ,  aren't you ? 
no ,  I'm Cuban ,  yes ,  so you are Puerto Rican ?  oh that's cool ,  mhm
oh ,  Cuban ,  oh yes I am Puerto Rican yes ,  lately I'm talking to another lady ,  I think she is named Norma and she lives in South Carolina
that's so weird ,  ah ,  wow
and I got her three times ,  by chance ,  I thought that you were going to be her ,  that's why I asked you your name
yes ,  that's weird ,  eh ,  you see ,  I have a son that is also taking part of this
yes ,  oh ,  you do ? 
and ,  and ,  I'm hoping that one day we will be able to talk together
aha ,  but ,  but ,  the other day I was match to a man three times ,  also ,  when we spoke Spanish ,  I got the same man and I thought it was because it was late at night ,  I take calls late at night
aha
and I think him and I were the only ones available to talk at night
ah ,  that happened in last year's study ? 
you know ,  yes
because ,  because I know that they did one last year too
aha
yes ,  my son took part on it last year
yes ,  yes ,  me too ,  you could use your cellphone ,  or even five ,  I used five or six cellphones ,  the more cellphones you used ,  the more different numbers you used ,  the more money you got
really ?  I think I remember now ,  but ,  you are not doing it now are you ? 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  no ,  no ,  they don't let you do that now
no ,  you shouldn't
but something is better than nothing ,  so
yes ,  sure ,   yes
you know ,  you are home and ,  what do you do during the day ,  do you have a job ? 
yes I'm a painter ,  yes ,  I'm ,  I'm a portraitist
oh ,  yeah ?   Oh ,  oh ,  okay ,  oh ,  house painter ? 
sorry ?   portraitist ,  portraitist
house painter ?  no what ,  what's a portraitist ,  oh portrait ,  okay ,  okay ,  I see .   Oh ,  oh ,  that's nice ,  yeah
yes thanks ,  and and so ,  u  the cell phone ,  Do you usually charge it or almost never charge it ? 
I charge it ,  but you know I always forget
hmm
my husband always tells me ,  I don't know why I bought you the cell phone ,  I'm always charging it ,  like ,  I have the battery and after I wait
ah yes ,  yes ,  this happens to me that ,  either I forget to charge it ,  or I forget to take it after I charged it
ahh yeah ,  this happens to me too ,  aha
yes ,  I do this a lot
I ,  I charge it more for work ,  but well if my kid needs me ,  it's also useful ,  but he knows that I don't like to drive and
yes ,  yes
if I'm driving I tell him ,  if I don't answer you it's because I'm driving and I know ,  I park ,  if I see that ,  in a place and I call him
yes ,  aha ,  aha
because I know ,  not putting this thing in my ear ,  I don't think that I could do two things at the same time ,  I see my friends and I tell them ,  no ,  don't drive and
and talk ,  please ,  please ,  when I go with them ,  don't talk ,  don't talk ,  please , 
me too ,  yes ,  yes
yes because a lot of times and ,  we have accidents because of little things ,  this is why I tell her ,  this and after talking on the telephone and after ,  you can't do
yes
it cannot be done ,  and afterwords ,  people talk in the theater ,  at school ,  at school we have to take their cellphones ,  because if we don't
they ,  they have them in class ,  i work at a high school and ,  and
Uh um ,  yeah
every day they lose them ,  every day we pick up a bunch of
Aw ,  but that's how boys are ,  they're very irresponsible ,  how can you trust them with cellphones if
cellphones if ,  if ,  if ,  if my baby leaves it here and we told him that if he uses it it has to be to call me ,  if he messes up a place
or he leaves it ,  and that's how he uses it ,  yeah
Yeah ,  like that ,  yeah ,  that's why you are ,  a big relief ,  that you ,  you can locate your children
Yeah ,  yes ,  yes ,  that's the only good  ,  that ,  in that way it's good ,  i mean ,  that you
Yeah ,  it's that ,  it's that ,  it's a thing to use for important things ,  ant the problem is that people trivializes it
Right
And uses it for things of ,  foolish
Yeah ,  exactly ,  like once ,  my friend's husband called because i do too ,  and he called her and he was fighting with her on the phone
And i told her hang up because since she was going to be leading and fighting at the same time
Oh no ,  yeah ,  yeah
arguing ,  i say ,  hook him ,  tell him that ,  that there was a cop that you had to hang him up ,  and she did
you can't say that ,  ¿right ?  ,  oh ,  there is a cop coming ,  i better hang up ,  yeah
Yeah ,  yeah ,  and ,  and he was furious when we got there ,  ¿why did you hang up on me ?  ,  and she said "because there was a cop" ,  and she said "¿isn't it true ? " ,  and i said yeah
a cop ,  and they give her a ticket ¿right ?  ,  and she uses that ear thing ,  he says ,  but she had that ear thing ,  she couldn't hear you
Oh ,  that's so funny ,  um
no ,  I said no way ,  and she said ,  he is fighting because I didn't do the meal and I told her ,  tell him you are working
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes how funny ,  yes
yes ,  but he calls her very ,  very ,  very ,  very often ,  because she is a reader ,  so he leaves her with the children and is always
mm ,  mm
at what timw will you come back ?  when will you come back ?  when eh ?  and my ,  my ,  my partner as a clown also talks a lot ,  a lot on the phone
all the time
mm ,  ah
and she doesn't have the earphone ,  she picks it up ,  and I tell her ,  you know you are acting bad driving and talking at the same time
one of these days you'll have an accident and ,  I hope not ,  you will hit one of these kids
yes ,  yes ,  that's true ,  that's absolutely irresponsible
mhm ,  yes ,  mhm
yes ,  and ,  how interesting your work as a clown
yes ,  I work as a clown ,  I ,  today I was dressed as Dora
oh ,  aha ,  aha
Dora the explorer ,  yes ,  so I was speaking both Spanish and English ,  and teaching the colors to kids ,  and I ain't no young girl ,  I am a grandma already

Oh ,  here is raining the previous storm is passing . 
Aha . 
Ah ,  Ophelia eh ,  the storm that just recently came by and so is passing ,  but there's a lot of rain ,  a lot of thunder . 
Aha . 
a lot of rain ,  excuse me ,  not as much as it is over there ,  more or less . 
Aha . 
A ,  so then everything is down there
Well ,  good ,  it hasn't gotten here ,  well ,  we haven't gotten bad weather nor ,  nor a consequence from the
No . 
eh the hurricanes and the storms
yes ,  oh all those people that
there has been a lot of movement ,  is that many of the eh ,  victims from Louisiana
yes . 
have come over here to San Antonio
yes . 
and so there have been many well many changes ,  a lot of movements ,  eh ,   a lot of environmental activity . 
Ah ,  yes ,  but is it getting worse or is it getting more or less ? 
Well ,  eh ,  good because ,  ah ,  ah ,  because there still are a lot of resources and a lot of space here
Ah ,  really ? 
but there were some fights ,  especially with teenagers
yes . 
recently arrived to the high schools here
Ah . 
eh ,  that they already had their good fights the ones from Louisiana with
yes ,  I know ,  but yes ,  the people from Texas but there are a lot of Hispanics down there ,  right ? 
yes ,  there are a lot ,  there are a lot of Hispanics ,  mm . 
And the people that are arriving are not
And well ,  the ones from Louisiana are ,  um
they are black ,  right ? 
aha ,  and violent ,  so
yes . 
no ,  with gang members and those things ,  then well ,  so ,  let's see how eh ,  also the American football team arrived ,  they are going to be training here
Really ? 
they are going to be playing here in the Astrodome
Oh ,  okay . 
so ,  well ,  I say ,  is ,  is interesting it's known  also of two or three chefs from Louisiana who have already opened up restaurants here and ,  and well ,  well those are changes
and let's see how it works out . 
yes ,  because how one ,  one felt like before it was different ,  right ?  Now it's going to be ,  it starts changing for the good
yes . 
Mm ,  how do you feel about that ?  No ,  you don't know ? 
And ,  And ,  and ,  where  ,  where are you from ? 
You know Connecticut ,  because I came from ,  from New York . 
And why do you speak Spanish ? 
Because my first wife was Colombian
Ah . 
and ,  ah ,  and by force ,  I had to learn the ,  the language
Okay . 
That her parents didn't speak didn't speak any English . 
Aha . 
So then to understand the in laws ,  my parents are Puerto Rican
Aha . 
but I was born here ,  here in the ,  the city of New York . 
Ah ,  but you speak Spanish very well ,  how long did you have to study it ? 
Well I never studied it because my mom always spoke Spanish at home
Ah ,  perfect . 
but she spoke ,  she is Puerto Rican
Okay ,  then ,  then ,  that's why
my mom is Puerto Rican
perfect ,  perfect . 
but ,  but the Puerto Ricans don't speak Spanish well they speak it all you know ,  broken up ,  with bad words I mean ,  not with bad words ,  I'm saying ,  but ,  the words they say are not
correct in the ,  in the ,  the Spanish language they say car ,  they don't pronounce the ,  the  R and the
Ah ,  okay ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes I already understand it . 
So ,  then Spanish is not a refined Spanish . 
Aha . 
But little by little you know ,  with the people and ,  and here in New York there are a lot of Hispanics ,  there are a lot of Puerto Rican and a lot of you know ,  Latins ,  more or less
yes ,  really ? 
so then one has to learn different eh dialects they call it in English
Sure ,  sure ,  to be able to understand each other
Ah ,  all ,  yes ,  but
and there are many ,  are many variations
Yes ,  of course . 
there are many variations ,  well ,  and all this ,  you
But here
do use a cellular phone ? 
yes ,  I'm ,  it's just one ,  the only phone I use . 
Ah ,  really ? 
yes ,  is like the ,  I have a Nextel and Nextel the ,  incoming calls are free
Aha . 
so I don't use the house phone because no ,  no ,  I never used the house phone ,  everybody called me on the cellular . 
Aha . 
Then I took out took out the house phone . 
Ah ,  okay ,  and that's what I've also been thinking now ,  because no ,  I don't have a cellular phone ,  for example
Ah . 
but is too much limitation ,  when one is not home they can't find you ,  if someone wants to get in touch with you
Sure ,  yes
then yes ,  yes ,  sometimes they consider a ,  yes I consider that the cellular is very necessary but I had held off in buying it because ,  well ,  I would say ,  well is going to be very expensive . 
Depends on the plan ,  the plan one uses ah mm ,  is that now Sprint bought Nextel and ,  and
Aha . 
if they give the incoming calls free is ,  it comes out favorable right ?  because one pays more or less like sixty dollars a month and can use the phone however
you know ,  they give three hundred or fiv  I ,  I pay ,  I ,  they give me five hundred minutes and I can use it whenever I want but Nextel
ah ,  when you finish the call only that ,  you pay for that ,  those seconds that you used
Aha . 
in other companies they charge per minute . 
They round out the minute ,  right ?  yes
Sure ,  yes .  In Nextel no ,  in Nextel is for a   the six seconds only .  Then more calls
Exactly And
and ,  yes ,  yes you are paying for the incoming calls one can talk for hours and hours ,  they don't charge you . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes .  And
Oh ,  for ,  for me they are the
and other companies also charge the incoming ,  right ?  The calls that come in . 
yes ,  yes .  A com  a company that ,  that is doing this is Sprint ,  since Sprint bought Nextel
yes
ah mm ,  so ,  ah ,  mm ,  excuse me ,  ah ,  mm .  Since Sprint bought Nextel ,  then Nextel was the ,  the only company that was giving
free entries
Aha
so ,  so ,  since Sprint bought the company then Sprint has to do the same and right now Sprint is giving away the minutes ,  eh ,  the free minutes
they give you like three hundred or five hundred ,  three hundred minutes for thirty five dollars ,  well it's not that bad
Oh ,  it's pretty good ,  it's good to know because I am about to buy ,  one of these days ,  a cellular phone ,  and maybe
Mm
because I'm moving
Aha
and where we are going ,  there is no telephone line yet ,  so it will be necessary buying the cellular ,  so it's good to know about Sprint
Oh ,  yes ,  buts you also have to pay attention to the ,  to the ,  ah mm ,  powers you have ,  because if the service doesn't have them there
I mean ,  then you can't just buy ,  if
Oh ,  ok ,  also that ,  yes
who has the best ah mm
Reception
Sure
Aha
I ,  I once bought a telephone of T mobile and ,  sin  ,  I was ,  I ,  I was living in New York
when I moved here ,  because it was dif  I was on the road and I always was dropping calls
Ah ,  yes ?   T mobile ? 
on ,  on the street . 
Hmm . 
yes .   Oh yes ,  you know so ,  but in the city ,  T mobile is excellent but out here ,  in Connecticut ,  it's not worth it
Aha . 
so ,  it depends on the zone . 
And in exchange ,  does Spring have good reception ?   Does Sprint work well ? 
For where I live yes . 
Okay .   Okay ,  But I will ,  I will pay attention
So ,  it depends
eh ,  so I have good reception where I go ,  this is certain . 
Sure .   Because you have to be like this
This is true .   And what do you think about if there should be a law
well yes ,  if you don't have
to control the use of cell phones when people are driving ? 
This ,  it's the same ,  the say that ,  that you have to ,  ah ,  put on your seat belt ,  there are people who do it ,  people who don't do it ,  but
this is ,  this something where they say ,  like the law is for insurance and nothing more because if you
Aha . 
if you ,  say ,  have an accident ,  they will ask ,  oh ,  cell phone ?   They will say that you can't
That's ,  right .  Right ,  right ,  right . 
but they can't give you ,  if you don't know what the police are doing you don't ,  you don't have anything it's  ,  nothing to do . 
If you don't have anything to do ,  they give you a ticket but there's not one looking at the ,  at the people who are using their phones in the car
because everyone does it .  Everyone's doing it ,  there the law says that you can't use your phone and ,  everyone ,  I've seen ,  and also it's true that the phones ,  the police look at your phone
and it's the law . 
Uh ,  yea it's ,  it's the law now ?  I didn't know that it was an approved law
Oh ,  yea . 
to drive ,  uh ,  okay . 
That's because the passed the law that you have to use a device to to have your hands free
Right ,  mhm . 
and ,  and that people don't use it because ,  uh ,  no ,  no ,  really that doesn't work well ,  but now it's ,  there's ,  there are more things that people can use ,  there's o  ,  different te  ,  technologies that have
it's called Bluetooth it's something like you put it in your ear
yea . 
they just give you ,  but it's expensive ,  it's like one hundred and fifty dollars
Uh ,  uh huh . 
more ,  more the phone ,  but I mean ,  you don't have to use the phone ,  you've got ,  the phone you can put it in your purse or ,  or in your pants or whatever
and ,  when a call comes in it's like having the phone to your ear ,  just
Uh huh . 
it's pretty ,  pretty cool ,  but no ,  it's expensive ,  it's all expensive .  The ,  the th  ,  the ,  the games no  ,  nowadays
yea ,  yea ,  yea ,  yea ,  yes .  Right . 
It's ,  they are very expensive
And every time ,  ah ,  that technology advances
Electronics are very expensive .  Of course . 
I say ,  it's always very attractive and all ,  but it's true eh ,  that you have to have money to buy them ,  no ? 
yes ,  yes .  Yes ,  they go ,  expensive ,  yes ,  and no ,  and no ,  and telephones are not cheap ,  they go for three hundred pesos ,  four hundred dollars ,  and the attachments to use the ,  for hands free ,  go for one hundred and fifty . 
So then by the time you are done ,  you've spent like five hundred dollars on a telephone . 
yes ,  exactly . 
And in ,  in one year it's already
And afterwards ,  well ,  then you have to maintain it ,  because also the contracts are minimum of one year ,  right ? 
Not just one year ,  then eh ,  like Sprint says oh ,  you have to ah ,  sign for two years ,  because they say that it's not good
to make a two year contract because you don't know if the company is going to change ,  or always ,  always it's better to choose ,  only a one year contract
One year contract ,  uh huh . 
Because one year is good ,  it's ,  it's a lot because the company goes ,  there is another ,  or there are other companies that come out that can ,  if ,  it's better they can give you a ,  a cheaper price
Exactly ,  so then eh ,  uh
because as you have ,  like you have
you want a change ,  no ? 
Of course ,  yes . 
And ,  and well ,  does Sprint have this ,  of the ,  eh ,  mm ,  like T mobile has for family members ,  that you can talk amongst yourselves ,  or not ? 
Yes ,  Sprint has it . 
Ah ,  as well . 
yes ,  Sprint has family ,  family
No ,  well
with Sprint I think that the ,  the free minutes begin at seven at night .   With ,  with other companies they begin at nine . 
You know the ,  the night and weekends is what they call this
Aha ,  aha . 
The nights and weekends from Sprint begin at seven at night . 
No ,  well that's awesome then . 
Yes it's re  really good ,  eh ,  no ,  it's early ,  because what happens is that like with Nextel ,  you need to wait until nine . 
yes . 
to make free calls . 
No ,  the word that I said was it's awesome like it's cool . 
oh ,  no Okay
Because ,  because in Mexico we use the word awesome ,  it's awesome ,  to say it's all good ,  it's cool
Oh ,  Okay .   No ,  my companies ,  you know ,  I work in a metals factory and all my kids are ,  eh ,  Mexicans ,  and I get along really well with them ,  they're good people
Aha . 
They work really ,  they need to give the Mexicans a lot of credit for that
Ah ,  good ,  good . 
Hmm .   What part of Mexico are you from ? 
This ,  we come from Mexico City . 
Oh ,  yeah ?   Mexico City
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
Okay ,  ah ,  cool ,  I was there once . 
Eh ,  yes ,  but now it's a huge city
I was in front of
Hello . 
Hello ? 
Hello ,  do you speak Spanish ? 
yes ,  hello . 
Ah ,  how are you ? 
Good ,  and you ? 
Good .  What's your name ? 
Maria . 
Maria .  I'm Pilar . 
Now . 
Um .  What do you think of cell phones ? 
I like them a lot . 
Do you have one ? 
Yes ,  I have one . 
And ,  I don't .  I don't have one . 
And you ?  Ah . 
Ah .  Before ,  when I was in Europe I did have one .  But here in the United States
Ah ,  where . 
They're very expensive and I don't have one . 
And where did you live ? 
In New York
Ah okay
And you ? 
In Florida . 
In Florida and there ,  people have ,  everybody has a cellphone ,  isn't it ? 
Yes ,  they all do . 
It's the same as here ,  that's the truth ,  all my friends have cellphones but ,  I have and it's pretty expensive ,  actually
yes ,  yes ,  I really like them ,  I can't imagine how it'll be if I didn't have one . 
How long have you owned a cellphone . 
Um ,  for about ,  seven years . 
Seven years by now . 
Hum . 
But ,  that long ,  people ,  seven years ago they weren't so popular ,  right ? 
No ,  not that much but I got one as soon as they came out . 
Mm ,  and what do you think of the people that use them while in the streets and ,  eh ? 
Eh ,  I don't know ,  it's a bit annoying sometimes ,  when you are watching a movie
yes . 
and a cellphone starts ringing
yes . 
Eh ,  or someone is calling . 
Eh ? 
Driving ,  yes ah driving . 
Ah ,  yes yes . 
yes . 
Ah ,  yes well .  I think it's dangerous . 
yes ,  yes . 
That I know it's dangerous .  And what do you think about what they say ?  That the radiation might be bad ?  Of the phones .  Do you think is bad ? 
Mm .  I haven't heard much of that .  I don't know .  I hope not .  What do they say ? 
No ,  they say well .  They say that it's not known .  There are no studies . 
Uh uh . 
And confirm that is not bad
Oh , okay
But there are also no studies that confirm that it is bad So ,  there are not enough studies . 
Oh ,  okay
Is but ,  that the bad thing is .  That the people are already using them ,  so much . 
Mm . 
Without being confirmed that nothing happens .  That there is no problem . 
Mm . 
And that's why ,  there are people that typically use the earphones
Mm . 
And is there .  And the phone lower to not have an antenna . 
Mm . 
Next to the head . 
Oh ,  okay
Me ,  not me .  That gets me a little Is a little strange because I don't have a cellular . 
Oh really . 
yes because .  Just in case .  Just in case ,  I .  Can't pay anything ,  for me it would be
Mm . 
an effort because the minimum would be ,  would be fifty per month
yes .  More or less . 
something like that .  And I pay much less for my land line . 
Mm . 
And it's not known if it's safe .  right ? 
Sure . 
Well ,  I .  Maybe ,  I could be a little wrong . 
Mm .  okay
And .  What else can we talk about ? 
And where are you from ? 
I lived in Spain . 
Ah okay
In Madrid . 
What part ? 
Are you from the United States or ? 
Eh ,  from Puerto Rico . 
Ah ,  from Puerto Rico . 
yes . 
Ah Mm . 
And you've called here a lot ? 
Ah .  Here like this system . 
Uh uh . 
Is the third call . 
Ah okay
what was I going to tell you .  Have you heard the phones ?  Have you heard the new phones that have come out now ? 
Eh . 
The modern ones that you can watch TV and everything . 
Ah ,  yes yes . 
Is that high fashion in the United Stater or ? 
yes ,  yes . 
And do you want to have one of those or not ? 
Eh .  For now .  Because .  The one I have has a camera but I don't use it that much . 
Yeah . 
Eh ,  so no ,  you don't really use it for this . 
yes ,  because it's more expensive for one . 
Mm .  O yes ,  it's more expensive . 
And I don't know ,  you now ,  if it's worth the penalty
Sure . 
You don't use the internet much ? 
The internet ,  yes
But you wouldn't use this telephone ? 
Yes .   Huh ? 
You wouldn't use this telephone ? 
No ,  no . 
It's pretty small ,  right ? 
Sure ,  it's uncomfortable ,  yes .   Yes ,  there's people who send a lot of messages ,  text messages ,  but . 
Yeah ,  there are people who use ,  I've seen people with this telephone . 
Hmm . 
Because in Spain ,  it's really in Spain ,  when the cell phones came out
hum . 
Text messages got really popular because they were cheaper . 
Or yeah ,  than speaking ? 
It was very ,  yes ,  it was very expensive . 
Hmm
Eh .   And the majority of people who had mobiles were almost always the young people ,  students . 
Hmm . 
And this is good money .  So ,  eh ,  are you there ? 
yes . 
Ah . 
yes ,  it's mobile
What are you going to do with a mobile or what ? 
It's that ,  it doesn't ring because I have a message . 
Ah .   That ,  the telephones .   Calling is more expensive and the messages .   They were better some ,  few cents for the message . 
Hmm . 
And so since people were always writing messages .   I used it almost like a chat
Ah ,  yes . 
yes ,  I used it a lot ,  a lot .   And people also are really able to write because on the mobile phone you write with letters . 
yes ,  it's uncomfortable . 
No ,  uncomfortable .  And it costs .   But they do it quickly . 
Oh yes . 
There were contests to see who was the fastest writer . 
Ah
And
yes ,  here I don't think that has taken root so much
Here I have seen people talking about it
yes
Because since it's very expensive ,  if you have a phone the calls are already included
yes ,  it's more comfortable
So ,  you don't have to worry about that .  So ,  that didn't exist there ,  I paid for every call
Mm
And it was really expensive ,  and the messages were on the rage .  People uses it although it's not so expensive now
Is it still expensive there ? 
They already like it ,  right ? 
Is it still expensive talking on the phone there ? 
No ,  not that much
Oh ,  OK
But people use it already ,  because they like it
They got used to it
And ,  I don't know ,  it's like a culture ,  the culture of sending messages
Mm
And ,  and here it's different .  Here ,  as far as I have seen
yes ,  Here everybody is talking all the time .  In the car ,  in the shop ,  everywhere
yes .  And what do you think of the people The people that are on the streets that have earphones ,  they don't carry the phone ?  Have you seen them ? 
Oh yes ,  it looks as if they are talking to themselves . 
yes
Or ,  they are talking to you ,  I ask them what ,  they tell me ,  no I'm talking . 
yes You are talking to the boyfriend and is talking in the back .  And
yes . 
And look he's already with the cell phone
yes ,  a lot of people ,  I don't like to use that .  I prefer the phone . 
Like yes well is the phone . 
In other words I prefer
That earphone . 
Uh uh .  I don't like the
You don't like that ,  why not ? 
No .  I don't know .  I don't .  I don't like it . 
And how . 
Have that inserted like that in the ear . 
Eh ,  okay .  And ,  what model phone do you have ? 
Eh ,  One ,  I have Sprint And is one of those that fold . 
Ah ,  um .  And ,  is it small ? 
yes ,  is small .  But not so small that it's uncomfortable ,  I mean that
Why ?  Ah . 
good size . 
Because ,  seven years ago the size has decreased . 
Oh really ,  the first one I had looked like a big ten . 
yes . 
And now already they've gone smaller . 
You have them still because comparing them already the laughter I have it
no .  I gave it away .  I think I gave it away a while back . 
Okay .  I still have the first one I got . 
Really . 
And I ask myself how I was able to carry that thing .  In my purse
yes .  I've had ,  this one is the third one . 
yes . 
No ,  the fourth .  I've had three others .  And each time they've gotten smaller . 
Of course ,  each smaller .  And I can't do anything anymore because it does call no . 
yes . 
You have nothing to hold it
Mm . 
Ah .  Mm .  And what does your phone have ,  does it have a camera ? 
yes it has a camera ,  it has some games but I didn't install them .  I hardly use the camera .  Eh . 
And
And you connect to the Internet but I don't use it . 
And you have ringtones and that ,  a lot ? 
Eh .   yes .   Like .   You have to buy them separate though .   I don't use this either .   I use .   Normal . 
And does it seem like people who have ringtons are that rare ? 
Eh ,  yes .   Many people have songs ,  different songs .   Eh .   And different .   I don't know .   Some .   Each one has it's one theme . 
yes ,  it's a thing that in Europe I realize that I think that in Europe it's a craze . 
Oh ,  yes . 
Having the mobile phone with you is really fashionable
uh huh .   Oh yeah ? 
Your distinct from everyone and you're more original . 
Uh huh . 
It's really important for the young people . 
yes . 
And you spend a lot of money because it's costs after you download it from the telephone .   You take a number
Oh yeah ? 
And you download the tone to your telephone . 
Oh . 
And it costs but a few cents ,  two cents ,  three cents .   And the people .   If you change each month ,  you change the tone and put it on .   The popular song or a rare song . 
Ah ,  okay
And they have all the sounds .  From an ambulance to the sound of a persons saying ,  I don't know ,  whatever .  Even phrases ,  sometimes ,  from a TV show
oh ,  really ? 
That has become popular ,  the phrase
Mm
someone said .  And then people put it in their cell phones
oh
and that's funny
yes
Now nothing scares you ,  but at that time .  .  .  Well ,  sometimes we are together
Oh yes
Ambulance ,  or the sound of an old telephone ,  a ring ring telephone like the ancient ones ,  right ? 
Uh uh .  OK
And maybe you are in the bus and it's horrible ,  and you just think
I had never heard the ambulance one
Right ,  yes ,  right .  The truth is that I am a little disconcerted ,  just figure out the elder people ,  the grand dads and grand moms
Oh yes
Who just don't get used to technology .  All this must seem so strange
And there is more every day
yes .  Oh ,  what else did you want to talk about ? 
Oh ,  laws they have done like for instance in Puerto Rico ,  where you can't drive and talk by cellular at the same time
Ah on ,  well ,  that's true . 
No .   Eh . 
In the day
Eh ,  why . 
Ah ,  here they're starting . 
yes . 
I didn't know ,  I thought that it was forbidden but people do it . 
Oh yeah ? 
The do it because they don't see the police ,  they do it
Ah . 
And if they see ,  they give them a fine . 
Ah . 
But ,  here it doesn't seem permitted . 
Yes ,  here you can .   yes ,  so if they stop you and give you a ticket ,  but what happens is people stop in the middle of the street to talk . 
Ah yes . 
yes . 
yes ,  it's permitted
yes ,  because they're not driving and it's not that ,  but
Well . 
Hello ,  yes
Hello ?  oh ,  yes ,  this is Alex ,  I live in Los Angeles ,  who is that ? 
this is Tami ,  I live in Seattle ,  Alex ,  haven't we talked before ? 
oh ,  second time this week ,  yes ,  yes
aha ,  about the salsa ,  aha ,  I recalled your voice ,  so ,  what do you think about cellular phones ? 
oh ,  well ,  they have some advantages and disadvantages ,  I have never had one ,  mainly because of the cost but I see that ,  ah ,  sometimes people is driving
and that's dangerous because they don't focus on driving
yes
and other times ,  you are in the cinema and hear people talking on the phone ,  and that is annoying
I mean ,  yes ,  that I find very annoying ,  when you are at the cinema trying to watch the movie and they are talking ,  or they give it to their sons to play with it
games in the cellular and the light ,  also disturbing the people that talks out loud in restaurants
yes ,  that too
if you want me to listen to your conversation you better sit by my side ,  because ,  yes
thank you
because ,  it's true ,  people ,  we ,  the car we own has that on star
oh that's really good ,  but see what happened to me the other day ,  I was in the free way
that also ,  aha
and my car broke down ,  it just stopped
ah
and I had to park it in the side ,  I was in the middle of the free way and since I don't have a cellular ,  it was late at night I had no way of communicating ,  then ,  eh
there is
I moved the car to the side and I had to walk on the road on the free way
aha
to a gas station to call on ,  on a public phone or a free poley or towing you understand me ?  ,  the tow truck
aha ,  yes ,  I know ,  I worked for them before
and ah ,  if there was ,  I thought ,  if ,  if I had a cellular ,  I could've used it for the emergency for emergencies the phone is very important
especially when one breaks down on ,  on a highway or in a ,  in a place where there's no one
yes
and then
it would be good if they would let one get a cellular that they would only have those eh ,  emergency phones
exactly ,  I don't know why they don't have those
and you would only pay ,  yes ,  only pay a little because it's not that much ,  because you wouldn't use it all of the time
I haven't seen emergency cellulars ,  because usually they cost a lot ,  you have a one year contract
mm
they have a contract of a lot of minutes I've never seen an emergency plan ,  only to use for an emergency because the companies
yes
only want to make money
yes
they don't want to help people
so eh ,  my son the ,  the oldest one my sister gave him one of those phones that you have to put the minutes
yes
so he likes it because since he doesn't use his cell phone all the time ,  he spends tell dollars every two months for ,  I think they give him twenty minutes
exactly ,  this is the best
and he has it if something happens I say ,  well ,  it's better to be paying thirty something dollars or more for something that I don't use that much ,  I don't have one ,  I had before
yes
but it's true ,  every now and then I say ,  yes ,  I need a cell phone now ,  but not all the time
yes ,  after this experience that I had on the freeway I realized ,  when I have money ,  I would like to have a cell phone like this for emergencies
aha
not to talk with fr  ,  with friends ,  not so it gets really expensive
yes ,  yes ,  this is true
but for me ,  emergencies ,  yes ,  it's it's absolutely necessary
yes ,  because it something happens to you like this when you're on the freeway
yes it was like ,  ah ,  eleven at night and it was totally unexpected that ,  ah ,  that my car broke down on the freeway
it's really dangerous at that time because the cars are going really cast and they don't see the car ,  a stranded car ,  its gruesome ,  exactly ,  and ,  and these dangers could have been avoided if I had had a cell phone
and no one sees you
because I would have called the freeway police directly
hmm yes
but I didn't have it so the cell phones are really advantageous for the ,  the emergencies
yes
and also ,  as we've said ,  they're bothersome too
yes ,  and everyone wants ,  here I have mine who's sixteen who says that he wants one ,  and he saw one that was free ,  I say free only for the telephone but for the contract ,  come over here
and I said ,  you have to pay this contract and I said ,  who will pay it ,  you ,  how you talk but you don't notice ?   I say ,  I'm going to have more minu 
minutes that I have to pay for this ,  so I say ,  no man
they asked you for a contract ?   hmm
ah ,  yes ,  I said ,  no ,  no I don't want this ,  and I said to him ,  what for ?   for when you're at school and talking on the telephone ?   no
yes ,  also ,  I'm a teacher sometimes in the schools
aha
and I've had many problems with kids who want to talk on their cell in class ,  ah ,  it's really bothersome for the person who's teaching
hmm
it's a serious problem ,  but everyone says that ,  ah ,  they need the telephone if they have an emergency and the mom or the dad has to call
but I think that it's ,  more than anything lies because they're using it for friends more than anything ,  friends
hmm ,  yes
and ,  and it's a distraction for the study plan
yes ,  this ,  this is true
yes
because I say ,  I say ,  this is what I told my son ,  I said ,  but I told him ,  if I have an emergency and you're in school ,  I call the school
they find you and they call you ,  I said ,  but to call the classroom I can't do this ,  because you'll disturb somebody
and many of the bad kids
aha
use the ,  the ,  what's it called ?   the walkie talkie
aha
to talk to his gang friends ,  during school days
oh
so ,  this has become a serious problem for schools
yes ,  so ,  here I was hearing that soon with these phones with cameras
yes
I heard that they share the ,  the test answers
Oh ,  really ? 
yes ,  they take a picture with the camera and then they send the answers one another
that's why there are so many of them in the classrooms ,  I have never noticed that
aha ,  because you have not noticed ,  that's what I heard ,  and I was with my son now ,  and he told me ,  mom they are already sending the ,  the notes to each other ,  since they know it's the same test ,  they send them
so you know ,  now you see you don't
oh boy ,  I'm terrified ,  I think it's true because I have seen ,  well ,  I am giving the exams ,  I am a substitute
aha
I see a lot of these camera phones
aha
and ,  and ,  I thought ,  what the hell do these students need the phones for ? 
for that ,  for that
I th  I thought they were taking pictures of me
no ,  they get out of the classroom ,  another one comes in and they send him the answers
oh my god
yes ,  that's what they are saying ,  that this is happening in junior high and in college ,  it's like you know ?  the camera ,  you can watch movies ,  it's like ,  I mean a video
a a video ,  so they can
yes
they can show you everything and the other person in the next room is watching it
exactly ,  that's ,  that's why oh ,  I believe some schools have prohibited them . 
mm
and if we catch the boy with a cellphone during class ,  we take it away from him and his parents ,  his parents have to come pick it up at the office
at the office
and many of them start to argue and you argue with them and you have to have them leave the class
I mean ,  that's what I'm talking about ,  why do you want ,  why do you fight for a phone if you don't need one during classes ?  You are supposed to be paying attention . 
yes ,  I ,  I do understand now ,  many tell us that they have a right to have their cellphones with them in the even of emergency . 
but
but ,  that's a lie
well ,  if you are in school ,  that's what I think ,  if you are in school ,  you can be called at the office ,  they will go look for you ,  it's not that hard ,  if you ,  if you ,  you just have to go to the office and tell them that you have to leave
because of an emergency ,  you can't just leave school like that ,  well ,  some do ,  but
yes
but ,  I don't ,  no ,  the children ,  I don't buy them ,  I've seen kids of around six years old with phones
wow
I mean ,  what do you do ,  I tell them ,  who are you calling ,  Barney ,  who ?  grandma ?  well ,  borrow ,  borrow your mother's phone
I was yesterday in the mall and the little girl ,  the mom on a phone ,  the little girl on another ,  this is insolence ,  but well
that's too young to have a cellu 
yes ,  I say well ,  when already ,  at six you give them a cellular I imagine what that girl is going to ask for at sixteen
yes ,  and the cellular among the youths is being used for the wrong reasons ,  for wrong reasons ah ,  not for ,  not for good things
no ,  no
especially in ,  in the boys and also the other problem with the cellular is the problem of the accidents on the  ,  on the roads
yes
many people are ,  are getting harmed or serious injuries ,  or ,  or die for being ,  for being distracted when they are driving
yes here in Washington state if you cause an accident and and is because you were using the cellular ,  the ticket they give you is higher
but very few get it
more costly ,  yes that's true
because I always when I'm driving I see people with the cellulars in their hand
mm
sure ,  now ,  eh ,  they have a more legal system of using it like a microphone
aha
and they don't have to use the phone itself
yes
and they talk through the microphone
yes that's like my car ,  that I was telling you has the on star
mm
then ,  it also has telephone ,  and you press the button only once and after that you ask it to call someone ,  you just say the name and brand
And start talking
no ,  those microphones are connected to the cellphone
Mmm
it's for talking on the car ,  and you don't have to use your hands
I see
Is not a big distraction
It's really simple ,  I don't like people who is not paying attention ,  or having in the hand a cigarette ,  in the other hand a cellphone and moving their leg
 , 
and well ,  I say to my husband ,  move ,  I want to kill that man ,  if something happens ,  the cigarette drops or
look down ,  and does not see ,  I mean ,  shameless
yes
I mean ,  you can't do that many things in a car
No ,  and now ,  many people things they are crazy ,  talking alone and what happens is that they are talking
yes
Hello ,  good afternoon . 
yes good afternoon . 
Ah ,  nice to meet you ,  how are you ? 
Same .  Fine ,  and you ? 
Ah .  Fine thanks .  My name is Josefina in Philadelphia .  And you ? 
Now in Atlanta . 
Ah ,  Audio .  In Atlanta . 
yes . 
Ah ,  a pleasure ,  have you been already several eh weeks with this plan or are you starting ? 
No ,  this is the fourth call I've completed . 
Ah ,  wow how nice .  And
yes ,  because the first ones they called me almost always at very inconvenient times . 
Really . 
yes . 
Can you excuse me I'm going to change phone .  One second .  Don't hang up . 
Yes okay . 
Don't hang up . 
Mm . 
Hello ? 
yes ,  hello
Hello ?  Ah ,  okay ,  I was there with my dad and
Okay
the TV is on .  And then this man ,  about some topic I don´t but sometimes you ,  how do you say it ?  repeat yourself over and over again ,  I don´t know
Do you
yes ,  yesterday we had the same topic as today
Ah ,  cell phone ,  right ? 
Cell phone
I do what I can ,  ok ,  let´s do what we can ,  I don´t know
when I applied for this study ,  I was told that in this study there would be no topic
No .  That´s what I
regulative
I understood as well .  But
But whatever
Whatever ,  I talk a little about one thing ,  a little about another
yes
But it´s interesting to talk with people from other states .  Where I have never lived at .  And it´s ,  well ,  I don´t know ,  I like to know a little about people
But ,  the only think I´ll say is that cell phones ,  I was surprised that people have very particular ,  very private conversations in public
before
yes
people tried to hide in a phone booth or something ,  no ? 
That's really true
to not be heard ,  right ? 
yes ,  it's really true ,  I have note several
And then
times I have to cover the ears of a four year old because they are saying
Ah
words ,  that ,  well ,  you know
You see ,  and one whing ,  when you are on a bus ,  and it's full ,  well ,  sometimes there are 4 or 5 people talking on
their cellphone .  And particular things about their boyfriends ,  things they eat or will eat ,  and things you should not care about ,  but
Those are topics none cares ,  And then I don't agree with it
No ,  well ,  what I critic is
And
because I see many of that here is that there is
Oh
Situation that are not appropriate to talk over the phone ,  for example ,  if you are in a restaurant ,  or are in the
Mmm
Cinema ,  or it's following
Mmm ,  that's the worse
That's the worse
I at least drive ,  but I pull over each time the cellphone rings ,  when I can ,  right ? 
yes ,  right
if possible .  I mean that if you are distracted using the phone you may have an accident
Sometimes I get distracted just talking to the person that is with me in the car
But that's is ,  right ?  We think about other things ,  and we should be more concentrated .  Do you drive ? 
Have you
yes ,  yes
Oh ,  you don't use the cell phone either ? 
Well ,  I look to see who is calling ,  and if it somebody I want to talk to and I am getting to a red light
then I answer .  And I tell him I am driving ,  I'll call you back
Oh ,  that's fine
but if not I just don't answer .  And then when I get to my destiny I check who called .  And if it is very important
Oh
I call him back
Right .  I think so ,  I agree with you in not answering ,  maybe before when I worked as a
a work where I had to attend calls ,  emergency calls from children ,  right ?  .  When I worked with children
yes
abuse or abandon .  Sometimes your work demands you answering but I always the chance to stop
to the right .  At any hole I found there I stoped
Or if  , specially if it something else
or a restaurant
of emergency ,  you have to pay attention
yes ,  yes .  But since I knew I had to note down things ,  the kid's directions ,  all the more reason to stop .  But now I don't work in that any more
I get the idea already ,  you have to stop because
yes
what would you think if someone was driving and talking ,  and took out a pencil and paper to note it down ,  some people do it
some people do anything ,  but
yes .  But anyway some people do a lot of things in the
good heavens
car ,  they put make up on ,  or
oh ,  mm ,  sure
some things that you just go ,  wow
They even read ,  and food of course ,  they eat ,  and if they have to check something in their daily agenda or put something down in it
Even carry a notebook ,  I haven't put it for that reason .  A notebook and a pen next to the steering wheel ,  but
People nowadays live their life too .  . 
Oh
fast . 
I think so
Do you know a
I don't know ,  do you work ? 
yes .  Oh yes ,  I work in an office nine to five and then pick up the girl because
Ah . 
single mother . 
Uh uh . 
And she picked it up .  You know ,  I take care of her during the afternoon and that's it . 
yes .  Mm . 
But you
that sucks . 
You know ,  I got to a point in which I know I'm only thirty one years old but I got to a point where ,  you know ,  you have to chooses in life
because life passes by too quickly . 
That's right . 
Yes ,  you go
Exactly
you run through it and you can't really enjoy special moments . 
Exactly ,  I don't understand how is it that everyone wants to be lighter ,  lighter ,  they even take pills that wake you up ,  they sell them in the pharmacist ,  they contain caffeine I mean ,  pills
they'll live
yes
They have a name ,  they say it's to keep you alert ,  so you can study and I think I mean ,  if we have to do so many things
things ,  right ? 
yes
The news ,  the television ,  the family ,  problems ,  b ills to pay ,  I think we already have enough to also get in
Maybe not the cell phone ,  but the lifestyle of living so fast . 
perhaps that´s why most people use pills for depression . 
I see my son who is older and married . 
He says I have to go ,  I have to go ,  I´m in a hurry .  I´ll call you later ,  everything is about time . 
And you never know what´s going to happen because even on Sundays
he is always running late .  .  . 
yes
I feel shy . 
But you know people notice that all the time
oh . 
This happens to everyone like when I was younger I lost my boyfriend ,  and I also had a good relationship with his mom . 
Mm . 
We were very closed ,  I love her very much . 
Oh , 
Like I said I was 18 years old there was always something to do . 
Always in a hurry
Blah blah blah ,  she had called me to let me know that they could not find the old San Juan . 
Oh ,  okay
I kept telling her that it was ok ,  until one day that she heard me . 
really . 
And so I tried to look for her and when I called work they told me no ,  Leticia died last week ,  and I said ,  what ? 
My goodness ,  how awful ,  this was over there in Puerto Rico ? 
In Puerto Rice and so this what the moment when I said that one can't
Oh . 
be running so much and living so quickly because
I say this too . 
you don't know how long you will have something . 
How long you will have this chance ,  right ? 
yes . 
And yes it's true .   You see it to with your family and I ,  since I'm older you could say ,  I know that
I'm older and nevertheless I also regret knowing things that I didn't do for mom when she was alive or how many times she would call me and I told her
I'll call you more ,  like how my son tells me . 
Exactly . 
Or I have to do this ,  I can't talk to you now .   We can't talk now and this .   But how . 
Well and
No one is perfect ,  right ?   No ? 
No ,  you don't know how live will be ,  anyways and you always think the best that you're fine and nothing bad will ever happen
to you
Uh huh . 
and these thoughts make you say I'll call you later .   We'll meet up later
And to your son ,  also ,  because you have to sleep ,  you have to
yes
shower and quickly to school ,  and it upsets me because sometimes I would like to spend more time with them ,  right ?  But I was always working
yes
And my son was still a baby ,  and yet
yes
I was always in a rush .  I think my mom took more care of him than myself .  But this is something you learn afterwards ,  isn't it ? 
Exactly
Thank goodness you noticed earlier ,  though .  Sometimes it takes years for you to notice
No ,  if it had not been for that ,  I would probably still
that you don't have to
be with that
racing all the time ,  yes ,  we talk after and I'll tell you .  And have you been here in Georgia for a long time ?  In the State ? 
I've been here for ten  , eleven years ,  already
Oh
I came here to study at Georgia Tech
how good ,  did you graduate ? 
yes ,  and then I stayed here ,  I met the father of my daughter ,  I fell in love ,  we stayed together for seven ,  eight years ,  and
Uh uh
when we separated ,  well ,  by that time my mom had already moved here ,  my brother had moved here ,  my whole family was here
Ah
why leave . 
Wow Look and The hurricane didn't affect you ? 
No . 
Ah ,  that's good . 
What's more to have that week that happened over there ,  the temperature was ,  the weather was really nice . 
Mm ,  how nice and did you guys get a lot of people from there also ?  The ones that were going to other states ? 
yes ,  yes a lot of people came here . 
I think that it's really beautiful there ,  because you see it there on tv ,  I saw it when it was the Olympics ,  I saw it . 
yes . 
And in and eh ,  now always in the news it comes out ,  a lot of events ,  a lot of important things of
yes ,  I love Georgia .  I think I'm staying until God wants you know I like it a lot . 
all possible .  ah ,  and is the climate always like that like Miami ? 
no ,  no ,  not so much . 
Hot ? 
Because here we have the winter although is not a very strong winter but we have it . 
No ,  in . 
the cold doesn't arrive til like January and it leaves in March . 
But it doesn't snow ? 
But every now and then I would say every three years it snows . 
Ah that's perfect . 
Exactly . 
Here in Philadelphia we have the snow up to our necks every year . 
Hello ? 
Hello . 
Ah ,  how are you ?   What's your name ? >
Junior .   Whom am I speaking with ? 
Sorry ? 
With whom am I speaking ?   Junior . 
Junior ,  I'm Pilar .

Oh ,  how old are you ? 
Eh ,  twenty five
Oh .   And you live in Spain ? 
No ,  I live in New York . 
oh ,  good ,  what part of New York ? 
We have to talk about mobile phones ,  yeah ,  ¿right ? 
Uh ,  i think i was told the subject was marriage and ,  but i think this system is damaged because it's always marriage . 
Well ,  it always tells me about cellphones . 
I think that it depends ,  because there is some people i know ,  i don't know them ,  but i have spoken to them and they are from Washington and they tell them about music
It always says to them music ,  it tells me marriage . 
Well it always tells me mobile phones .  Well ,  i don't know what you want to talk about
Anything ,  again . 
Well ,  well
The mobile phones are good
It's the third day of talking about mobile phones and i don't know what to say
Yeah ,  i mean ,  they are good .  They get you out of trouble if you have to make a call ,  well ,  they have
¿Do you ,  do you have a cell phone ? 
And in case of emergency .  Oh ,  Yeah ,  i have two
¿Yeah ? 
Yeah ,  well not two ,  but one is the ,  uh
¿What's that about the ? 
Yeah ,  it's called Nextel
¿Yeah ?  ,  i don't know that
That's like a Palm Pilot
¿Like a what ? 
Like a Palm Pilot
Oh ,  yes ,  yes
like a computer
yes ,  like a PDA
yes ,  and then I have a regular one
Oh ,  those are bigger ,  right ? 
Yes ,  it's pretty big
Sure
I have a service ,  it has been like a year and a half contract so far ,  but I have this with a new contract from Nextel
And how log have you had that cellphone ? 
I have cellphone since I was 13 years ,  12 years old
that long ? 
I have 22 years old now
Oh
But ,  ever since I was in junior high i have cellphone
Since you had 13 years old ? 
Yes ,  12 or 13 years
Well ,  that's like 10 years ago ,  that's a long time
And ,  have you had a cellphone for a long time ? 
I don't have one
Or you don't have one ? 
I don't have a phone because now that I'm in the United States but when I was Europe ,  I had one .  But now here it's more expensive . 
yea ,  where in New York are you ? 
In Manhattan . 
Oh ,  it's in the Bronx .  But there's lots of plans that are like pre paid
Uh huh
pre paid and um they give you nights and weekends free with long distance included
Ah ,  really ? 
You don't have to have a contract ,  yea
Ah well I well I'm not familiar with it ,  do you have to pay for the phone ,  or no ? 
Yea ,  for the phone yes but ifeyou buy it like through Cingular which is ATT and now they have some that are pretty cheap .  For the regular phone
like thirty dollars and for forty pesos a month they give you free nights and weekends ,  and free long distance
Right ,  but for me forty dollars a month is a lot . 
That's a lot for me too that's why the other one ran out on me on the contract but the one I have now is is pre paid .  But I pay whenever I want and it's more than
Ah . 
for the use of walkie talkies for my
Right ,  that's what I had in Europe when I had ,  it was called a card ,  it's pre paid . 
Yea .  Yes ,  here the one I have like it's Spanish
Yea but well so what was happening to me was that people could call but I would almost never make a call because it would cost me ,  because it's more expensive if it's prepaid ,  the calls are more expensive . 
So ever since that time I stopped it and I say yea plus like I'm not sure ,  if they're bad for your health or not
yes .   yes but I don't use mine much because it's made of card . 
sure . 
I don't use it any more for the walkie talkie
yes . 
But to not , 
A these walkie talkies ,  I've seen them here .   Over in Europe they don't have them .   Out loud ,  out loud you talk to
yes .   yes . 
only short and change these things . 
Uh huh .   And what do you do here in New York ? 
Well this doesn't exist in Europe ah well at best ah ,  well it's been a year since I left Europe .   But when I left they still didn't have it
And what is distinct in Europe is the people eh ,  school ,  like the young people most of all ,  it was very fashionable to have the songs on the mobile ,  like the mobile
right right or something like that
Yes I know a song . 
they had songs ,  they had rare songs ,  here they don't have much of this ,  no ? 
Yes .   No ,  I don't have any of those . 
Sure here it hasn't ,  it hasn't arrived but there you can buy ,  you can call an automatic
yes . 
telephone and you download
yes . 
you download the music directly on your telephone
yes ,  yes ,  Here the same but those songs are also really expensive ,  they're like three dollars a song . 
yes well there also but people buy them . 
And what else ,  what New York
Eh ? 
what do you do there in New York ,  work ,  go to school or what ? 
Eh ,  I study ,  I'm a student ,  that's why I can't . 
Oh ,  you're a student ? 
yes . 
Where ? 
In the  NYU . 
Oh ,  in  NYU .  Oh .  I'm not working right now I live with my family .  But because I wanted to go to school to get the credits to become a cop . 
Ah ,  yes .

Of course
Oh ,  and how is going at school ?  what is he studying ? 
Oh ,  I study electrical engineering .  But ,  well ,  I am supposed to talk about the telephone ,  or else
ok ,  yes
Oh ,  we could also talk about ,  about ,  what we think about these regulations that ban talking by phone on the car ,  while driving ,  here you can talk while you drive  , can't you ? 
No
You can't ? 
No ,  here we have a lot of policeman ,  they do nothing but bother a lot
what ? 
they stop you and bog you because it's illegal ,  so many accidents ,  the usual . 
sure ,  sure ,  very dangerous .  The other day ,  someone one told me on the phone that it was allowed ,  I mean ,  talking while driving
And I told him ,  that can't be possible ,  it's absolutely baned
yes
Policemen look after that
No ,  I am ,  um ,  I am not a policeman yet ,  I'm just a volunteer ,  but I am with the police
oh ,  mm
And ,  do you know how many car accidents I have seen caused by talking on the phone ? 
Of course ,  because they don't focus on the road
Mm .  Os if they are ,  if they have on the lap and it suddenly rings
And they got a scare ,  sure ,  sure . 
Uh huh . 
It's very dangerous ,  and in the movie theater it's prohibited by the law but
no ,  of no . 
but it's really bothersome . 
Yeah they say that they turn it off but no
There's always someone who forgets . 
I don't turn mine off ,  I put it on vibrate . 
Sure while I'm not bothered one time I went to the movies
Yeah
and it was a film where I wasn't and the other group ,  my group and the other group all of a sudden in the middle off the movie it rings ,  the telephone on vibrate didn't ring
yes . 
but he answered it and started talking ,  and he started talking in the middle of the movie
yes yes many people have done that . 
a lack of education and all that . 
yes but we ,  how do you say I'm like this ?   I don't look for noise but if there's someone ,  we catch him ans we send him outside
yes but when he doesn't respond to something like that ,  because we told him to be quiet but
yes we said ,  shut your mouth ,  we're watching the movie . 
you
yes ,  everyone started ,  I said be quiet .   And we through something at him that we had .   I told him to be quiet and everyone started saying oh ,  shut up
the people pay for this . 
In the other ,  then what you've lost ,  you've lost in this movie . 
Hmm
Yeah ,  they don't give it back to you . 
Do you speak English ? 
yes . 
Hmm . 
Yes ,  but .   Not like how I speak Spanish .   It's not my native language . 
Hmm .   Hmm . 
English is better ? 
yes ,  give me a second . 
hello ? 
hello ? 
yeah ,  uh ,  uh
yes ,  sorry ,  it was a really important call that I had .   I couldn't miss it . 
so so ,  you were born here then ,  no ? 
yes ,  in New York .   Here in New York ,  not here in the Bronx . 
Well ,  you were born here in the United States ,  I'm saying . 
yes ,  in the United States .   I'm from Puerto ,  I'm Puerto Rican . 
Do you consider yourself to be Puerto Rican or from the United States ?   From Puerto Rico ,  surely . 
Umm .   yes ,  well here I don't know why like when they went to school we had to say where we were from ,  so I said we were Puerto Rican . 
I was born in New York but I said from what part of another place was I ,  I wanted to say Puerto Rico . 
Like ,  everyone is from another place . 
And what languages do you speak ? 
Well ,  English a little bit ,  and Spanish and a little bit of German but very little . 
Oh ,  German
yes . 
Oh ,  but you're from Spain ,  right ? 
yes ,  yes . 
Oh ,  I'm not sure but my grandmother ,  she was born over there in Spain . 
Ah yes . 
Yes but she brought her over here when she was young ,  when she was little . 
Hmm . 
on the ship and they took her to Puerto Rico . 
Hmm . 
Because her mom abandoned her
Oh . 
since the father had left . 
And the father went to ? 
And the father when with other kids
Yeah . 
Her last name is like
yeah .   It could be .   It doesn't sound from Spain but
Huh ?   I don't know either but since she's older like ninety three
yeah . 
I really don't know . 
And the rest of your family ,  they're all from Puerto Rico ? 
yes .   I also have Dominican family through marriage .   And black of all ,  all classes
yes ?   And you don't think about what you will do if you don't get into the police in the end ? 
If I don't get in ,  I want ,  um ,  to open a small shop ,  a little shop
of what ? 
of automobiles ,  cars
Yes ? 
cars or ,  um ,  something with food
Like
like a small restaurant . 
A restaurant or a deli ? 
Like a restaurant ,  or like a bar grill
Like what ? 
Like a bar grill
Oh ,  bar and grill ,  yeah
That ,  yeah ,  one of those two things
Uh huh
I have ,  but my first option is the police business ,  that's why i am not in school ,  because of that ,  because i am
But it's difficult to open your own business
hello hello eh whom am I speaking with ? 
hello ah I'm Laiya
Laiya ,  hi I'm Nicole
yes ,  how did you say ,  what's your name ? 
Nicole ,  Nicole
Nicole okay ,  very good nice to meet you
and how are you ? 
eh well from what I understood we don't have to talk about the phones well I call them mobiles I don't know
yes where are you from ? 
ah cellulars I'm from Barcelona ,  from Spain
ah from Barcelona ,  look
yes and you ? 
eh I was born here in New York but my family is Cuban
aha very good ,  very good
and and where do you live ? 
in Philadelphia ,  yes I study in the university of Pennsylvania in UPenn
ah in Philadelphia ,  and what do you think of the university there ? 
good I'm quite happy the university I mean is good
mm
and the campus is beautiful and well the city of Philadelphia has its areas next to its ugly areas but is not bad
mm
and it's close to New York also ,  so
you like New York
yes ,  yes ,  it's a very special city ,  but yes
m
well
how good ,  ehh ,  so ,  I don't know ,  what do you think about cellular phones ? 
Well I don't know ,  I don't have a cellular phone here ,  I've been living here for a year
mm mhm
and in the beginning ,  when I just arrived ,  ah ,  I did think of buying one immediately ,  because I missed it since I did have one in Spain
m
but afterwards I realized I didn't need it that much ,  and
I see
I don't know ,  that I live better without a cellular phone
m
and now I don't have it ,  I don't know
I see ,  look ,  there are not many people who don't have one ,  I mean
yes ,  yes ,  not too many ,  I miss it sometimes ,  I don't know
m
if you have an appointment and you are going to be late or things like this ,  then I wish I had a cellular phone
hmm
but but if not well ,  I don't know ,  also ,  for example ,  in the country there's internet all over so people can also communicate a lot by email
sure sure
you have umm
yes like if I have like if I'm talking with her and the other telephone is ringing it's terrible
what a coincidence
yes I don't know enough the telephone eh ,  I like to have it because well ,  I'm a teacher so ,  emm
aha
in the school it's really difficult to reach me ,  like ,  it's not like other people who work in offices
hmm
emm I'm always in class and when I'm in the office I also have to go out a lot
sure
like to make photocopies and
hmm
and move around in the building so
sure it's convenient ,  hmm
so having a cell phone so that people can leave me messages or
hmm
I'm out ,  same in New York it's really big so that sometimes
yes yes yes
I'm outside doing something
mm ,  mm
eh what I just don't like is to be tied to to the cellular in other words
to be too what ? 
tied like like like like I say like too connected to the cellular I mean I have it with me
okay okay okay that you depend too much on it not in a point in other words
but I have it with me but I mean if I'm with another person I don't answer it
mm
because I see it as a telephone
yes yes
that when you are home you answer the phone but when you are out
yes yes
the people leave messages so I see it like that if I'm not busy or I'm alone
mm ,  mm
or if I have to make specific plans with a specific person
mm ,  mm
then I do answer it but if I'm
mm
with another person and the cellular rings and is another friend well I talk to that friend later
yes yes it also bothers me a little if you are with other people
eh
no and you've been waiting to talk and they put you on the phone ,  I don't know ,  sometimes there's a lack of respect but well
sure and I also don't like answering and saying that I'm going to call later or like ,  I think that it's better simply not to answer because
hmm
there when you answer a conversation always starts
hmm hmm
and
it's difficult to get off if
if like the other person feels offended or like how to answer but I'm not going to talk now since like ,  like
hmm ,  hmm ,  mmm
I like to have it like ,  a place to leave messages if necessary
hmm ,  hmm
and after I call back or
yeah yeah yeah
oh
sometimes
I don't know ,  or also if I'm along or if I have to change plans ,  or like
hmm ,  hmm yes on this occasion it's really useful
I'm late or I have to go to another place
hmm ,  hmm
I prefer to do other things there yes it's good that I can locate people and that I can visit the others
m in Spain the the most common thing of all among adolescents
aha
is sending text messages with their cell phones
yeah
all day ,  I have a brother who's fifteen years old and all day he's text messaging his friends I mean
see
constantly ,  a constant thing ,  constantly ,  I mean he doesn't doesn't doesn't talk
ha
on the phone only texts all day
see how interesting
I think here it's not so good I I don't know but I think that
it's it's not so I mean I teach uh young teenagers I mean ones who are like fifteen ,  sixteen ,  seventeen
yes ah
and yes
and how is it
it's not not too bad they're immigrants and I teach English to immigrants
okay ,  okay
so they're not I think American teenagers are worse
mhm ,  yeah
But the immigrants really want to learn English and
hmm
and also are a bit more educated in the sense of not being so
hmm
like ,  they don't lack respect
yeah yeah
like the majority are very respectful ,  there are always some who aren't but
hmm ,  hmmmm
the majority are and I think that the other school where the Americans are ,  they aren't respectful ,  I know that they're
hmm
like this that they don't have many problems at times problems but no ,  always
very good and they're Latin American people for the most part
ehh yes like half a bit more than half are from Latin American and after we have from other places
hmm
we have a lot from Asia ,  from China
oh hmm
from from Korea
hmmm
from Thailand ,  I don't know ,  from all part ,  we have some from Haiti
hmm ,  hmm
and from Poland
and have you been teaching for many years ? 
eh I've been teaching for about five years ,  but only two years in this school
aha ,  aha
I mean ,  before I lived in Chile for two years and taught English there
mhm
eh so good they were all Chileans eh
of course ,  of course very good and and in Cuba ,  can you go to Cuba or visit ? 
so I've never ,  I've never gone I think there are ways to go but
no you haven't gone it's difficult no I mean
it's a little difficult you have to you have to go like I mean if one goes directly from the United States one has to go with a purpose like
yes yea
of of medicine or educational ,  clearly
educational ,  right ,  research or things like that
exactly and you can go but you would have to first go to Mexico or Canada
yeah yes yes I know people who have done this ,  m ,  m
or one thing well I would really like is to go I mean I would really like to go with my grandmother who
mhm
who always told me a lot about Cuba but
sure
she already died therefore is not going to happen but
well ,  mm well one of my best friends in Barcelo was this summer almost a month in Cuba
ah look
and the other he was telling me all well that he returned very impacted in other words on one side on how beautiful it was and on the other on how much there's lacking right ? 
mm yes
material things right ?  what's lacking
sure that's what I've heard that it's a beautiful country and that the people there are very nice in other words
mm ,  mm
very loving but
mm
but there's a lot of poverty and lack of things
mm
in other words a lack of resources
mm tomorrow you teach class
what ? 
are you teaching class to the kids tomorrow also ? 
yes well everyday except Saturday and Sunday
and do they also take mobiles take cellular to class yes ? 
yes yes they always said they couldn't have it I mean they can have it in school but they shouldn't have it out in other words they shouldn't
okay
but they always have to watch the time ,  like ,  sometimes they don't wear a watch or they look for the time
hmm ,  hmm hmm
all the same I think that they do this text messaging and these things but I don't really see what is always ,  like
a telephone always ringing in my class
yes well ,  this happens even at the university ,  no ?   That people should ,  I don't know
hmm ,  turn it off ? 
have a bit more realization and in class there's always a mobile that rings
hmm
even though well ,  sometimes it's really easy to forget it ,  no ?   This happened to me in Spain when
hmm
I left my mobile on and then it was very embarrassing when it rings in class and you have to turn it off
yes ,  yes ,  I don't know if my students get embarrassed ,  I think they do it on purpose . 
ah well ,  this is another topic
yes ,  I think that they do it on purpose since they're so popular ans people say look ,  he's fifteen or sixteen and they're his friends
aha
in our same school so they're
yeah
recently arrived immigrants ,  where are they going to find friends elsewhere
hmm sure ,  sure
like the majority must have friends at school so this rings ,  it shouldn't ring because the friend should be in the other class
you can tell him of no sure
eh ,  but it always sounds or the or messages sound I don't know eh
mhm
and they always have er strange sounds I mean one sounds like a cat
yes yes in Spain it is trendy I don't know when an actor becomes popular or some
a ha
some TV character who says some phrase then everybody carries the phrase around on their mobile and and yes yes and I think now in Spain on some trains
they wanted to make carriages for no for immobile people I mean they wanted to ban the use of mobiles on some carriages
hm yes
yes it's really annoying when you're on the bus or
hm
the train is more annoying than two people speaking normal ,  right ?  I mean when
yes because they speak loud ,  I think they speak kind of loud
they speak yes I mean one side loud and on the other like I think because you can't hear the whole conversation you know how one half sounds it's like yes it's as if you
your brain wants to understand the other half right and I don't know I think you get more nervous because of it because you don't quite get what the conversation is about and so I don't know well
right perhaps no also and also I think people speak about more intimate stuff
yes yes yes yes
I mean on the bus one is not going to be talking about something intimate
yes
with someone else but if people call you on the mobile and they don't know where you are and they start talking about something the boyfriend or I don't know what
Yes ,  yes ,  yes
And you kinda start talking and forget that you are in the bus
Yeah ,  you don't notice that they are listening to you ,  it's true
It's fun if people really ,  i don't know ,  i mean ,  they use it like that for
Hello ? 
Hello . 
How are you ? 
Good ,  and you ? 
Good .   My name is ,  I'm from Nebraska . 
Ah .   Hi .   You're with me again . 
We spoke before ,  right ? 
Yes . 
Ah ,  now it's the cell phones . 
Aha .   Now we have to talk about cell phones .   Do you have a cell phone ? 
Yes . 
Me too .   And you drive ? 
Yes .   But ,  well ,  I can't drive and talk at the same time . 
Yes . 
Yes ,  I think that they shouldn't drive like this either . 
Yes ,  I agree .   I think that people ,  ah ,  who have ,  eh ,  a speaker , 
In what ? 
if the cell phone has a speaker , 
Oh ,  yes . 
or ,  or if it has some other ,  hmm ,  method of speaking without having to hold the cell phone in your hand .   But ,  if they have to hold the phone to their ear ,  I ,  I don't think they should be talking . 
yes that´s what I think too . 
you notice that when you are driving behind someone ,  they talk on the cell phone ,  the person does not put attention to the road as they should . 
Yes .  there are many occasions where they almost get out of the road
Mhm . 
Crashed ,  they passed a red light
Mhm ,  Mhm . 
and things like that ,  when they are talking . 
Yes ,  because they can not do two things at a time ,  talk on the cell phone ,  or drive . 
that's right . 
and
and about the movie theaters I don't think they should have the cell phones there . 
Yes ,  I believe people needed to turn it off . 
Mhm . 
Or put it on vibrate ,  but not answer it inside the teather
OK
If you know you are getting a phone call you just step out of the movie teather
Yes ,  because I pay to watch a movie ,  not to hear cell phone tones
Mhm . 
or to hear someone talking on the phone . 
yes . 
Because ,  I don't know ,  if  if you realize ,  but when you're talking on the phone
Aha . 
cell phone ,  they're talking really loud , 
yes ,  yes . 
and everyone can hear what they're saying . 
Yes .   No ,  I think that it's really selfish ,  answering the telephone in the movie theater .   Because , 
Yes . 
it's the same if you were talking really loud in the movie theater , 
Aha . 
And they say that you can't talk so loud ,  well ,  it's the same you can't answer the telephone . 
Yes .   That's what I think too . 
Yes . 
But ,  eh ,  am ,  cell phones are good to have when ,  in case your car breaks down , 
Hmm . 
and no ,  well ,  you're not left ,  without a line or something like this
Hmm . 
You can call so that someone can come and get you . 
Yes .   Yes ,  I think that most people ,  eh ,  use cell phones well .   I think that the problem ,  are mostly the ,  many young people ,  the young kids who have cell phones . 
Aha . 
And who use them ,  it's for ,  it's not ,  in fashion .   It's fashionable and so they want to talk on the cell phone
Yes ,  Aha . 
all the time .  Because ,  they believe they look good talking on the phone . 
Yes . 
Then ,  yes .  But ,  I ,  don't .  I don't agree .  I think they are very good . 
Yes ,  I have a son that
Becau 
is thirteen years old and he already wants a cellular . 
Yes
I told him ,  Are you crazy ? 
Aha ,  Yes ,  yes . 
But ,  is true that all the   all the young kids have them ,  then ,  well ,  they all want it . 
Yes . 
But , 
Yes . 
Not this one . 
Ah yes ,  yes .  That's like that . 
Aha . 
Every time someone has something in school ,  every one wants the same thing . 
Mm .  Also ,  u ,  the bills ,  for long distance ,  with a cellular , 
Ah ,  yes . 
I think they come out cheaper . 
Yes . 
than using the phone in the house . 
Mm ,  yes . 
Ah ,  yes .  We use a lot ,  we use the cellular
Mm . 
for long distance
Mm . 
because it comes out expensive in the house . 
Yes .  Yes ,  that's why ,  ah ,  I bought my cellular ,  when I first bought it ,  because it included calling Puerto Rico . 
Oh . 
Since it's part of the United States , 
Aha . 
well ,  eh ,  it came out free right ?  the minutes that the cellular has ,  that can be used in any part of the United States , 
Aha . 
well ,  I can also use them to ,  to call Puerto Rico . 
Oh . 
Even when I travel there ,  I can ,  still use my cellular . 
Oh ,  that's good . 
Then ,  it was much cheaper
Aha
than ,  than call using the house phone
Then ,  when you call there ,  from here ,  is it like if you are calling abroad ?  Do you get charged for long distance ? 
Well ,  not if you use the cell phone .  If you use the cell phone ,  you are charged like if ,  it depends on the company
Oh
But ,  most of the companies ,  count Puert Rico like if it was another State
Oh
But if you use the house phone ,  you'll be charged more than if tou were calling to another State
Aha
Yes ,  ther is a kind of ,  I mean ,  for Puerto Rico ,  the cost is different that if you were calling any other State
Oh ,  that's good
Yes ,  yes
I wish I had that to call to Mexico
Oh yes
But it's already cheaper ,  calling there ,  also
Mhm
It used to be very expensive ,  but not anymore
Yes ,  well .  There is so many people here ,  that maybe they should do it also for calls to Canada and Mexico ,  it should
be the same cost than calling within the United States .  After all it' all North America .  So ,  it should not be
Yes
it's not that far . 
And ,  you're in Texas ,  Right ? 
Mm . 
And how are the laws there ,  of using the phone when you are driving
I ,  don't think that ,  they've been approved yet . 
Yes ,  I think that here neither . 
No ,  not yet . I think that they were ,  were testing it ,  to see if ,  if they approved it or not ,  but not yet . 
Oh ,  I think that they are also trying to ,  to enact a law ,  but , 
Mm . 
but ,  no ,  You even see the police talking . 
Mm .  Yes .  Yes ,  because ,  the people ,  the people love to answer the cellular wherever they are . 
Yes ? 
I don't like that ,  because is like ,  the people ,  eh ,  they invade your privacy . 
What I don't like ,  neither ,  is when a phone rings ,  and all the people there ,  are looking for their phone ,  to see if
To see whose it is Yes ,  yes . 
aha .  But ,  mm , 
Yes ,  but
it has its benefits ,  and also , 
Mm . 
well ,  it has its errors ,  also . 
Yes ,  yes ,  like everything . 
Ah ,  yes .  That's how it is ,  I too ,  cannot live without my cellular . 
Yes ,  I believe that
I ,  sometimes think ,  how would I do it ?  like the old people ,  you see them ,  and they don't carry them . 
Aha . 
And ,  I start to think ,  how could they have lived before ,  without having one . 
I don't know . 
Because ,  now is like part of life ,  to have one . 
Mm .  Yes ,  yes .  Everything is much easier because
Aha . 
if someone has to come to find ,  or if you have to   even meet in the ,  in the mall with someone . 
Mm . 
One goes to shop to one side ,  and the other goes to shop to the other side ,  and later ,  you can meet with the person much easier . 
Yes . 
Yes ,  everything is made easier . 
Is true .  And ,  now you can send ,  um ,  messages and ,  ah ,  find things on the internet . 
Mm . 
and everything ,  from the phone . 
Yes . 
I remember in ,  when they came out ,  well ,  that of the cellular phones ,  they were those bags ,  a really big bag phone . 
Mm . 
and all of them there carrying their phone bag . 
Yes . 
But , 
Yes ,  they were really big ,  and cost a lot
Yes . 
for the ,  they charged you per minute and it cost a lot . 
Aha .  But ,  how things changed . 
Yes . 
How different they are .  Phones with camera . 
Mm . 
That's what I want . 
Yes . 
One with a camera ,  but ,  I signed a contract , 
Aha . 
and I can't change phones until my contract ends . 
Ah . 
Well ,  I can change it ,  but I have to pay a lot . 
They charge you ,  yes ,  yes . 
Aha .  That's how it is . 
Yes .   But ,  ah another problem with these camera phones is that there aren't even laws that ,  that restrict people putting your communication there and getting the information that you have in your phone . 
oh ,  this is true . 
This is a problem .   Because ,  now ,  they've increased the technology ,  you can do many things from your phone , 
Aha . 
but there still aren't laws that protect you when you're sharing the information that's in your phone . 
Oh ,  it's true . 
Yes ,  So , 
This is another thing too ,  when you're talking on your cell phone , 
Hmm . 
you can never be sure that someone isn't listening to your conversation . 
Yes ,  hmm
Eh ,  and also ,  I don't know ,  one time ,  I went to Los Angeles and my telephone company cut the ca  cut off my phone
Oh ,  really ? 
until I had to call and tell them that I went to Los Angeles .   Because ,  they say at times people can steal your telephone number , 
Hmm . 
and then use it and put a lot of charges on your phone . 
Ah . 
yes ,  well ,  this seemed rare .   I ,  well ,  I don't understand how they do it .   But , 
Hmm . 
it's what they were telling me ,  and they needed to have my permission
Ah .  Aha . 
saying I was over there ,  to connect the phone
That's good ,  that the company did that . 
Yes . 
Yes ,  but , 
But ,  I found it strange ,  I never imagined that someone could do something like that . 
yes ,  yes .  Me neither ,  I didn't know about that ,  yes . 
Mm .  Also ,  I think they should have a law that ,  like ,  those people that call to sell things on the phone , 
Mm . 
you can't find that phone number .  And ,  sometimes ,  in the house ,  a phone in the house ,  people are always calling that want to sell you that ,  sell that . 
Mm . 
And ,  so ,  now the people ,  and ,  and they are getting cellular numbers . 
Mm . 
And ,  they are also doing that .  And ,  I think they have to put a law because ,  uh ,  that's very annoying . 
But ,  you know that you can register your number
Yes ,  but that doesn't , 
so they don't call you
doesn't help that much ,  either .  I put my num 
Yes . 
my name in that list , 
Aha . 
And always received ,  em ,  calls . 
Really ?   Because I ,  since I put my ,  eh ,  ah ,  in the house ,  and the cell phone numbers .   And after about a month and a half ,  I never received another call . 
Yes . 
Never ,  aha . 
Until ,  hmm ,  my grandmother was also receiving a lot of calls ,  so , 
Hmm . 
and she put her name on the list too , 
Hmm . 
and kept calling ,  she doesn't answer the phone . 
Hmm . 
Until the mach  until the machine answers it .   And when she knows who it is , 
Hmm . 
then this is when she answers the phone , 
Hmm . 
because they're bothering her . 
Oh ,  wow . 
Hmm . 
Ah ,  well ,  I don't know if it depends on the state . 
Perhaps . 
Because since I got mine ,  I took about forty days ,  I then I never received a phone call again
That is great . 
Mhm . 
No .  because that people likes to bother a lot . 
Yes ,  Because I have a house phone . 
Ok . 
I have caller ID ,  I just have it just in case I have to call nine ,  one ,  one or something like that . 
Oh ,  Okay
Hello ? 
Hello ,  How is it going ? 
How are you ?  Mercedes' speaking . 
Hello ,  I'm Pilar . 
Pilar ,  we've already talked before . 
Ah ,  yes .  Is true . 
yes .  Ah ,  well ,  I didn't understand the topic well . 
They take little . 
Ah ,  my God . 
I don't know what about dating ,  dating .  What's that ?  what was it telling you ? 
Darting .  Could it be darting how ? 
Darting ,  ah . 
I thought that perhaps it was like date ,  but they haven't
yes . 
really ? 
It said something about ,  about , u ,  Um ,  placing ads ,  or something like that . 
I imagine is like online dating .  Right ? 
yes ,  yes ,  something like that . 
Let's discuss that ,  and if it's not ,  let them tell us . 
that the person that explains the topic ,  should speak more clearly next time ,  because ,  the truth , 
yes
has a pretty strange accent . 
yes ,  yes . 
Well ,  let's see ,  have you ever ,  ever ,  did blind dating ,  or ,  or over the internet ? 
Mm ,  no .  I've never participated in that .  But ,  yes I have known people that have .  Also ,  I've even know people that got married with a person that they met that way . 
Me neither .  Oh really ? 
yes .  And ,  they've spent years married since . 
And ,  why did they look on the internet ,  or ,  or how ? 
Because they didn't ,  eh ,  weren't having luck you know ,  when they were going out to the bars ,  they ,  also they had joined ,  for example ,  clubs ,  and
they didn't meet ,  or the peop  ,  they weren't meet people ,  or the people that they were meeting they weren't liking .  So then ,  like that is ,  usually ,  a huge database of information ,  a ton of people . 
yes . 
and that's how ,  am they meet . 
You always find someone . 
yes .  And ,  that ,  eh ,  I have known people that in the same city ,  right ?  They got to know each other that way . 
Ah ,  yes . 
Or you know ,  that was just the first contact ,  and later ,  they ,  they meet each other in person and they started going out . 
Mhm . 
Or you know ,  maybe it's just not only that ,  but you know ,  initial contact ,  and then afterwards they start to get to know each other as people and they start dating .  But ,  also I've know people that , 
umm ,  in the different countries . 
Ah ,  yes .  And did they end up together ? 
yes ,  yes ,  it
That that is difficult . 
yes ,  yes .  It is true ,  he was here in the United States ,  and she was in Ecuador ,  and they met on a website that is called amigos . com ,  something like that . 
And they met ,  and they knew each other ,  he went to see her ,  and after that ,  he took her ,  and they got married here . 
How fast .  Because a relationship in another country ,  is always difficult because there is not enough time to know well the other person ,  like to know if it is worth to move to another country . 
yes ,  I think the same .  I think that I don´t ,  well ,  I could not do . 
yes ,  yes . 
I ,  maybe ,  like I said before ,  eh ,  What did I said ?  to know the person .  Because ,  it is a good ,  is another way of meeting people .  But , 
yes .  Of course ,  if you know someone and you don´t like him ,  well .  You don´t go out with him anymore ,  and that is all . 
yes . 
yes ,  is like to know somebody at a bar ,  really ,  you don´t know that person ,  and you meet him ,  and you start to talk .  Right ? 
Aha . 
That is ,  the other way ,  yes ,  yes .  I agree with you . 
but I could try it now ,  so . 
But ,  lets see , 
I ,  right now ,  I am married .  So ,  right now I think I , 
yes . 
I don´t think so ,  I am never going to need to use it .  Eh ,  are you single Right ? 
No ,  I am married too ,  yes . 
No .  Ah ,  Are you married too ?  Maybe ,  ah ,  no .  I don´t think I ,  I don´t think I would use it .  Well ,  at first ,  I will not have the need
Here ,  what's in ,  is something called speed dating ,  have you heard about speed dating ? 
I've read articles about it ,  but I have never ,  well , 
Well ,  I don't know ,  I may join a club
Mhm
Spaniards club ,  here in New York , 
Mhm
they organize plenty of activities .   They are talking about organizing a speed dating ,  but not a serious one where people really seek
for couple ,  but just for fun ,  because it seems to be very funny . 
Mhm
Then ,  I think I will join in .  It's supposed to be like girls sitting around a table ,  or some tables ,  all the girls sitting
and there is a clock or something like this showing the time ,  when time starts ,  men sit next to the woman who is in their turn , 
Mhm
and they have two minutes to talk
And this one they are going to organize would only be for Spaniards ? 
Well ,  I think their idea is to get together Spaniards and foreigners
Oh
You know ,  make groups among Spaniards and foreigners ,  that want to meet them ,  and the Spaniards and foreigners who maybe want
And ,  then ,  after the two minutes ,  you change to the next person .  And so on ,  until they have all met each other
Mhm
And afterwards ,  at the end ,  when you are about to leave ,  well ,  you note down who you like and who you don't like ,  and you give it to
to the agency .  The ,  they send you the contact data of that person , 
Mhm
if that person also noted down she was interested in you .  On  only in that case .  If they both note down they are interested ,  then they are sent the contact data
Mm .  Two thing about that .  One ,  I find it like very pressing ,  right ? 
yes ,  a big pressure ,  two minutes
well ,  yes .  Pressure on ,  saying the right phrase ,  right ?  in those two minutes ,  and give a good impression .  And the other
yes
if you don't get any contact ,  I guess you'll feel bad
You get depressed ,  yes ,  that's right .  But ,  what actually happens is that men note down all of the women ,  right ?  Then ,  it's enough if one women chooses him
and so ,  they are happy like that
yes ,  yes .  But I would get depressed if nobody called me
yes ,  yes .  But ,  well ,  that depends on how ,  on how seriously you take it
Mhm
If you it a little bit for fun ,  well .  . 
Mhm
there is no problem .  But ,  if it's your last option and you don't know what else you can do ,  then I guess so . 
I don't know ,  if I say that these new ways of ,  these ,  I mean ,  via e mail and things like this ,  it's not that new ,  right ?  But this speed dating , 
yes
I don't know ,  I find it too much pressure
yes ,  ell ,  on the other side ,  with just two minutes ,  you don't have the time to give a bad impression
Yes ,  but ,  but
Not good or bad
But ,  the other thing ,  is also that in 2 minutes ,  is the only one that can evaluate is more than else physic
Really ? 
Yes
I mean ,  if I like that person ,  i fell that maybe there is a good initial connection
Yes ,  sure .  Because I think that the idea of Speed dating is like a bar where everybody has the chance ,  with everyone ,  but you know you have only 2 minutes .  So
Mmm
If you really don't like someone ,  or you don't stand him ,  you know he will be away in 2 minutes
yes
And you won't see him anymore ,  I think that's the idea ,  I guess
Wow ,  But creating that kind of impression ,  you don't like someone in just two minutes
No ,  but I don't know .  In a bar ,  it always gets near ,  the typical guy
Oh yes
in the bar ,  and two minutes seems like an eternity ,  and
It's true
And there is no limit ,  he can stay there talking with you all night
That's true
Then ,  there ,  at least you save that .  If you don't like it ,  well ,  after a minute ,  is over .  But I found him ,  funny ,  and organize this ,  I would go
Because ,  well ,  I tell you ,  it's like a game ,  right ?  .  The idea is not getting a date ,  I don't need a date right now
Ah ,  who knows ,  Perhaps ,  he'll get lucky . 
yes ,  yes . 
There are those that find a partner from that ,  yes .  Mm ,  you never know . 
There's always ,  everywhere ,  always ,  the people always find love
Mm . 
in the strangest ways .  But ,  anyways ,  to me ,  that of putting ads ,  eh ,  of putting ads in a newspaper , 
Mm . 
What do you think of that ? 
No
Or ,  or in those places of ,  of , 
I know . 
of ,  putting couples together in a plan ,  looking for a woman that I don't know what ,  I don't know . 
I don't know .  The truth ,  eh ,  because ,  in theory ,  is not very different to all this .  Right ?  But ,  I've always had a little bit of distrust for those ads . 
yes . 
It seems to me . 
yes ,  to me always ,  that's always scared me a lot .  Because ,  you never know ,  the other person ,  what type of person is going to be .  And ,  mm , 
I always have the impression ,  that the people ,  that perhaps its' a prejudice ,  maybe they are false ,  the people that do those things ,  are people a little , 
the strange people ,  and the people that devote themselves to things
And ,  that's why I say ,  in theory ,  is the same as by the internet .  Right ?  Because ,  yes ,  let's say ,  in match dot com , 
yes . 
basically ,  how many times they say ,  I'm looking for a woman ,  but I'm like this and like that ,  right ? 
yes . 
contact me . 
Well ,  I think that the difference is that ,  on the internet ,  people ,  they use the internet a lot , 
Hmm . 
and  and many normal people , 
Hmm . 
get on and do it and get to know each other .   So ,  the other ,  traditionally ,  I think that it was more rare for people to do it . 
And ,  I don't know ,  I don't know . 
Yes .   Eh ,  yes ,  eh ,  and it's also ,  hmm ,  the ,  the other too ,  the other method ,  also ,  was in the chat rooms .   Right ? 
yes . 
Only ,  this ,  maybe ,  eh ,  would be a bit more ,  eh ,  aggressive ,  quicker to meet someone .   Because ,  immediately ,  you can start talking with the person ,  so . 
So ,  if one leaves and one enters the room ,  and
Hmm .   But ,  then ,  it's ,  people lie a lot in the chat rooms . 
yes ,  this is also huge . 
There are ,  there are many women who say they're men ,  men who say they're women ,  and they send photos that aren't of them , 
But ,  the same would happen on e mail .   It's the same situation . 
yes ,  but it all depends on ,  on ,  like in a chat ,  there are many people who are only there to have fun .   But ,  in ,  in ,  on one of these sites , 
like match . com or what's it called , 
Hmm . 
I suppose that ,  that you have to get registered , 
yes
You have to give your data ,  And ,  people that do it ,  in truth ,  it's people that ,  in general ,  want to find a partner . 
yes . 
They don't want to just be entertained for a while .  For that reason ,  that ,  I say it's more serious .  And there are fewer possibilities of ,  that it might be ,  ah ,  someone who just wants to have fun ,  or is not doing it seriously ,  or is lying . 
Mm . 
But in the chats ,  it's very easy to say you are another person ,  eh ,  that you are a super fantastic girl or guy .  And ,  and on the other hand ,  wants to date you . 
yes
And ,  it's all a lie . 
Yes ,  that's very true .  Because Match . com ,  people have to pay .  This is because ,  at least ,  there is something that is ,  mm
No ? 
Of course ,  and that is ,  eh ,  eh ,  makes it so those who don't have intentions
Good ,  that are good
good ,  in general ,  well then ,  won't ,  they won't bother
yes
yes
Also ,  another ,  also ,  that I use a lot ,  is Craigslist .  I don't know if any ,  and I've also seen that it also has ,  eh ,  like it has classifications ,  right ?  ,  where they put , 
yes
They also have a dating area
So then it's like a newspaper .  For me ,  it's like the classifieds in the newspaper ,  but on the Internet .  So then ,  there I also ,  But ,  well ,  I ,  I have been without a partner for a long time , 
Uh huh . 
and I didn't k  I didn't know how to meet someone because I had my group of friends ,  that I'd known all my life ,  I'd always go to the same places , 
Mhm . 
and I didn't have ,  and ,  and every time I'd try to do some kind of new activity ,  I couldn't meet anyone .  And ,  it never occurred to me ,  never ,  it never occurred to me to do that ,  never . 
Right in Spain ,  it also depends on the country .  Maybe ,  here ,  it's more widespread .  In Spain ,  really ,  the only people who did it ,  like ,  older people or weird people ,  people who were looking for
Hello ? 
Hi ,  my name is Milde Marcela and I live in Connecticut
Oh ,  I am ,  I am ,  my name is Audria and I live in Atlanta ,  Georgia
Oh
Did you understand today's subject ? 
It's about Internet ,  ah ,  meeting people in the Internet
Oh ,  OK
Aha
That's more or less what I understood ,  but since the record was a little I don't know ,  I didn't understand it very well
yes ,  the question is if you think that ,  that you have ever met someone this way ,  and ,  oh ,  I mean ,  if you have ever used the services and if you think it is possible to meet someone in the
in the Internet
in the Internet .  I don't think so ,  because I don't like it ,  I'm scared of it .  I think there are a lot of crazy people ,  I have seen cases on the TV ,  so ,  so
of women who have met a man in the Internet and when they have gone out together ,  they have been robbed ,  abused ,  or killed
so ,  I don't use it .  I'm scared of it already .  Besides I'm too old for that ,  that's for crazy young girls ,  young girls . 
well I understand it perfectly because I think just like you about meeting someone to be your couple .  To me a relationship ,  well ,  should be something natural ,  meeting someone and having something in common
but not searching in the Internet
aha ,  aha .  It's like ,  like if you are selling yourself ,  selling your services or searching for something that is not real ,  because they even sometimes send pictures
of themselves saying how they are and when you really get to know them ,  well I've heard that it's not like that ,  it's not the same person
yes
not even the same body you were shown
any  eh right .  But to me that ,  if it's about ,  like I told you ,  if it's about couple or finding the love of your lifetime ,  then
in the picture
if it's fot yourself ,  you find it along the way
Yes uhum
You don't have to look for it ,  and if it's not for you ,  you know ,  you just can't help it
Yes .  There are many couples who met in the Internet ,  they got married a few months later and have lasted many years together
but now ,  the way things are now ,  with so many problems ,  You live with a little more fear
yes
Maybe in the beginning ,  I think it was a little bit safer ,  but now you are  somehow more reluctant to ,  you know ,  to open to these realtionships
yes
At least I am ,  I don't know ,  my daughters use the Internet and send
Well ,  I use Internet a lot .  And through Internet I've met some old friends of mine from school ,  from University
Aha .  Ah
even last year ,  I met a friend I used to have when I was twelve years old
Oh yes
yes ,  and i got to know about her life and so ,  but relationships ,  that is what I don't like
That's for ,  ah ,  I think it's good to find your old friends from school ,  things about your family ,  reaching some relatives you haven't seen in a long time ,  and you may find them
I think the Internet is good for presenting your services .  But not for couple matters ,  not in my opinion ,  no
Other people do ,  I know it may work ,  because I've heard of many cases in which it did work ,  you know what I mean ? 
yes
But ,  I don't know
Besides ,  I guess it has a lot to do with which service you use to find a mate ,  because there are some services where you pay and they do
they don't let everybody join
Aha ,  aha ,  yes now they even sell wives in the Internet ,  specially oriental women
Oh ,  my goodness
There are many which ,  which the American buy in the Internet and ,  you know ,  they pay some money supposedly to pay for the visa
They have to pay for all the expenses ,  airport taxes ,  passage ,  all that ,  and they get women ,  and most of them are very happy with the women because it's said that oriental women are very ,  how is it ?  very devoted to her man
yes
I think it does work sometimes ,  not always .  And the one who uses it ,  must be very careful ,  but for this matters of family or friendships
Because some of them ,  I think although I have never been in one of this chatrooms ,  but ,  uh ,  to caht with anyone ,  nut I
I don't know ,  if this way you can make good friends ,  I mean just through Internet ,  without any personal relation ,  you know
yes ,  I have a girlfriend who has met many people this way ,  in the chat rooms
Aha
She maintains relations with them ,  friendship relations ,  long distance ,  via email
Friendship ,  aha ,  that I think would be fine .  Aha ,  aha ,  I think it's fantastic this way
But ,  to me ,  I don't find it that easy ,  I don't know ,  I think that ,  mm ,  for these matters I am very res  ,  I think I am more reserved than she is ,  I don't feel comfortable in these situations
Uhum ,  yes .  To be confident to someone you have met this way ,  sometimes I think it's because you swap ,  I mean ,  culture ,  you swap opinions .  My sister communicates with
um ,  with other persons who share receipts from different countries .  And she
yes
But I have never shared on the computer ,  I have never used it that way
Maybe you are more like me ,  a little more reserved about this subjects
No ,  I am older already .  I am fifty six years old ,  so I am not much into it ,  I only use the Internet for
I mean ,  for professional matters ,  houses information for buying and selling and this kind of things
yes
dictionary to write a letter .  But to chat or look for a couple ,  no ,  no ,  no way ,  I don't even know how to
yes ,  me too .  I look for receipts in websites ,  but not friendships .  No ,  I have never tried to do it ,  and I have no interest in doing it either
aha ,  yes ,  To me ,  to me
It may also have something to do with my time limitations .  I am single ,  I have a four years old daughter ,  and she and my job together
aha
don't leave free time enough to
aha
find and maintain such a friendship
Aha .  Aha ,  well ,  I know many couples who have met in the Internet ,  and they get along pretty well ,  but I also think ,  on the other side , 
that it has been used by many people to be ,  how you call it ?  ,  to be unfaithful to their partner
yes
because they fall in love to this women in the Internet ,  and sometimes destroys .  I have some friends of mine whose families have been destroyed because the husbands spent
all their time in the Internet ,  and then ,  when they get home the husbands change the screen ,  you know ,  until they started looking for and have found
yes
the conversations they hold with other women ,  so ,  I think it's suitable for many things .  You know what I mean ?  I myself ,  find it very productive
yes
Oh ,  let's see ,  how would I say this ?  ,  the last in personal relation ,  because has a lot of ,  yes exactly
Negative same as positive
No ,  you have many ,  you know ,  websites where you go and get a partner in different sites ,  because there are for men with men or women with women ,  also for
elder people ,  and younger people ,  you know ,  and I also don't like the issue of kids ,  I have realized how they can
yes
and getting to know little girls .  Here in Connecticut ,  was a case of a men ,  from New Jersey I think and he was involved with someone in the internet saying he was a young boy
that was younger and they guy was 45 years old and the girl like 15 years old
yes ,  that's dangerous
So ,  he tried to convince her until he took her and now he is in jail because they were able to pick him there and
At least they were able to jail him ,  because I've heard cases where they weren't able to pick him ,  and after they find the girl or the boy dead
yes ,  and that's why I don't like that for personal relationships ,  I don' trust it ,  maybe for other people ,  that is right ,  but not for me
No
For me ,  it's like it doesn't work
That's true ,  I think as you because I'm not that into it ,  I used a little bit ,  as you said
informative stuff ,  exactly
informative ,  yes and
But ,  young people also ,  in the internet ,  well ,  I think that is not healthy either
No ,  no ,  how is it ?  ,  and after ,  people is saying , I'm bored ,  I'm bored but they don anything ,  sitting all day in front of a computer
Exactly
Yes ,  that they are bored ,  no things to do and there are so many things they can do at home ,  but ,  everything is so
conversations with friend in the computer ,  and sometimes they don't even do their homework .  Because of being in the Internet talking with others
yes
of their age ,  or those who pretend to be of their age ,  that also exist .  They cheat them ,  and when they go to meet them ,  specially the girls
they are ,  you know ,  I don't like it .  I don't like that part of the service
No .  No ,  no but I think that is also related to the parents ,  because they shouldn't allow them to act like that ,  you know ,  in the chat rooms and so because you can never be sure of whom you are talking to in a chat room
Aha ,  aha ,  yes ,  there twenty thousand impostors and you think it is a kind of person ,  how can I tell you ?  I have a friend of mine that the guy took everything she had ,  she even lost her house
Wow
because she felt in love with him ,  they married ,  she cheated her so well that she changed the account to his name because he was supposed to be a guy who
had a businesses and so .  And then he made her do some investments ,  changing all her properties to his name
And he left her in the street
Wow
He took all she had .  And she can't do anything because she had already signed ,  and everything was on his name .  What can she do ?  Nothing ,  she couldn't do nothing
yes  , yes
Oh
Something like this happened to a friend of mine at work ,  his best friend whom I also know ,  met someone in the Internet .  He married her
He brought her here ,  from Georgia .  And now he is divorced and she took everything .  He lost the house ,  he is living in an apartment and almost has no money
Oh ,  poor guy .  That's what I was saying ,  they don't know where they
Hello

Happy with the program ?  In calling . 
And yes ,  yes ,  you know what happens ,  is that ,  he of the ,  of the ,  the ,  the automatic answering machine ,  speaks horrible Spanish . 
Right is true , I didn't understand
It's a horrible Spanish .  I have to try to deduce what it says . 
And I see that ,  that also I didn't even understand the first word today .  What's ,  what is the topic ,  he said ,  calls ? 
To 
Is something
I didn't understand either .  I think it was I think it was something about meeting people
By Internet
online by Internet seems to me . 
Eh ,  yes ,  yes
Because at the end says yes ,  that it does seem like a good way to meet a per  people ,  and
Exact 
but I'm not sure

What a horror

Ah yes
So ,  this well it also made me decide to ,  to come you know . 
It's funny ,  yes ,  to come to Philadelphia ,  because
Yes
many people goes to Florida ,  or states more ,  well ,  with good Universities
Sure ,  Sure .  I look ,  well ,  I have ,  I don't know if you know it ,  this Spanish Bank called Bacasha ,  a Catalan Bank that is a savings bank
Mmm ,  yes
Well ,  it turns out that Bacasha dedicates part of their money ,  part of the benefits to give scholarships
Oh
To Study in the United States
That's wonderful
Graduate scholarships ,  and then ,  I got one of those scholarships ,  you know
Oh ,  congratulations
Thank you ,  then ,  well ,  after getting the scholarship ,  they asked my to apply for the university I wanted ,  and they will paid it
And they paid ,  They pay for 2 years ,  The Doctorate program

I got in Penn ,  Oh ,  that's wonderful ,  I
Is really nice
I wanted to get there for a Graduate program and they sent me back home
Really ? well
because you have to be summa cum laude ,  I think to be accepted
Yes ,  the truth is it's really difficult ,  it's really difficult to get in .   I
Hmm
I ,  and then it's really hard ,  like ,  you don't start here with getting in and you've done everything ,  it's the opposite ,  it's when you begin to suffer
Ayeayeaye
Because the program is really really hard
It's not worth it ,  make the calls that I like more ,  asking yourself more things ,  because I know that time is running out . 
I think ,  I think that yes ,  the telephones are worth it . 
Ah ,  well take down mine .   Do you have a pencil ? 
Why not .   Yes ,  sure , 
If you want ,  two ,  fifteen ,  aha ,  seven ,  twenty two
two fifteen ,  two fifteen seven twenty two , 
thirty seven ,  zero three
thirty seven ,  zero three . 
This is the house ,  so here I am at the order . 
Ok ,  I'm going to give you the ,  the cell ,  well no ,  I don't know if it's the cell ,  I call it mobile
Aha
Ok ,  it's two fifteen ,

Aha ,  but I thought I heard you mentioned your cellphone ,  no ?  To the cellphone ? 
No ,  Mi   mi   mi Miguel Angel
yes ,  no ,  no ,  no
I see
But it's two fifteen right ? 
It's two fifteen ,  yes ,  from Philadelphia ,  it's a cellphone from Cingular
I believe that it's valid because I believe that the whole point is to connect people ,  so that they talk and they ask each other questions . 
Ah ,  of course it's valid .  Well if I ,  I think that this people wants to have conversations I mean ,  listen to conversations in ,  in Spanish . 
How much would they be without
The
I ,  not yet
I can see that ,  I think that they need to analyze how people get to know each other ,  through ,  the telephone . 
Ah
But since the people ,  I mean ,  the people don't know each other through a phone ,  if they can't personally meet ,  you know . 
Sure ,  ah ,  but
I believe that
because there's still like twenty minutes until we can talk about the other topic of
Ah ,  yes . 
of ,  of the Internet ,  because that other chapter no . 
Yes
But not us ,  no no no no ,  that
I don't know ,  anyways ,  do you use the Internet ? 
I don't know .  Yes of course .  I have email
Aha Aha Well ,  me too ,  and ,  and ,  honestly yes ,  when I use the Internet
You do meet them but
Yes
today ,  well many  I still have friends from the year two thousand one that I started to
Hm mm
see some people in in what they called communities ,  and that
Hm mm
and I stayed with friends but very little really . 
Yes ,  man ,  well sure ,  is hard ,  but ,  look I'll tell you that Here ,  in the United States not yet ,  because I haven't had a lot of time sure ,  but in Spain I ,  many of my friends ,  I made them through the Internet eh
Ah well how nice  yes because over there is more like
Yes
open ,  over there there's more openness right . 
Yes ,  that is ,  it's more ,  I don't know ,  I see ,  many friends ,  but people from Madrid ,  you know ,  but since Madrid is so big , 
Hm
So there are people that would never ,  that would never have met if it wasn't for the Internet . 
Yes . 
People who live in different neighborhoods of the city . 
How is the
People ,  well ,  no ,  well ,  well ,  like you ,  well it's like you have guessed .  Well ,  I don't know ,  you don't ask me
Because always I remember very much ,  and the

Ah ,  marvelous Marvel . 
They still are going out even if they stay there ,  true ? 
Yes ,  marvelous ,  marvelous ,  Well ,  I

It's been now three months that I'm not ,  or at least when I return ,  I'm surprised to see how much it has changed ,  but going
when I left
Are you going to go during Christmas or something like that ? 
Yes ,  previous Christmases I didn't go .  I stayed here . 
okay . 
But they were my first Christmases outside of Spain ,  and I spent them badly ,  but well ,  you know what I mean ,  you are a psychologist
Hm ,  hm . 
I passed it bad ,  but I didn't want ,  I didn't want to go to Madrid . 
You wanted to see here ,  how it was . 
Because you knew that yes because if it is  yeah ,  because no ,  no ,  because ,  no ,  I did it because i  if I went to Madrid ,  I was going to have left . 
Oh ,  already ,  yes ,  it was like discipline
Because it was very Clearly
A dis 
Because ,  it was it was still very bad here Because she had not tied me ,  because she didn't know practically anybody
Oh Yes yes
Because ,  you know I wasn't well ,  and she didn't do more than decide Madrid for me ,  and very badly .  Then I thought ,  as it goes for me in Christmas is ,  you will already see . 
Jeez

Simply ,  well ,  we bought some food on the mall ,  we did a little ham we had ,  my mom smuggled us
Yeah ,  that's good
Spanish serrano ham
Serrano ham
Spanish serrano ham ,  which is a ,  it's a ,  it's divine ,  it's a delight
Oh ,  we don't have that here ,  not here
No ,  there's ,  the nearest thing is the prosciutto ,  it's Italian
Uh ,  yeah ,  but
But ,  come on ,  nothing like that
Uh
Nothing like the Spanish serrano ham
Oh really ? 
And
Hello
Hello
yes ,  who am I talking to ? 
eh ,  Michael and who is this ? 
eh ,  I'm Silvia ,  I'm in Philadelphia and you ? 
ah ,  Silvia ,  I'm also in Philadelphia
oh ,  that's cool ,  cool . 
yes ,  eh ,  which is the ,  which is the ? 
Look
Today's subject is ,  I don't understand what this guy is saying . 
yes ,  you see ,  he just made a huge mistake ,  eh ,  he just said ,  today's holiday is dates ,  say in which dates
yes ,  that's what I heard but then he started speaking about the Internet . 
are better ,  and ,  the services in which people get together in the Internet ,  and then I realized ,  that's why I'm saying he just made
yes ,  yes
a ,  a huge mistake ,  I just realized that they looked for date in the dictionary and that's where they came up with date day . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes
This first study should be
typical
they should speak a better Spanish ,  don't you think ? 
yes ,  sure ,  which ,  what do you want to talk about then
Well they say that ,  that we talk about the services
dating services no
of ,  of meeting people ,  meeting people on the Internet
you ,  you use these services ,  you already used them
No ,  I have some friends who have used them ,  and ,  eh I have one that ,  who has a phobia . 
yes
and she said I know what the phobia is ,  but I can't control the phobia
if these are a service ,  like romantic services or more something to get together with friends you already know ,  or something like this
no ,  I think that it's only for the more romantic level . 
Romantic ,  no .   No ,  this seems really strange to me ,  you go to the internet to meet a par  ,  romantic ,  this I don't know ,  it kind of scares me
Look what happens ,  I understand the logic .   that the women aren't meeting single guys
yes
They're not surrounded by them and they don't ask them out and because of this they have to go on a service that simply
would be because all the men I know are always finding themselves with uncompromising women
an yes ,  it's tru  I keep myself from
yes
talking about certain things with a man because the ,  the perspectives are really different . 
yes ,  completely different
umm ,  I see a really good thing in these services ,  from my perspective as a woman . 
yes
that ,  that it's not going to be the perspective of a man . 
yes
I feel that women ,  they have to put up with men
yes
so ,  in the beginning ,  everything is so nice ,  wonderful and they take her out and then they feel
that they've won you over and then they start treating you like a rag
yes
and
yes
and that's one thing ,  I know that any man would say ,  no ,  it's not like that ,  they have their own versions
yes ,  I do have to admit that is the truth
ah ,  ah
that happens ,  but that's natural ,  it's like instinct after the conquest
mhm
when you are already ,  conquered ,  then
yes
it kind of looses the thrill ,  or the
yea ,  and there are killer instincts . 
yes
eh ,  so ,  so ,  in a situation like that I think that women should send him to hell ,  because where ,  where she got him ,  there are ten thousand others waiting
yes of course ,  is the same ,  the women have to ,  they have to stand up to the man and not let themselves be treated like that . 
Well that would be good really . 
yes
And something else I see ,  like I say it's hard for women to meet single men and when they meet one and he shows interest
many times they hang on to him because ,  they think ,  perhaps it will be three years before I find another one . 
yes
And that's not ,  that's not good ,  for him ,  nor her .  Because he wants someone ,  who feels love for him .  Not to the level ,  of this is the last train in the station
yes
And ,  and a ,  relationship based on that cannot work
yes but do you think that a relationship based on a computer service where one puts I don't know ,  I don't even know what type of information
they ask you ,  but ,  I don't think it can be too ,  eh ,  too detailed .  oh ,  deep ,  no . 
They are coming out
I don't know how ,  they find the person . 
You know as far as that ,  it's becoming more popular ,  and they are becoming more popular more services of all kinds are coming out , 
yes
there are the services ,  on a superficial level
yes
eh ,  but there are services where one pays a lot and where the person has to do all types of tests and where they even do um police investigations ,  police investigations
yes
to see ,  to see things like if there's a criminal record or the person is married . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  you eh ,  did you see the television commercials from e harmony
yes ,  I have some friends
eh yes
coincidentally ,  coincidentally would come and tell me that their son ,  who was thirty years old and unmarried ,  not married
yes
and they had heard about the guy that founded e harmony
yes
and they would tell him to check e harmony out ,  join e harmony and then the guy joined and he met a girl and they got married and they are going to have a baby
Really ? 
yes
that's amazing . 
yes ,  I mean ,  I've heard that
yes ,  well ,  so
there's a lot of diversity between the services and sometimes ,  those services are pretty serious
yes ,  yes ,  this e harmony seems serious ,  really
um and one of my friends ,  she says she's afraid ,  she told me that she goes to a bar or somewhere else and you go out to see if you meet someone . 
it's  just as anonymous
yes
The contact ,  you don't know anything about , 
and it's the same kind of danger too ,  it's not like
this is
you go to a bar it's ,  it's super safe ,  it's more dangerous to go to a bar , 
hmm ,  hmm
than ,  than entering a service ,  maybe ,  no
yes she told me ,  I understand and ,  for her ,  maybe not to bars but to places to dance and that
she told me ,  I understand that it's my phobia because it doesn't bother me to meet someone in a place where you dance . 
yes
and and it bo  it scares me to meet someone through an internet service and I understand it's illogical on my part . 
yes but there has to be a reason for ,  for this fear ,  i think it's the impersonality of the medium
Look ,  I think it is
this
that you're scared of the unknown . 
this
and ,  and ,  going to a place to dance and dancing with something .   She's used to doing it
yes ,  or like with friends sometimes ,  not ,  not alone
yeah this yes ,  and she's familiar with the internet ,  she's not used to doing it ,  and it scares her . 
Yes ,  and it's something that you do along ,  it's not a social process . 
yes ,  do alone ,  hmm
it's a big difference
hmm ,  hmm
yes
But I've talked to some men who have told me that they have used it and ,  those services and I tell them and Why ? 
yes
And they tell me ,  because in my daily life ,  I don't meet women with whom I'd like to go out ,  I meet women and all that ,  but none catch my attention
yes ,  yes ,  and that happens ,  that
so even the men , 
yes that happens a lot I ,  my sister has an ,  an account in a one of those types of sites but is not
aha
Is not romantic so then is where one finds friends and ,  you put there the list of your friends and they put their pictures and that
mm ,  mm
but this site that's called my space now started having a romantic section also and
mm
just young people ,  from from twelve years old until twenty one come out there meeting each other
That's not good ,  that's not healthy ,  no
eh ,  that ,  that's like dangerous ,  because one
that ,  yes mm
there can be a guy that enters there a perverted fifty year old
totally ,  yes ,  totally
that he gets there puts whatever name ,  a little girl or something talking with him
yes
I don't know this had to have an age limit . 
This yes ,  I'm ,  yes ,  Exactly ,  this yes ,  and has ,  and yes ,  has to be between adults ,  for young people ,  the enormous danger ,  yes
yes yes ,  sure . 
And ,  and yes ,  if someone doesn't do it ,  they send them to something like harmony where ,  according to my friends ,  they really investigate people . 
yes yes yes ,  you need to because if not it's not useful
yes yes yes and you ,  you're single or married . 
well I'm single ,  on paper ,  but practically married . 
ah ,  you have a girlfriend
yes ,  for a long time now
ah ,  how nice ,  great . 
yes
and what country are you from ,  it's
I'm part Colombian part Brazilian and part American
ah , 
I lived in Brazil for many years ,  I lived in Colombia and now I've been in Philadelphia for five
um ,  and what do you do in Philadelphia ? 
eh ,  I studied at Penn
um
and I graduated ,  I'm working now
ah ,  so you stayed there ,  you stayed there in Philadelphia . 
yes ,  I stayed .   Are you at Penn ? 
No ,  no I have a son at Penn

yes ,  he's a junior
ah nice ,  and what country are you from ? 
uh ,  from Cuba

ah ,  I'm not in favor of this ,  I would like to be ,  I would like to be in Cuba ,  and you ,  what country are your mom and dad from ? 
um ,  um how interesting
so yes ,  it's strange ,  always ,  eh ,  speaking different languages ,  I speak English with my mom ,  Spanish with my dad ,  and Portuguese with my brothers
ah how interesting
yes ,  yes it's different
hum
How are you ? 
Eh ,  good And you ? 
Ah ,  here more or less here with the kids . 
mm
I want to put to sleep .  Where are you calling from ?  From where are you calling ? 
What ?  I'm in New York . 
ah ,  okay
And you ? 
Ah I'm here in Georgia ,  I'm Norma . 
Ah , 
Here Georgia ,  in Atlanta ,  Georgia . 
Look , 
And ah ,  you know that I didn't understand too much what the topic was about .  Did you understand it ? 
yes
Of what ? 
Well is that they say dates ,  but I think it has to do with dates .  In other words
Ah ,  okay ,  okay
I mean ,  of going out ,  of looking for romance on the internet . 
Ah ,  okay I was thinking
In other words they said dates ,  like ,  like the question is translated directly from English and they say ,  say dates
so ,  this man didn't speak Spanish very well . 
No it's like a machine ,  it's like a computer that's talking . 
yes ,  it speaks bad ,  really badly . 
And where are you from ? 
Ah ,  I'm Peruvian ,  and you ? 
eh ,  I'm from here in New York ,  my parents are Cuban .   Eh ,  well ,  I don't know ,  what do you think of dates on the internet and these kinds of things
Well ,  I don't know ,  the truth is that for me ,  it's better to contact people directly ,  to make a date as they say .   With ,  with the person ,  no ,  it would be better . 
hmm
Even if ,  there are options ,  for people for example who like to do this ,  you know ,  these kinds of dates ,  there are people who like to do this . 
Sure . 
Sure ,  like there's a mystery ,  you don't know how this person is . 
What ? 
Like it's a mystery ,  no ,  they like the mystery .   Of not knowing ,  surprising themselves this way
Sure , 
A question like this ,  I don't know but the truth in my case ,  I don't really agree with this . 
Sure .   hmm
No .   And how is it for you ,  what do you think ? 
It doesn't bother me much ,  I don't know it's like ,  today I think that many ,  like before I think that people were like , 
missed what they had ,  like people who couldn't find people any other way . 
Ah ,  yes . 
But now ,  at least here in New York ,  I know many people
Mmm
what do ,  as a way to find someone
Of finding ,  yes ,  finding
because sometimes
A lover
I mean ,  sometimes is hard to find someone
yes
So ,  for example ,  I'm a teacher ,  and in my work ,  almost all of them are women .  I mean ,  finding someone
Yes
Trough work ,  it's going to be hard
Well ,  yes ,  there are
So ,  then ,  like a way of knowing people ,  you have to be careful
Yes ,  because ,  in sometimes ,  specially minors
Because
They haven't being sexually harassed ,  by predators ,  like they are called ,  sure ,  that
Oh ,  sure ,  sure ,  I mean ,  there was at least 5 ,  I mean ,  at first ,  meeting in a place
Mmm
public .  Open site ,  at day ,  I don't know ,  something like that .  Or talking by phone ,  I don't agree that much to do that for a long time ,  you see ,  I mean
yes
like like to start to talk with someone on the internet and continue for months talking on the internet ,  I think it's a , 
yes
the idea is ,  finding someone and from there meeting in real life
Sure ,  yes ,  yes . 
And see ,  and see if the thing works our or not or how it would be if a friend , 
mm
eh ,  or a friend tells you ,  look I have a friend , 
aha
And why don't you go out together ,  is like to see if , 
mm
if the thing ,  if the thing makes sense ,  if there is ,  if there is a spark
Sure ,  that's important ,  it has its advantages and disadvantages ,  like there are people that because of their work are very busy ,  or .  I know that for another situation cannot find a partner ,  no . 
Sure ,  besides I don't know ,  I think that nowadays sometimes it's hard finding someone . 
mm mm
I mean before there were ,  were ,  were smaller communities . 
mm
So the people like knew each other more .  And another thing there was more of was common activities . 
aha
That people went to church and met other people in church . 
yes
Or I don't know everyone and ,  like ,  goes to one sole center to see each other . 
hmm
Shopping ,  I don't know what ,  but now ,  since ,  since it's a really big city like New York .   It's like ,  it's easier , 
yes
it's a big lost ,  like ,  like
Sure ,  and well many people don't go to church
Sure ,  sure . 
problem
Like ,  this ,  it's simple and if you ,  like if you don't find someone during school or during university after in a job and you don't find someone
aha
at work , 
Sure . 
Where are you going to find them then ,  in a bar ?   A bar isn't ,  it's not a good place to meet people either ,  above all they're drunk
or desperate
or desperate
Or they're there for desperation ,  disillusioned .   Well ,  suddenly no ,  yes ,  well good . 
Yes sometimes it's like a way of meeting someone who has something in common . 
Hmm . 
like you can go ,  I like to ride bikes ,  we'll go bike riding one day ,  something like that . 
aha , 
Now it's not good to have like a lot ,  like a ,  a ,  uh ,  a very long relationship over the internet .  Without knowing each other ,  because it could all be fantasy and
Oh ,  yes ,  sure
You don't really know who that other person is
Uh um ,  or it can be something ,  something suspicious ,  it could be a person that doesn't have good intentions
sure ,  sure ,  sure ,  and you can lie a lot ,  i mean ,  can you imagine ,  no one knows who you are ,  you can say anything ,  but
And ,  ¿and are you married or single ? 
But ,  well .  .  .  I'm single ,  but ,  uh
Yes
I don't know how ,  i mean ,  i lived in Chile and they said "pololeando" ,  but that's notwhat they call it here .  I don't know how you say it ,  i mean ,  i am with someone
We're hanging out together ,  and ,  in fact ,  we met on the internet
Oh ,  OK
But ,  i mean ,  it's a weird thing ,  i mean ,  we've met and we have been together for over a year now ,  yeah
Oh ,  that's so poetic ,  i am married and have two kids
Two girls ,  ¿what ,  what ages ? 
Two boys ,  one is seven and the other is three
Oh ,  look at that
And i met my husband
Tired
Oh yes
At this hour
I'm tired . 
Are they sleeping now or not yet ? 
at least they are ,  my husband came ,  he's now reading them a book so that they go to sleep . 
what thing ? 
My husband came back from work ,  or from school because he's studying in College . 
mm
No ,  he's reading the kids a book so that they go to sleep . 
mm
No ,  yes ,  I met my husband at the temple ,  at church . 
sure ,  sure ,  when they have communities like that ,  it's
mhm
it's better because you get to meet other people and you
Sure ,  you get to meet friends ,  you can ask . 
how they are ,  and sometimes you even get to meet their families ,  the friends , 
aha
but ,  if you don't have that ,  or if you don't have a similar community ,  it can be tough . 
mhm sure , 
eh ,  and you have to ,  I mean ,  no one wants to be alone ,  I mean ,  that's
sure ,  yes ,  yes ,  that's right ,  I mean ,  in this ,  there are many people ,  we all need some company . 
Sure . 
It's not good the ,  the internet is a way of
sure . 
no ,  of meeting someone . 
sure . 
Well and like they say you have to always be careful . 
Sure ,  but if you do it carefully . 
Well ok ,  you can see ,  when you're older . 
hmm
you can ,  can't really .   No ,  look ,  you can't realize what the intentions of the person are ,  no . 
hmm
The bad thing is when the teenagers go on the Internet ,  try to meet friends or someone ,  that's when it's dangerous
A sure ,  teenagers ,  no ,  sometimes they ,  don't have a a lot ,  like ,  don't ,  don't act very rationally ,  like
hmm ,  Sure ,  hmm
act like this in a way that's very ,  like how they do ,  do what they think in the moment and don't know , 
hmm
they don't always know what's correct . 
Sure . 
Like ,  I teach young people ,  I teach adolescents ,  and I know that many times . 
A ,  you teach high school
yes
ah
I teach English ,  and many times ,  I don't know they do things ,  crazy things and go and ,  and
Well yes ,  just in the adolescence when they are there with all the hormones that are changing . 
Yes there is .  No and always every year I have a pregnant girl in my class . 
ah ,  my God ,  really . 
each ,  each year ,  I mean each semester ,  I mean sometimes several . 
mm
And many times are the smartest girls ,  the most studious girls ,  and I don't know how , 
Ah what a shame ,  right . 
how they get pregnant ,  they are like sixteen years old ,  they are like girls still . 
mm mm ,  of course . 
they get pregnant ,  And there I don't know what's going to happen with them ,  they have to have ,  parents that ,  that will take care of those ,  the baby because if not they will not be able to continue studying . 
yes well yes ,  according to the society we are in ,  many parents ,  throw their kids out in the street ,  yes that's really very sad . 
Is that I know the young kids ,  I mean don't ,  don't always think with their head ,  they think with their heart or I don't know .  Or they do ,  do irrational things . 
But Well they learn that way ,  one way or another they learn .  And how long have you been married ? 
ah ,  eight years . 
Eight years ,  look . 
yes
how nice . 
Yes more or less No my husband is a very good person .  yes
How nice ,  that's nice That's what we need .  Are marriages and couples that are fine ,  I mean ,  because there are so many problems .  But I think that all society bases itself on , 
on two people that love each other .  And raise a family and from that family ,  starts a community ,  I mean from there society starts . 
Sure that's .  that's the good thing ,  that .  That suddenly the people think good ,  that they will get married and will have kids and will , 
Not try to raise them very materialistic and not spiritually . 
mm ,  sure , 
So that they are good members of society . 
Sure , 
Sure ,  because they are really needed in this society in which we are living .  No Everything so ,  so violent so .  Such horrible things that happen . 
Good evening
Good evening
Oh ,  I'm Joe ,  ¿what's your name ? 
My name is Patrick
Nice to meet you ,  ¿where are you from ? 
Likewise ,  I'm from Albuquerque ,  New Mexico
Oh ,  i live here in Denver ,  Colorado
¿You live in Denver ?  ,  that's good
Yes ,  i live here in Denver ,  and well ,  uh ,  the subject is ,  it's about the internet ,  ¿right ?  ,  about how you connect ,  how you go ,  like that ,  meeting people
¿That was the subject ?  ,  it figures
Um ,  no ,  well ,  it's that ,  i didn't ,  i didn't hear what they wanted
I think that was the subject ,  like ,  for example ,  like that ,  people you know
Oh ,  ok ,  well ,  no ,  try ,  try to ,  like that ,  well ,  like my friends or something ,  over ,  over the e mail ,  ¿right ?  ,  well ,  yes ,  i talk to them ,  but like
getting someone you can go out with ,  no ,  ¿right ?  ,  i have never ,  uh ,  done anything like that ,  ¿have you ? 
It's hard ,  because it's ,  almost everybody pretends to be something .  If a person introduces itself and says it's very beautiful or something ,  and suddenly it's very different
Or ,  has a weird personality after all
That's it
Because ,  that's happened to me too ,  uh ,  i have met persons that pretend to be nice at the time ,  and suddenly the turn out to be other kind of people
Oh ,  yes ,  no ,  yes ,  that's why i have never ,  uh ,  tried to do it like that ,  ¿right ? 
No ,  i ,  i have backed down on it .  I liked it before ,  i mean ,  i always like to make new friends over the internet ,  after they're friends it's ok ,  and ,  it's very nice
having friends that I meet from different countries .  And , 
yes ,  yes .  Like that is good .  Right ? 
but ,  like that of looking for a girlfriend or something ,  on the internet ,  that's very hard . 
And you enter ,  well ,  international chat rooms ,  or Spanish ones ,  or how do you do it ? 
Before ,  before yes ,  before I would go to ,  to ,  chat rooms ,  eh ,  for example ,  I'm Puerto Rican ,  but I would go ,  to Mexican ,  or to Argentinian , 
Ah . 
and then ,  I would go to Puerto Rican ,  yes ,  I would share with many people ,  I made a lot of friendships with very nice people ,  in Argentina ,  and from Mexico . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
But ,  it's been ,  it's been a while since I participate in the chat rooms .  And ,  there's ,  I in Puerto Rico ,  I'm in ,  ah ,  a Puerto Rican group ,  and
they always send me things ,  they let me know ,  and even share recipes of typical dishes from there ,  and things like that . 
Ah ,  well ,  yes .  That's great . 
but it makes me feel ,  it makes me feel like I'm still closed to the island .  Right ? 
Eh 
And were you born there in Albuquerque ? 
Are you from ,  from ,  from Puerto ,  Puerto Rico ,  or what ? 
yes ,  I was born in Puerto Rico .  It's just ,  that I ,  have been here in Colorado for many years already . 
Ah , 
I've been more than twenty years here in Colorado . 
Okay . 
I've never forgotten Spanish ,  and I always speak it ,  maybe I don't speak it with the accent from over there ,  but I do speak with a bit of an accent still . 
And have you gone back to ,  to ,  well ,  to know or to visit ? 
Well ,  after many years of not having gone ,  since after my father died in 1993 ,  I've not gone back .  I almost always go other places when I want to travel , 
but I've wanted to go for a while now .  I ,  I ,  I would have liked to go ,  there ,  I'd like to take my daughter .  I have a small daughter and I'd like her to know her
Puerto Rican half ,  because she is half Puerto Rican and half Mexican . 
Ah ,  so ,  yes . 
I want ,  I want to take her there to get to know Puerto Rico ,  since she's never been in the
yes ,  yes ,  that she gets to know it all ,  right ? 
So then ,  do you have many ,  do you have many friends in many parts of the world via the Internet ? 
Ah ,  no ,  no .  I'm from ,  from Albuquerque ,  but I lived in ah ,  Mexico . 
yes . 
When ,  when I was in high school .  So then , 
Ah . 
yes ,  I have many Mexican friends ,  here and ah ,  there as well .  But then ,  there is a population ,  here ,  very ,  very ,  ah ,  well ,  lots of Mexicans .  You ,  you know .  Eh , 
yes ,  here in Colorado there are many , 
yes ,  as well .  right ? 
people of Mexican heritage ,  and many who have come as well from ,  from Mexico .  The majority of the Hispanics here are from Mexico ,  or of , 
yes . 
or they are of Mexican descent
Ah ,  yes ,  or Spain .  Right ?  Spanish . 
Yes ,  yes ,  or Spanish ,  well , 
yes . 
there aren't many Puerto Ricans here .   The Puerto Ricans are concentrated more on the east side of the United States .   New York and Florida . 
yes ,  by ,  by New York and Philadelphia ,  No ?   Places like this . 
But ,  no ,  you see one ,  sometimes the stores here ,  and hey ,  a lot of people speaking Spanish .  And what internet service do you use ? 
Ah ,  if I use the internet ?   Yes ,  for ,  for studying ,  because I'm ,  I'm a student now .   And , 
Ah ,  how nice . 
to take ,  well ,  yes for
You study ,  you take your classes on the internet ? 
articles and ,  sorry ? 
You look ,  you take your classes on the internet ,  or you find references on the internet ? 
Oh ,  no ,  to look ,  yes if I'm writing an essay or something like that . 
yes ,  I use this a lot too .   If I have ,  because I was ,  even if I'm middle aged ,  but ,  I went back to university ,  and I look for a lot of articles and for essays ,  how do you say , 
yes . 
I look ,  I use the ,  key words and they take me to thins that I have to find .   I find ,  when I need to find something ,  I find it .   I'm fascinated because any information that you want to find ,  you find it , 
yes . 
in reality . 
yes ,  it's good the ,  the internet ,  yes . 
yes ,  you ,  any thing ,  ah I use Google a lot ,  Google ,  you can put more than one word .   So ,  it's more defini 
Oh ,  yes . 
defined ,  the ,  the search .   I almost always find it .   The majority of things that I want to find I find there . 
yes ,  yes . 
I like it a lot . 
yes ,  yes I use Google too .  But ,  there are many ,  ah ,  good sites for ,  in my university library ,  to
Oh ,  yes . 
ah ,  articles ,  ah specific .  yes ,  to
yes ,  I ,  in my university ,  there is a site called Cybrarian ,  then ,  they put you the links ,  related to the class
and I go there ,  then ,  I found the articles ,  and put the essay together . 
like that . 
It is very good ,  is funny ,  I like it a lot .  It is the only way I can do it nowadays ,  because I work ,  I work full time ,  and I have a daughter too ,  well ,  eh ,  it is ,  it is very difficult . 
Ah ,  yes . 
well ,  to go to a regular university .  But ,  I do have all the credits and the university I go is , 
It is like that . 
is accredited ,  well accredited nation wide . 
What is your work ? 
Well ,  I work in ,  in a Health Care company and I work as an assistant of my seller ,  in ,  eh ,  products for example ,  medical information ,  drugs information ,  treatments
we sell to hospitals ,  to drugstores ,  the government ,  any place that can use medical information ,  that could save lives .  For example ,  the drugs ,  definitions of drugs , 
we sell them as platforms like the CD ROM ,  network ,  ah ,  internet flatfiles ,  and things like that
yes . 
And ,  yes ,  I like very much what I do .  Is very complex ,  because you have always to be , a ,  it is a very competitive market .  And ,  you have to be always trained and learning new things . 
yes .  yes . 
And what do you do or are you just a student ? 
Ah ,  well ,  before ,  I was a chef ,  but now I returned to school .  And after ,  I'm going to study ,  um ,  dietetic nutrition . 
yes ,  ah ,  that's very good . 
Something like that ,  yes . 
And is there a lot of demand there in ,  in Albuquerque ,  or in New Mexico ? 
Um ,  well ,  yes ,  yes ,  well ,  all that of ,  of organic food ,  and well ,  being healthy .  Things like that .  Right ? 
yes listen to the phone how it sounds ,  is that I'm running out of batteries .  I hope the communication doesn't end before
Ah , 
the battery ,  before the communication ends ,  because if not , 
We don't have much time left for ,  how long ? 
we have like three minutes left ,  I think ,  three minutes . 
Ah ,  They give us like six ,  or like ,  how much is it ,  ah ? 
Well ,  ah ,  now ,  I believe they give us twelve .  And already ,  I see we have like three more minutes left .  In other words ,  we have
yes ,  but ,  I did the ,  the other study they did six months ago ,  something like that .  But ,  like this ,  this one is the first ,  the first time I get into this one . 
Oh ,  Is it the first time ? 
yes ,  because I was ,  was ,  was in Mexico .  Then , 
Oh ,  start with
Hold on ,  let me just make sure Hey ,  come here ,  you .  I think your phone is all messing up .  Hello ?  What are you doing ?  plant
hello ,  hello ,  who am I talking too ? 
hello ,  I'm Junior ,  Junior
I'm sorry Junior ,  Junior ,  my name is Silvia
Silvia ,  from New York ,  is that you ? 
Where do you live Junior ?  Eh ,  I'm in Philadelphia
Ah ,  Philadelphia ,  how old are you ?  Hello , 
yes ,  yes ,  I'm here ,  I have children in the university
oh ,  how old are you ? 
how old ? 
yes
why do you want to know my age ? 
because the man that was on the line speaking said that
mm well they were talking about what they call "date"
oh ,  mine was a marriage and do you think that you can get married at that age or that you shouldn't marry because of the age of the other person , 
that age made a difference in a relationship
ah well ,  do you believe that ? 
I don't care ,  it's just a number
aha ,  eh well ,  well this is weird ,  I was asked to talk about dating and the results
eh ,  the best one you've had and the worst date you've had and what do you think about Internet services that match people . 
ah ,  well ,  lets talk about that then
Well ,  what do you think about this ? 
it's good it's good ,  but sometimes not great
like here
because sometimes there are crazy people
ah ,  you tried it ? 
yes ,  I met the mom of my daughter like this
ahh
in the internet
hmm
I was talking with her for two or three months
aha
no ,  I ,  I started to talk with her and that week I  went to meet her in person
aha
and from there we kept talking and after she moved here with me
ahhh and you live together
no ,  not now ,  not anymore no
how's that ?   ahhh ,  yeah ,  the relationship ended
yes after three years
ahh and ,  and you have a daughter together ? 
yes
how old is the girl ? 
two
hmm ,  what's her name ? 
ah
what's the girl's name ? 
Alisa
ahh
she's from ,  what was the best solution for you ? 
ehhh ay no ,  I don't know ,  I couldn't say ,  there isn't one that has been better ,  what's funny to me is that they talk about dating
and with everything they say they use the word dating
yes
and ,  and I realized that what they're thinking is that they're looking ,  looking up the word "date" in the dictionary and the word date comes out
aha
and they think that dating is also date ,  eh ,  in the sense of people meeting ,  going out
yes
and that's where dating comes from
yes because at best they're wrong
yes ,  they've made a mistake ,  it's strange that it's a linguistic study and they've committed an error on such a fundamental level
yes ,  because dating doesn't mean this ,  right ? 
not at all
What does dating mean ? 
no ,  no ,  it doesn't exist
yes ,  lets see ,  ah okay
no ,  the word date is
it's yes
date related to calendar days
yes ,  that's what they did ,  they speak oh ,  I feel like calling and  telling the presidents of this research that they should get someone that can speak Spanish well . 
that can translate things because they have it all wrong . 
everything ,  it's funny because this is a research made between native Spanish speakers ,  they've got a huge list of native Spanish speakers
and having that list they still get someone that doesn't speaks Spanish . 
yes
to writ this stuff and to read it
mhm
it's pretty weird
yes ,  they are a school with professors or something ,  they could review it
yes ,  well ,  it's a very prestigious university
mhm ,  how did you find out about this survey ? 
my son is attending the university and they are doing it there ,  he gave me the information . 
ohh ,  I knew about it through a lady ,  she did it once but they didn't pay her the money
ah
but me already ,  I've already done it three times they've already paid those three times
ah then then they do this every year
ah I think that almost every month there's something new ,  every two or three months
ah really
I mean yes the first time I did it they paid me one hundred and seventy
aha
the second ,  one hundred eighty and they sent me a second check of one hundred eighty more but I don't know what it was for I called and the guy told me cash it
ah yes yes
and I cashed it ,  but it's a problem cashing it here in New York
well but one can only deposit it ,  right
yes
aha and how often do they do this because I knew of one a year and a half ago around there but that was the only one I've known of .  How often do they do this study ? 
ah I'm not too sure but which ,  which one did you know about
one that was eh like ,  like a year and a half ago that they were doing and then they said that if one called from a bunch
of different lines then they paid more
yes
that's the only one I knew of ,  have there been others then ? 
mm
since then ? 
yes there were more because there was the fisher which is in English and there was one called the mixer
Mixer ,  that's the ,  that's the one i knew
Yeah ,  i did that ,  well ,  they paid me a hundred and eighty twice
Uh um ,  ¿and what office do you call later to ask about that ? 
The same ,  the one eight eight eight ,  uh
Let me write it down ,  ¿ok ?  ,  eight
one eight eight eight
Right ,  uh um
Three eighty ,  um ,  penn
Ok ,  ok ,  yeah i will call there to have them consider me ,  yeah ,  ¿and how long will this study last ? 
Depending on what ,  what it lasts for you ,  for you when it ,  when you finish the calls
Right
The twenty five calls ,  when you finish the twenty five calls ,  then you are finished
Right
But yeah ,  it isn't over ,  i think it goes on
Uh um
And like ,  i don't know if it's going ,  you see ,  when they're going to do ,  and it's time to pay ,  there will be a lot of trouble ,  because since they have all this mixed
¿They have what mixed ? 
The topics ,  because i was talking about marriage for almost a week
Yeah ,  yeah ,  right ,  first they had ,  they had several days of talking about marriage
Yes
And last year that was different
Yeah ,  the English was all easy .  I finished quickly english ,  like in three weeks ,  because i did more than one call a day
Oh ,  ¿and you can sign up to do the Spanish and the English one too ? 
No ,  um ,  yeah ,  depending on which ones they have
Uh um ,  right ,  well ,  I'm going ,  yeah ,  i'm going to call them tomorrow ,  to see if
If there are also in the computer
¿On the computer ,  how ? 
You get in the computer ,  uh ,  and put the website ,  i am not sure which one it is ,  but they have a website and they do it like that
Uh ,  and on the website ,  you can see the studies they are doing
Yeah
Oh ,  well ,  i am going to see tomorrow ,  well ,  that's good ,  look ,  ¿what do you believe ,  like what do you think about these services that match people
To meet and to go out ,  how are they changing relationships ?  ,  ¿how does the dynamics between men and women change ? 
I am nos sure ,  ¿and you ? 
Look ,  i think ,  what i remember is that after a certain age ,  it's very hard to meet single men
Right
And that sometimes women just ,  "the man got interested in me ,  i better take him because maybe it will be three years before i run into another single"
Yeah
And ,  um ,  and ,  and ,  but it turns out that with these services there are a bunch of single men around there ,  so ,  i feel that gives women more to choose from
Yeah
And that it has to change the dynamics
yes
the ,  the ,  the woman ,  eh ,  she's less interested in putting up with a bunch of things from their men if they are mistaken . 
mhm
she knows that where he came from ,  there are five hundred more
yes
and mm ,  on the other hand ,  man can be sure that the woman is interested in him because he's the
first single man that she has met in two years
yes ,  there are thousands
eh
there are thousands and thousands of people there
exactly ,  yes ,  yes ,  I feel that those services are really going to change the dynamics
yes
I've seen that there are different ,  there are some ,  there are some that are more superficial than others and are prone to abusing
and there are some that have very strong basis and for example ,  somebody told me that the founder of e harmony was a very Christian man
that ,  that ,  h e wanted to give people a chance to meet someone with whom they could build a nice family . 
mhm
eh ,  and some other services are just to meet someone to go out parting one night ,  hello
yes ,  that's right
that's right , 
that's right ,  they are all mixed in there
eh
everything gets confused here
yes and there are some ,  there are some services that investigate the person to verify that they don't have a criminal past and that they're not married
yes
eh ,  and this is good ,  no
hmm but you have to pay for this
ahh yes you have to pay for this ,  yes definitely ,  and what I do is I think in the end these services have filled a ,  a type of vacuum . 
David
Hello my name is Wendy
How are you ? 
fine ,  fine ,  But I don't understand also the ,  the topic
Oh
is something about the Internet and the advantages and disadvantages messages
Yes of the people that find boyfriends on the Internet

yes
okay
It's called computer dating
yes ,  okay good .  Well I haven't
Where are you calling from ? 
ah ah I'm here in Arizona .  And you ?

Where are you ?  oh yes
yeah
Good well ,  Is Spanish your first language ?

English ,  for me also ,  but I like Spanish and
oh yeah ah ,  yes
I'm learning Spanish .  I'm going to try to
Are you going to school for that ? 
to have a ,  oh no ,  I'm not in school ,  are you asking
aha yeah
oh ,  no I did attend university last year but I've graduated since and I'm working now
ah
What about you ? 
no but well ,  my parents are Hispanic . 
oh ,  oh
but I was born here in New York ,  so , 
oh ,  I see ,  yes ,  my ,  no ,  but ,  I just really like Spanish ,  so I want to learn it ,  I want to be bilingual . 
pretty good ,  you speak really well
I see ,  well ,  thank you . 
yeah
ah ,  today's subject ,  ah ,  I have never done that ,  online dating ,  what about you ? 
mm ,  no ,  never
Have you experienced that ? 
no ,  never ,  I've never tried it
have you ?  Me either . 
I have ,  I have Internet in the house do you have a computer
but I know Of what ? 
Do you have a computer in the house ? 
oh ,  yes I have a computer
oh
and I've used a computer for many years and ,  I know people who have done that
sure
on the Internet .  Dating
aha
but I haven't done that .  But I think that my father did that once
oh really
computer dating ,  it wasn't a service ,  but he communicated with ah people
ah
on the computer with women and I think that he found a woman on the internet and they dated talked .  Is that how you say it
for a time ,  yes
yeah
but now they are not together ,  but she ,  well funny ,  but I think for the most part many people that ,  that use the computer to have relationships
I don't know in my experien  my experience they don't ,  they are not usually normal
no ,  I have a friend who did it
they have some problems ,  I don't know but
yeah ,  and they have ,  they have something ,  they are trying to hide something
oh ,  exactly ,  or they are strangers to a fashion ,  I see
yeah ,  it's very true
so
yeah
I ,  I think that I'm talking about all the people that use the Internet . 
sure ,  sure
But ,  in my experience ,  it is like that . 
yeah ,  I have
I'm ,  I've found that well ,  I haven't used those services to meet people but I've found people in the Internet ,  a few times
yes
but ,  eh ,  in my experience they are not ,  my experiences weren't ,  I'm not
get over here
I haven't contacted them yet
right
but ,  I did find one man once that he played ,  I did things with him for a while but we are not doing anything together now . 
but ,  that's how life is ,  right . 
yes ,  oh sure ,  yes
yeah
the ,  I see ,  one of my friends used an online dating service and she
aha
I don't know how to say dating in Spanish ,  practicing or how do you say dating
go  going out together
going out together ,  ah ,  okay ,  yes
yeah going out ,  yeah going out together
she likes to go out with ,  with many different friends on the Internet ,  she prefers those who have money and she always goes out with them
to get dinner ,  you know ,  to do things together but
that the man ,  the man pays ,  no . 
yes and he ,  she doesn't
that's good
she had a relationship with a man but I think that they aren't together now .   I don't know a person who met their husband on the Internet . 
I only know people who met other people on the Internet ,  but they aren't together now . 
yes ,  yes it's more or less something temporary ,  no . 
Exactly ,  yeah
ah like a temporary fix
exactly
Yes if you're alone ,  or want someone ,  sure ,  there's more mystery . 
hmm
you know you can make yourself more mysterious
yes
Mysterious ,  it's called
uh huh
And ,  and no ,  it doesn't ,  he doesn't know the people ,  you don't  know the neighborhood ,  you know ,  people comes to live across the street ,  i have a friend that's dating a girl that's like three hours from his house
i didn't know ,  she doesn't know him ,  doesn't know the family ,  doesn't know
Yes ,  exactly
You know ,  his experiences .  Because ,  you know ,  everybody has a reputation
Yeah
So ,  uh ,  but if you're in the same town ,  everyone knows each other and the boys already know ,  don't ,  don't mess with him ,  he's no good ,  this and that
So ,  you know ,  on the internet nobody knows
Yeah ,  i think it's possible to meet a man ,  a ,  a ,  a person only  over the internet ,  it's a trend
Oh
a good one to start meeting other people ,  other persons ,  but
sure
You can't know everything about the person ,  so you find that person
Yeah ,  its more mysterious to me because ,  uh ,  you don't ,  you don't know ,  you can tell a lie there ,  there's where the biggest lies come from ,  you know
That's it ,  i think a lot of people lie on the internet
Yeah ,  you know
And ,  for example ,  they're ,  they send a picture over the e mail
Right ,  right
of someone better looking
yes yes
and when they agree to find them
aha
and the person is everything ,  looks completely different than in the picture
yeah ,  those ,  that can't be
and sometimes people do that ,  I don't know why
yeah
I can understand but they want to find that person when you already sent ,  when they have
yeah
they sent different pictures , 
sure ,  they started ,  they started the relationship with lies you know
I see ,  exactly ,  I see
so so you start on a bad foot but
I've seen oh ,  just recently ,  I've seen lots of ads of an internet service called Harmony dot com ,  have you seen them ? 
right ,  harmony do ,  yes ,  there are many around here too
and they say in the ad that you can find your ,  like ,  mate
a couple ,  a partner
I see , 
a partner
for life ,  I see
yeah ,  yeah
but I don´t know if that´s the case in the majority
that´s more sex because they ,  they ,  um ,  they ,  how do you say it ,  they checks they check your your nonsense ,  the lies
yes
if you lie ,  they check it first ,  then they pair you up with serious people ,  not with people who are ,  flight by night it´s called
oh ,  ya ,  yeah
you know ,  and you have to pay for the service ,  so ,  if you´re going to pay for the service ,  you know ,  it has to be real ,  you know
yes ,  I´ve visited these sites like Harmony dot com and they ask a lot of questions
oh yeah
to apply for this service ,  you do have to pay and they ask a lot about your life ,  your goals in life and ,  ah
your religion
appearance and
yeah ,  religion and all
it´s extensive ,  a lot of work is a word ,  yeah ,  the application
excessive
but now
you are in Colorado you said
no Arizona
Arizona but that´s near Colorado ,  right ? 
yes ,  yes ,  that´s near ,  but here it´s very hot ,  and it´s very cold there
yeah ,  but there are many
special ,  in this
yeah ,  there are lots of Hispanics down there ,  right
sure ,  oh sure ,  yes ,  when I lived there ,  most of my life in El Paso Texas
aha
and about seventy five percent of the population there are Hispanics
wow
yes ,  I was a minority there
yeah
I see
yeah ,  it's like
but ,  it doesn't affect me . 
it's like the Bronx ,  if you go ever here to New York ,  here in the city
oh ,  yes
the city ,  around seventy five percent are Hispanics
yes ,  I ,  last month ,  a month and a half ago ,  oh ,  my friend from Ecuador ,  he's now living here in New York City
it was my first time in New York ,  last month
oh ,  did you like it ? 
I had so much fun ,  it was interesting but I don't know if I could live there . 
I see ,  it is different ,  it's a city full ,  full of people ,  they live like cockroaches . 
ah of course
Yeah they live like roaches
yes
they come out from everywhere ,  and at night also
but the city is very interesting there's a lot ,  there are no limits to the things you can do . 
sure ,  yeah and it's always open
exactly And I like that there's a lot of different foods ,  ah like ah oh like
right
foreign foods ,  yes
yeah from different countries
exactly ,  yes
yeah ,  but there's a little town called Port Chester that's outside of the Bronx

Well ,  at first I didn't understand what dating was ,  until
I think that it said pitcher ,  and I thoug ,  Oh ,  I don't know any about baseball
Let's see ,  what was your worst date with someone ? 
Oh ,  I have had so many in the past ,  It's like ,  let's say ,  well ,  I met my husband in a site called ICQ
Okay ,  yes
And ,  but ,  I met other boys before in that website
Mmm
and ah ,  well ,  no ,  not all of them were ah ,  weird ,  but ,  some that were ,  on on the phone that sound good ,  like ,  oh ,  this really cute guy ,  sounds like , 
Aha
and when one goes to see him ,  is like ,  ah ,  my God ,  Why did I come ?  But ,  yes ,  and ,  and ,  also
And has it ever happened to you that you go out with someone ,  to a restaurant ,  and at the end it doesn't work out ? 
Ah ,  Yes ,  sometimes ,  and ,  yes .  Also ,  I've also used ,  dating services on ,  on the phone , 
Mm .

Mm
And then ,  ah ,  I went out with this guy ,  and we went to McDonalds ,  eh ,  and he took me to his apartment , 
Mm .

And at the end not so cute ? 
And ,  yes . 
Me ,  let's see ,  um ,  a date that has gone bad . 
Mm . 
Mm ,  I think I never had bad luck . 
Ah ,  how nice . 
Ah ,  because I never went out much with ,  let's say in the university ,  when I was in the university ,  I went out with my friends . 
Mm .  Ah ,  okay ,  mm . 
And ,  we would go out to the bars and to dance ,  and ,  always ,  almost always ,  I would just stay with them .  That's why ,  I hardly ever had a boyfriend ,  because I was always with them . 
Mm ,  yes . 
And ,  later ,  eh ,  mm ,  later ,  yes ,  almost only with friends .  If I met someone ,  I would start going out with him ,  but ,  like that ,  let's say ,  going to dinner ,  and then to ,  the movies and , 
Mm . 
I don't think I ever had such bad luck .  I think ,  yes ,  yes ,  And if I had it ,  bad luck ,  apparently I already forgot . 
Yes ,  no ,  I never had bad luck ,  only bad luck that on the phone they sounded really cute ,  and then when you go to see him , 
Mm .  And ,  but you say you met your husband through  ICQ ? 
Yes ,  aha . 
Aha .

Aha . 
without knowing each other ,  Right ?

Poor him .

Getting to know each other .

Speed ,  speed dating ?  Oh . 
Speed dating .

Then ,  they pair up the woman and the man , 
Aha .

Aha .  Okay
Ad after the two minutes ,  they continue to the other person . 
I've already seen it on TV ,  yes ,  aha .

Eh ,  what impression can one get ?  Just ,  eh ,  physical . 
Yes . 
He's handsome ,  he's not handsome ,  I like his voice ,  I don't like his voice . 
Yes ,  it's true ,  right
It's little
yes ,  yeah
Just
Well ,  but there exis  ,  it sometimes exists ,  love at first sight
Yes
But ,  uh ,  sometimes it isn't
Uh huh
But ,  lets say ,  uh ,  if you like this boy ,  oh ,  and ,  and ,  and you like him ,  you can tell in two minutes ,  you can ask him ¿do you smoke or not ? 
¿do you drink or not ?  ,  uh ,  ¿what else ,  what else ?  ,  oh ,  i think you need to have a list of questions
Oh ,  yeah ,  you have to bring like a script of the questions you're interested to ask ,  and these are the only ones I'll ask
Two minutes ,  yeah
I mean ,  you can't have a conversation in two minutes ,  of course
Oh no ,  well ,  yeah ,  that's why I'm telling you ,  well ,  have some questions you're going to ask
Uh huh
For two minutes ,  ¿right ?  ,  and from there ,  if you like his answers ,  uh ,  so you have to ask his phone number or someone else ,  ¿right ?  ,  i don't understand ,  ¿how do you do that ? 
Uh ,  they give you their phone number themselves ,  so ,  uh ,  you write the number of the people you're interested in .  And later on ,  the organizers
Oh
ask you for those people's contact
Oh ,  OK
Mm . 
But ,  eh ,  it would already be ,  be something weird ,  because if the girl like the guy ,  and the guy doesn't like the girl , 
yes . 
is weird ,  yes . 
yes ,  and that's another thing ,  well ,  that ,  the chance that they both like each other at the same time .  Right ?  yes .  I agree .  It seems
a little too drastic . 
Yes ,  is true .  The disadvantages of that ,  I say ,  of dating like that ,  not ,  not like you said ,  but in ,  in the website ,  on the internet , 
or on the phone ,  sometimes there are people that are kind of strange , 
Mm . 
that you don't know who you are going to meet . 
And have you ever had a bad experience like that ,  with someone who's ,  dangerous ,  perhaps ,  or I don't know ,  weird
No . 
No . 
No .  nothing ,  thank God ,  nothing . 
what luck . 
Yes ,  and ,  and you ? 
No ,  no .  I haven't .  Mm ,  no ,  I don't think so .  Someone who was dangerous ?  No . 
Okay . 
I think that
No ,  me neither . 
in thank God ,  so to speak . 
Yes .  Because there are some psychos . 
Mm .  yes ,  it can be dangerous ,  and more let's say ,  one like this ,  Right ?  by internet ,  one thinks that perhaps you're talking with ,  you never know . 
That's why ,  little by little ,  Right ? 
Aha ,  yes ,  is true .  Yes . 
Mm ,  One never knows that ,  the person ,  perhaps ,  on the other side ,  says something ,  and ,  and no . 
Yes .  They tell you that they are let's say ,  two years older than you . 
Aha . 
And when you meet him ,  you find that ,  he's younger or super old . 
Or how about when they tell you I'm this weight ,  and this height ? 
Ah ,  yes ,  also ,  that's even worse .  Yes ,  is true . 
I'm thin ,  tanned ,  muscular ,  grey or green eyes ,  not even close . 
Ah ,  Yes .  I remember once ,  that I spoke with this older man ,  have to call him that , 
Mm
because young he wasn't .  And ,  he had a really big van , 
Mm
and then ,  we were going to meet at a gas station .  Then ,  I told my mom to take me to the gas station ,  when we see him ,  my mom says ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  way ,  let's get away from here . 
yes ,  because there ,  God forbid . 
That van was really big . 
Mm
My mom said ,  no ,  mom ,  I can get money .   I can ,  I can do it to go to eat in an expensive restaurant ,  she said ,  no ,  no . 
But your mom was going to leave you at the restaurant and wait outside for you . 
No ,  no ,  she said no ,  no way ,  we're getting out of here .   She said , 
yes . 
yeah .   Because ,  she was the big one ,  the first time that she saw him .   And so ,  who knows what will happen . 
Bu  they pin you down and they put you in back of the shell ,  you know ,  that you're going to be pinned back there ? 
Yeah ,  it's true . 
yes . 
For this my mom said ,  no .   No ,  better not .   Let's get out of here ,  and I went with my makeup and everything .   My dad didn't know anything ,  or my brother ,  or my mother .   Right ? 
But ,  lucky that you mom was with you .   Because ,  what if ?   Well ,  you never know ,  sometimes ,  right ? 
Yeah .   Yeah ,  it's true . 
Maybe the impulse ,  or maybe not .   I was talking with him for a long time ,  I know that he wouldn't do anything to me .   Right ? 
Yeah ,  it's true .   Yeah ,  but ,  a mother's instinct ,  I say . 
Hmm . 
yes Right ? 
yes . 
She said ,  no ,  no .   You know what ?   Better not ,  better not .   We'll find another there ,  or something like this .   But better to go ,  you don't know what he will to do you . 
Keep trying ,  she says . 
Yeah ,  it didn't look so bad .   But ,  they go .   .  first time , 
Ah ,  to know ,  you never know
first time that I looked ,  yeah ,  it's true . 
No ,  truly that neither .   But ,  and let's say ,  well ,  let's say ,  I ,  maybe ,  not trusting but yes ,  like ,  hmm ,  aye ,  I don't know trusting ,  that maybe would say like trusting ,  but

still looking for some of them ,  I believe that a lot of them
are staying . 
they are still looking . 
Sure ,  it was really ,  it was unexpected ,  it was such a big tragedy ,  right ? 
No ,  no
Lots of people died ,  the city shut down completely ,  right ? 
I say that
They had to be evacuated , 
what is going on and then one more hit ,  oh my God ,  I don't know ,  how can that be . 
Yes ,  well ,  really ,  that makes us realize that our material belongings ,  our lives are temporal ,  isn't it ?  We really don't
I don't know
something happens ,  then something else happens and you loose your things
and one should instead focus on family ,  right ? 
No ,  focusing on the family and focusing on our relationship with God .   Because it's really important too . 
This is true .   And you go ?   Your husband is from there or he's American ? 
No ,  he's American .

Aha
Sometimes I can't answer and they leave the message
Oh ,  you find the message in the machine ,  right ? 
Yes ,  they leave the message and then ,  eh ,  then if I don't call back ,  they call me later ,  for instance ,  they call me at six o'clock and then they call me at
if I don't answer they call me about ,  this time ,  nine o'clock or half past nine

and I didn't notice ,  because since I was doing another thing I didn't notice ,  but then it got fixed ,  to my schedule ,  right ? 
Yes ,  I think that at this time ,  most of the people is at home .  Well ,  although there are time differences ,  right ?  between cities ,  when it is
beside ,  for instance here in Los Angeles ,  they have
Do you have a central to call there ? 
Oh ?

Oh ,  I see

Sure ,  because they have to
but
the ,  it's a different time ,  there are a lot of time differences ,

Aha
and they connected me with someone ,  and they hung up . 
Oh ,  maybe the people didn't know what they were talking about . 
Maybe . 
But ,  um ,  I understood for me how was the first day of ,  when ,  um your date with your boyfriend . 
Hm mm
and , um ,  well for eh ,  for me was ,  um ,  in his brother's house , 
Aha
we arranged to meet there ,  we saw each other there , 
Aha
and there we met ,  and like two weeks later we went out
Aha
and um ,  then ,  um ,  you would make a date with someone
Aha
and ,  and ,  it wasn't like now .  Before there was a lot of respect . 
Oh Oh ,  aha . 
Not now . 
Aha
Now um ,  the guys nowadays think that when you make a date is because you are already going to go to bed with them . 
That's how it is . 
Some ,  some . 
Aha
And the ones before ,  and before there was a lot of respect . 
Aha
and they were like ,  like they say ,  um ,  of sweaty hands . 
Oh ,  that's it . 
Then ,  um ,  that of meeting people from personal ads ,  or by the Internet is very dangerous . 
Ah ,  it is . 
Because um ,  I know a friend ,  that did that through the Internet , 
Oh ,  aha . 
and eh ,  she gave a lot of information to the guy and all , 
Aha . 
and he left her in the street .  He emptied her bank account he took it out
Oh God . 
And that's why it's a danger ,  because you don't know
Aha
who you are meeting by ,  by ,  um ,  oh meeting on the Internet
Aha
to whom you are giving your personal information and all
yes I also know a girl who got married with a um ,  man that she met on the Internet
Aha
and they got married and all ,  they lasted four years ,  but then it came out that he was touching her daughters . 
Wow ,  she didn't know who he was ? 
No
She didn't know if ,  if it was a ,  a de  sexual harrasment ,  that he had uh in another place or something , 
Aha
Oh my God girl
Aha ,  it turned out really ugly . 
That's a danger . 
I don't ,  I'm really afraid of of that ,  it's ,  I'm afraid of kno  to say ,  if I got separated from my husband , 
Aha
I'm really afraid of meeting someone else . 
Aha ,  ha ,  specially how things are now . 
Because no ,  I don't ,  ne  I can't have trust nor
No ,  no ,  n  no . 
none .  Hm hmm
It's very dangerous ,  very dangerous . 
That's it . 
Because ,  um ,  you know how the world is now ,  that ,  that so much ,  um criminal that's on the streets , 
Aha
that they can change their name .  You don't know the name they're using , 
Aha
very ,  is ,  dangerous ,  dangerous ,  dangerous . 
Aha No I met my husband ,  I was with some friends
Aha
and well there was a group of them
Aha
and I met him like that ,  but I really ,  when I met him and wanted nothing to do with him . 
Aha
But he kept on talking to me ,  he kept on looking for me
Aha ,  aha
and then ,  one night he told me well why don't your friend ,  and you ,  and us a friend of his ,  and
Aha
and him go out ,  and I told my friend ,  you think we should go
Aha
and she said ,  yes let's go .  They're going to pay the dance to go free
Aha ,  aha
So we went with them and already since that day ,  I wasn't apart from him . 
Aha
Then ,  thank God it worked out good . 
But ,  but you didn't look into um ,  um ,  his background or something ,  you didn't ask someone how he was ,  who he was or anything ? 
Oh ,  well yes of course . 
Aha
Aha and as we said .  In the beginning ,  when he'd call me , 
Aha
um ,  I once ,  I once got another call when I was talking to them , 
Aha
and I answered another call and I didn't go back to the line with him , 
Aha
and he waited for about an hour for me to pick up again
Aha
And I never called him back ,  so he called me , 
Aha
and he told me ,  hey look ,  if you don't want to talk to me ,  you should tell me because what you did last night
Aha ,  aha . 
that was cruel ,  but ,  as I said ,  thank God everything went well but if I had to do it all over again ,  I couldn't . 
No ,  it's dan  ,  it's dangerous because um you don't know ,  the background ,  that ,  that this person that you are getting to know
Aha
he can tell you ,  this ,  this is something ,  he's going to come up with other things . 
Aha , 
And ,  and oh ,  and so ,  um ,  for example ,  you get to meet someone and you are with him ,  there ,  there ,  there and you get to have an intimate relationship with him , 
Aha
and that he's a ,  that he's sick ,  you don't know if he's sick . 
Aha yes
is ,  is a lot of danger a lot of danger . 
Aha
Because the sickness you don't see ,  on the outside . 
No
They have the sickness on the inside . 
Is true . 
And that comes out with time it comes out ,  because it also doesn't come out um ah ,  fast . 
Aha
And ,  and ,  since there are ,  um ,  also so many ,  so many um uh ,  how is it ,  men abusing children , 
Yes
you don't know if he's been in jail ,  yes
Hm mm
yes ,  for ,  for abusing children ,  or for theft , 
Aha
or for killing someone .  Is dangerous . 
Yes it is . 
Because um ,  also to send a ,  a picture through the Internet
Aha
that's also a danger too
No ,  uh , 
You don't know who you're sending that report to . 
No
And you don't know um ,  no ,  I don't know if you heard the news about ,  about a girl who has getting that ,  sending reports to ,  to her boyfriend
No ,  I didn't hear about that . 
and her boyfriend ,  and her boyfriend ,  did a ,  um ,  something that ,  that ,  he put on the internet
Uh huh
but he put it for her ,  um ,  like ,  as a girl ,  looking for guys . 
Oh God . 
And ,  and ,  she ,  I don't know how he did it ,  a post where she um ,  was naked on the internet . 
Oh . 
And it's dangerous because of that too . 
No ,  on the internet I don't even have like two ,  three friends that I talk with on the internet ,  that's all ,  and that's it . 
Uh huh
even my son ,  ta  once I found him talking with a girl on the internet
Uh huh
and I asked my son what it was that she had
Uh huh
And she answered ,  oh ,  all the drugs .  And my son told her ,  uh ,  what drugs ,  and she said
Aha

Aha
and eh ,  in that moment when I saw what he was writing , 
Aha
and I started writing ,  I told him ,  I'm his mom , 
Aha
and he should not be here talking with a girl that is into that kind of thing . 
Aha
And I told him um I don't want to see again
Aha
that you're writing to my son .  And I will save this message in case I have to show it to the police . 
Aha ,  aha . 
And she told me ,  well you know what you want ,  I'm playing ,  and I said ,  I wrote and I told her , 
Aha
you know ,  I don't think it's that ,  it's not a thing that one would
One can jo  joke about ,  aha ,  ha ,  ha , ha . 
should play with .  But there are many baddies that get in there ,  and look that my son is thirteen no more . 
yes yes Aha ,  ha ,  ha ,  ha ,  ha ,  ha . 
Eh
Like ,  like also a lot also a lot ,  that comes out on the internet of ,  of men um ,  having sex with small children eh ,  on the Internet also , 
Yes Aha
many people that they've caught .  Many ,  I even think they caught a cop imagine that . 
Hm
Here in Chicago . 
Ah ,  how bad
Is ,  is a danger ,  is a danger ,  especially for the small kids also . 
how bad .  Hm mm ,  well I don't let him play on the internet anymore . 
Aha
If I'm not there behind him ,  I don't let him play there . 
Aha
No ,  because he's not ,  going to start getting bad things from there . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
But that scared me pretty badly ,  because he's always been a good boy . 
Hm mm
And ,  messing with some girls ,  or ,  or ,  or like that
Hm mm ,  aha
bad ,  and put bad things in his head ,  no . 
Aha ,  aha  ,  aha
I'm not going to allow that . 
Yeah ,  because later on ,  um ,  for example ,  he could go to school ,  talk about that with ,  with some classmate
Right
and ,  the teacher ,  uh ,  the first thing they'll believe was the mom
Oh ,  right
So ,  um ,  if you told them that they got it from the Internet ,  so where were you when your son was ,  uh ,  playing on the internet with someone else
Right
That you have to have ,  uh ,  your eyes wide open for that
Yes
Because that's the first thing they do ,  uh ,  in school
Right
That's the first thing
Right
Because yeah ,  i told that to a classmate ,  uh ,  just relaxed ,  saying ,  "look ,  i met a girl on the internet ,  and she was telling me about this and that"
Uh huh
Uh ,  the boy he told that to ,  he was gonna tell someone else ,  and that kept on ,  and the whole school was going to know ,  even the principal could know
Right ,  yes
And ,  and who ,  uh ,  the one who was going to pay was you
Yes
Because it's dangerous ,  because of it ,  on the internet
Oh
There are some parents that don't realize what their kids are doing on the internet . 
Uh huh ,  i wish they could fix that from the internet ,  so those things won't happen ,  but that's impossible . 
No ,  it's impossible ,  very impossible
I remember when i was little ,  we didn't have problems like that
No ,  no
Uh huh
But now ,  yeah ,  you know we're in the ,  in the two thousand already ,  two thousand and five ,  two thousand and six
Yes
it's dangerous ,  yeah girl ,  dangerous
Right
Specially over the internet ,  and the phone too
Uh huh ,  that's right
You have to know who your son is talking with on the phone
Right
Who is he giving information to and everything
Yes , 
The ,  uh ,  you can't even give your address to people ,  not even on the internet ,  on the phone ,  nothing
Uh huh
Or ,  or talk about personal stuff either . 
Yeah ,  that's true
It's so dangerous girl . 
No ,  I feel bad just thinking about it ,  how are things going to be seventeen years from now
Aha ,  ha ,  ha . 
Oh ,  how am I going to fight
when he's older ,  God willing ,  yes . 
Yes
and he's almost ,  he's almost there . 
Oh ,  uh ,  I know . 
I see ,  he's almost a teenager now
I know . 
Yes ,  but she trusts you ,  doesn't he ? 
Oh no . 
Good afternoon ,  this is Mildre spaking ,  from Connecticut . 
Halo Hi I'm Nicole ,  How are you ? 
Fine thank you , Where are you from ? 
From New York
oh aha
And where are you from ? 
Didn't I speak to you a little while ago ,  no .  From Connecticut ,  aha
eh ,  I don't know ,  I don't remember ,  I don't think so ,  of did I ? 
What country are you from ? 
From Cuba . 
Oh
I mean my family is from Cuba . 
aha
And I was born here .  eh , 
I'm Puerto Rican . 
ah ,  yes Maybe we did talk How are you ? 
Everything's fine ,  preparing dinner
you have a daughter ,  a daughter . 
yes aha
Now I do remember
I have ,  I have five . 
ah
But I have the Little one she's the only one that lives with me ,  the others are already adults .  I just have a scrap there .  This question of the ,  of the . 
It says of the worst moments and of the good moments is what it says . 
I mean what it says is . 
And of the use of the internet . 
are the the dates ,  but I think what they mean with dates are the romantic dates .  Is that they are translating it .  From English . 
aha
And they put a date and the machines says dates but I don't think they are dates they are romantic dates in other words they are saying eh
good times and bad times ,  I imagine ,  right . 
In other words the best and worst dates .  And if one ,  looks .  For dates through the internet . 
oh ,  okay
That's what I think was the question . 
ah ,  okay
eh . 
yes because it says dates aha
they said dates ,  in other words the best dates .  Is that it sounds like weird . 
aha ,  aha I'm saying date but ,  what is that ,  well no . 
But then it says ,  then
I ,  when it said date I thought that it was ,  related to ,  when you have your best times and your bad times in life . 
Sure ,  sure ,  this is how it sounds
uh huh
But ,  I know that it's the same word ,  like .   The word for date and date is the same word in English ,  I think it's because of this . 
aha ,  aha ,  aha
because ,  like it's like a machine transla 
yes because it's related if you are dating somebody in the internet . 
Sure
uh huh
Sure .  Well ,  so
No well I don't
I don't know what you think about the ,  the internet ,  about the dates or anything . 
Well ,  I've had really good dates and I've had really bad dates
Sure ,  sure . 
yes because sometimes you meet people who after don't turn out to be good . 
uh huh
And well ,  you have a good time with one and have a good time with the other
um
I think that the best dates are when you're young .   Because you enjoy more ,  it's more .   And after when you start to look for a partner and for something more serious ,  that's when the
problems begin ,  I think .   The headaches and the suffering .   And sadness .   But when you're young ,  all the dates are precious .  I find . 
hm
When you get involved with ,  with people then ,  I think that when there are dates like as friends ,  you enjoy them more . 
Sure , 
And after when you get into a relationship as a couple .   And things get more difficult . 
yes sure . 
eh ,  at times you know someone who when you talk with her on the telephone it's one thing and after when you know them personally in reality ,  a lot changes . 
Ah yes ,  a looking on the internet .  The person can be very different from what you thought . 
uh huh
eh ,  but
I've never met anyone on the internet .   I don't look ,  I've never looked for a partner .   I've always met them at a party ,  on a trip . 
On the internet ,  oh Sure . 
And so ,  things like that ,  no ,  no partners on the internet .   Have you used the internet for a partner ? 
yes . 
yes ? 
But not something like , 
And what . 
not something like for conversation .   For many months on the internet ,  nothing like that .   Like getting on the internet and meeting . 
uh huh uh huh
And if they seem good of if the person seems kind ,  yes .   And if not ,  no ,  like . 
uh huh
What ,  what I don't like about the internet is ,  how to have a ,  a long relationship on the computer without meeting .   Because there you can ,  like ,  you can really have another impression of the person . 
I prefer ,  to know people there .  there ,  like ,  not immediately ,  but after one or two emails . 
So you prefer to know them fast ,  not to wait to much on chatting on the internet and after that it result another thing . 
Of course . 
And how ,  how ? 
So I
So How are your experiences when you meet the person you have been talking to ? 
So sometimes really not ,  sometimes you ,  you go to dinner ,  is like you go out to eat .  You go to eat with that person . 
aha
And sometimes you have a ,  like a good ,  a good feeling with the person when you are on the computer ,  but when you two meet ,  is like you don´t . 
aha aha
Is like the other one is boring or ,  or , 
It is not ,  the same that he told you on the computer
of course ,  or he is a jerk ,  or not so ,  so gentle ,  eh many times ,  sometimes you notice it on the phone . 
so eh ,  I have met people that write to me and when they begin to talk on the phone ,  I immediately notice that ,  so ,  they begin to tell you all their problems . 
um
I think you don´t .  No ,  you have to be patient .  But I knew a
don´t you think that some people do it to end the relationship ,  you know ,  the chat or you . 
When they want to end with you , 
I don´t know ,  I met my ,  I met my boyfriend through the internet ,  and we have been together for over a year . 
With your boyfriend . 
yes
or your husband ? 
No ,  no boyfriend ,  boyfriend ,  em . 
You met on the internet . 
yes
yes
yes like ,  he lives here in New York .   em ,  but it wasn't an attraction like that ,  seeing many people .   I never used it to get dates , 
every week
uh huh ,  uh huh
I used it like to get to know someone ,  because I wanted to meet someone . 
aha
eh ,  and I'm a teacher and at my job ,  we're all women .   I wanted to meet someone interesting and not at a bar .   And I didn't know where ,  but ,  it was something ,  so I went
And no the internet ,  I also find that it's more or less like if it were a bar ,  because in a bar you will also find people in that moment who are more likable , 
um
and after when you keep going out and you know them ,  the thing changes . 
Sure ,  sure ,  well the difference is that in a bar ,  everyone's drinking and also ,  you're basing a lot on the physical appearance ,  I think . 
aha
how ,  I don't know much about the person ,  at least on the internet you can know a little ,  about common interests ,  or I don't know ,  it goes a bit more slowly
You write two or three times ,  after you talk on the phone .  And after like two weeks ,  you meet .   So ,  it's not like going to a bar and meeting someone that day ,  a
the other day no ,  that's not interesting .   I don't know ,  I don't know ,  it depends on the luck ,  I think it depends on luck like all couples
aha yes you always need to find the ,  as they say the person that ,  that shares more or less ,  the same ,  the same likes ,  the same interests , 
since sometimes is good ,  but I'm a little bit scared ,  I'm a little scared of the internet . 
yes ,  yes ,  I mean to have to do it carefully .  So . 
Especially ,  I'm very scared for the kids . 
Ah yes . 
For the kids there's so many ,  of these impostors that pretend to be kids ,  they are these ,  bad people . 
Yes that's true ,  you have to be careful ,  I mean ,  you have to go to a public place .  In other words never go to the person's house . 
Or invite them to your house ,  I mean not the first date ,  nor the second ,  nor the third ,  something public in a restaurant ,  or ,  or in the street ,  I don't know . 
To meet and take it from there . 
oh , 
But at my job ,  many women have done it ,  already . 
aha I have a work colleague that used to do it ,  but she would do it more how do I say it ,  she would look more for a sex partner . 
ah
so she was .  When she met someone ,  she would go to bed with him and later ,  she would end it with that one ,  and the next week she already had another and
No ,  no ,  no ,  I didn't do it like that ,  because I don't like that ,  that makes me feel like
In the list
Bad ,  to do it like that ,  and besides ,  is dangerous ,  that is dangerous indeed . 
No that's why I tell you ,  that ,  aha ,  aha yes but she was ,  like I told her but you are crazy ,  how are you going to meet that guy and in
the same night that you go out with him ,  ah but we are adults ,  we don't have to be in a relationship . 
yes ,  one ,  one can do those things ,  but not for me ,  but absolutely not for me ,  well I don't do anything
yes ,  but it depends on the person
Sure ,  sure ,  well ,  there are people ,  there have always been people who
yes ,  she only went out with them ,  I mean ,  she says she didn't want a ,  how you call it ?  she didn't want a serious relationship with a man to be with him ,  she just wanted to
Sure
have sex ,  just that
Sure
use them to
Well ,  there is a lot ,  there is a lot of that in the Internet also ,  I mean if you are looking for someone just for sex
if you like that ,  I have seen the ,  how you call it ?  ,  the personals looking for couple
Sure
selling themselves and posting photos ,  and sometimes when you go it's not even the one in the photo posted
um
I have never ,  never done that ,  but I've seen it .  My girl has gone out with people on the internet .  I know she has met some ,  just like you ,  she meets them and go out for dinner
but she has not  , she has not sen any yet
um
that she met on the Internet
No ,  I do know people who have married
yes
Hello ,  Whom am I speaking with ? 
Hello ,  Mayra's speaking . 
Ah ,  Mayra ,  my name is Silvia .  Where are you from ,  Mayra ? 
I'm right now in Philadelphia ,  I study here , 
Ah . 
the university . 
Um ,  I'm also in Philadelphia . 
Ah .  Really ?  Where ? 
yes ,  In ,  in the outskirts ,  because my son studies in the university . 
Ah ,  really ? 
yes ,  in Penn . 
Ah ,  I'm also in Penn . 
Ah ,  look at that And ,   ? 
What year is your son in ? 
He's a senior .  His name is Jose
Okay ,  Mrs .  you are not going to believe what a coincidence , 
Why ? 
but I think you spoke with my mom . 
yes ,  yes ,  I 
My mom is in San Antonio ,  Texas . 
that ,  that told me that the daughter was in Penn studying chemical engineering . 
Aha . 
Ah . 
What a coincidence ,  but yes ,  that's me . 
Ah ,  well ,  yes ,  what a coincidence . 
And how are you ?  Listen ,  And how did you find out about this program ? 
Through my son . 
Ah ,  okay ,  So he's also doing it ,  or no ? 
yes ,  he's also doing it ,  yes . 
Wow ,  well what a funny coincidence . 
yes ,  yes . yes . 
Okay . 
And ,  and how is that you're studying ,  um ,  such a hard career like chemical engineering ? 
I don't know . 
No ,  but ,  I admire that a lot . 
The truth is that I don't know why I did that to myself . 
yes ,  I admire it a lot . 
Thank you very much .  No ,  I like science a lot . 
Mm . 
And ,  mm ,  and ,  mm ,  well ,  I like to learn the things that you learn when someone is an engineer .  So , 
Mhm
also because I am not ,  I was not sure when I chose of what I wanted to do in the future
MHm
I supposed that engineering would give me more opportunities
yes ,   I have no doubt about it ,  yes
to ,  mhm ,  So
Mm ,  and
let me tell you ,  I am a junior right now ,  I am in the third year
Mm
And ,  it has been hard ,  but not impossible ,  it is not so difficult .  I will get worse
Oh ,  really ? 
but so far so good
Oh ,  because in the two final years ,  eh ,  the matter is more difficult
They are already of engineering ,  the first two years are like common sciences ,  physics ,  chemistry and things that everybody has to study
Mm
And ,  now I already started with plenty of engineering
Oh
So ,  right now it is serious
yes ,  and how much is chemistry and how much is engineering in that degree ? 
It's a lot of ,  mm ,  chemical engineering is the degree ,  in the whole university ,  that asks for more credits to graduate
Oh
So ,  it's like ,  like seven subjects of chemistry ,  I think
Mhm
and it must be like twnty some of engineering ,  more or less ,  needed .  In addition
Oh ,  then it's more an engineering than ,  I  , I thought
Mhm
that it was more chemistry than engineering
No ,  no ,  no .  It's
Mhm
It's more of an engineering with a little chemistry .  But ,  we all end up knowing a lot of chemistry
Oh ,  aha
but we are not too specialized
I see .  Mm
Mhm .  So ,  it's rather the ,  the way they teach engineering .  We learn a lot on amterials and reactions ,  things like this
Mhm
that are used ,  instead of mechanical engineering ,  for instance ,  that are studying design ,  right ? 
Aha ,  aha ,  mhm
The shape of something ,  or something like this
Mm
We rather do chemical reactions
Aha ,  hmm ,  hmm . 
So ,  I think that it's better for this . 
I have ,  eh ,  of my three kids ,  two have studied engineering . 
Seriously ? 
yes ,  yes .   Eh ,  I have a daughter who graduated a few years ago who is an aerospace engineer . 
Wow . 
And ,  yes ,  yes .   And she works in ,  in Washington .   And ,  so ,  my youngest son is also a junior , 
Hmm . 
and is studying in Cornell ,  eh ,  computer engineering . 
Wow .   This is really difficult .   This is the most difficult I think . 
yes .   Well ,  I think that it's less difficult than chemical engineering .   But ,  yes it's difficult .   He told me that ,  that ,  eh ,  em ,  the ,  the
his discipline ,  that ,  hmm ,  his specialization ,  is considered computing and electronics engineering
Okay . 
because they say that for the one and for the other ,  they're almost the same courses . 
Ah ,  okay .   So ,  you're good .   I went to ,  how does he like it ?   I went to Cornell .   Those were my two options ,  Penn or Cornell . 
Ah . 
yes . 
He likes it a lot .   Eh ,  they give him a lot of work ,  but without a doubt to you too . 
Hmm . 
Em .   What there is ,  Aye .   I like the cold more than him ,  more than the heat ,  but I was never excited to go to Ithaca . 
No ,  is too much already .  Right ? 
Is too much ,  yes . 
yes . 
yes ,  and it gets dark ,  in winter ,  it gets dark very early .  And ,  and they always have snow and cold ,  it's much more cold there than here . 
Ah ,  okay .  No ,  and me here I'm suffering .  I wasn't used to the cold .  No ,  I'm from Mexico ,  and before coming here ,  I was living in the tropics . 
Mm . 
Then ,  I arrived and it was like that .  In a month I'll be using coats already . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
No ,  I get very cold with everything .  So ,  it's good that I left also ,  because I don't know how I would've survived . 
No ,  I ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes .  I don't know how he survives .  I ,  whoever survives in Ithaca ,  I admire them ,  eh ,  because ,  for me ,  is an excess . 
Wow . 
But ,  is very good that you guys go ,  um ,  to good universities .  Because ,  he ,  eh ,  for a moment ,  he thought of going to Rochester Institute of Technology
Mm . 
and ,  and a friend of his ,  eh ,  started in ,  in Rochester . 
Mm . 
who ,  who was a very smart guy ,  also studying ,  eh ,  computer engineering .  And , 
Mm . 
and when they talked ,  they compared what they would have in their courses ,  what they gave Diego was much more intense , 
Ah ,  really ? 
much ,  much ,  more ,  yes ,  yes .  And ,  to the point that his friend ,  in Rochester ,  was even bored .  And ,  my son convinced him to transfer to Cornell
Okay . 
and ,  and after the first year ,  went over there . 
How nice . 
and ,  and he likes it much more ,  And ,  and Penn ,  well ,  sure ,  is one of the best universities in the country .  And , 
Mm . 
and without a doubt there's a comparable experience over there . 
yes . 
Eh ,  so there is where one sees the importance of going to a very good university where eh ,  where the courses will be intense . 
Mm . 
Eh ,  because although one doesn't appreciate it while you are in the courses with all that work ,  eh ,  it creates a certain mental discipline and a certain , 
eh ,  orientation of at what level one has to function .  And ,  and ,  it forces you to function at the most you can give . 
yes ,  that's what I also like , 
yes ,  yes
that you learn to function like that ,  with pressure ,  to do everything . 
yes . 
yes ,  it doesn't matter . 
And ,  to function at a level of excellence .  And ,  and be surrounded by excellent people ,  in a way that one functions at the level
of personal excellence as the norm . 
Mm . 
And the habit that creates ,  is ,  benefits you for the rest of your life . 
yes ,  I didn't see it like this ,  but it's true .  I agree ,  it's a level that you learn to live at ,  in a different way . 
Exactly ,  yes . 
Because yes ,  when I talk with my friends ,  I also see it like this ,  what they do with their time and everything ,  in other universities .   And if I
sometimes ,  a terrible loss of time ,  so ,  how can they not want to do more things ,  or how can they be so happy doing so little ?   And in exchange here ,  we do a lot ,  and if we have free time we want to do more
Exactly .   yes ,  eh ,  aha ,  hmm ,  hmm . 
For example ,  yes it happens ,  yes it's much more intense . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
It's good . 
yes ,  and aside from this ,  What do you think of Philadelphia ? 
I'm liking Philadelphia ,  not at the beginning because it was really cold and I almost never went out . 
yes . 
And ,  because it's very different .   The environment is really different to other cities that I know . 
Like which ? 
Like ,  I grew up in Mexico city . 
Ah ,  good ,  yes ,  yes ,  of course . 
And it's very ,  I say ,  it's really big ,  or ,  I went to New York ,  for example ,  New York is really different too . 
yes .   yes ,  yes . 
I remember in Mexico City ,  and here ,  in Philadelphia ,  it's like not so ,  it's not international . 
No ,  it's not international ,  no . 
Hmm .   And people aren't incredibly kind to you ,  for example ,  so ,  it's always ,  I don't know ,  I don't really know where to go ,  what are the safe areas and which ones aren't . 
So ,  I am still like this ,  getting used to the city .  I'm starting to like it much more
Oh
because I was here in summer
Mhm
So ,  in summer I enjoyed it a lot
Mm ,  see ,  let me give you the telephone number of my son ,  call him
yes ,  ok .  Let's see
yes ,  the ,  the cellular is
Mhm ,  mhm
 . 
Oh ,  ok .  I give you my cellular so that you give it to him anyway
Let  let me find something to note it down ,  ah
Mhm ,  how ,  how funny
yes ,  right ? 
what a coincidence
yes ,  yes ,  Mayra ,  what is your surname ?  Aha
And ,  ah ,  it is
Mhm mhm
 . 
Ok ,  great
And how about you ?  How many years have you been living in Philadelphia ? 
Ah ,  we've been here in Philadelphia since ninety seven . 
Okay . 
yes . 
And before ,  where did you live ? 
Before of ,  well ,  I was raised almost ,  I came from Cuba ,  but I was raised almost my whole life in the United States . 
Wow .  Okay . 
And ,  and I've lived in several places ,  especially ,  in the east coast . 
Okay . 
And ,  and I lived a bunch of years in Guatemala ,  that's where my kids were born . 
Ah ,  okay . 
yes ,  um ,  but ,  before coming here ,  we lived in the mountain parts of Virginia and Tennessee , 
Mm . 
because my parents lived there . 
Mm . 
Then ,  we spent a few years there . 
Wow . 
yes ,  yes ,  very different . 
yes ,  I believe it . 
yes ,  I tell my kids that they were raised in ,  in Guatemala ,  in the mountains in Virginia ,  and in Philadelphia ,  that you hardly find ,  three more contrasting places . 
yes ,  it's true .   And do you like Philadelphia ? 
I like it .   Eh ,  New York ,  well there's a lot of activity and everything ,  but it's not realistic to try to live in New York . 
No .   yes ,  this is true .   I like to go to New York to ,  like to be ,  wow ,  traveling and feeling like I'm in a completely unreal place for a day . 
Exact 
Hello ,  good evening ? 
Good evening . 
Ah ,  I'm Josefina from Philadelphia . 
My name is Annie ,  and I'm calling from Miami . 
Oh ,  Miami okay ,  how are you ? 
Fine fine ,  and you ? 
Ah ,  fine ,  thanks ,  here ,  well ,  watching so much news from from there not of you ,  but rather ,  of of the hurricanes and all that . 
yes . 
Ah Aha .  Do you already have several calls that you've made in this program ? 
Um ,  I think so .  I ,  I think that this is like the seventh
yes ,  something like that ,  right . 
yes . 
Aha .  Then they started ,  more or less the same ,  on the same days ,  right . 
yes ,  yes . 
Ah ,  okay .  I didn't understand the topic too well ,  but ,  I don't know . 
Me Me neither .  I hardly ever understand the accent in that recording . 
Mm Ah my daughter ,  yes ,  it puts I think that something of the personal ads ,  that if one meets people through personal ads ,  it would be . 
yes ,  of ,  of the Internet ,  by the Internet
Ah ,  ah
That ,  that was what I think they were saying ,  but
Right .  Oh ,  well ,  i don't know ,  i think a while ago you kinda payed more attention to that ,  ¿right ? 
Yes
And i think that on the ,  on two thousand and one ,  i started seeing a lot of people in internet groups and all that
I don't know how's it now ,  ¿have you met people with
No ,  uh ,  i
around there ? 
i have never done any of that personal ads stuff .  You know ,  neither over the internet ,  or newspapers ,  none of that
Right
I've met people through the internet ,  uh ,  bu i haven't ,  you know
Uh huh
Uh ,  but
On ,  on the other ,  with ,  on different concepts ,  like
yes
for example ,  from school or stuff like that ,  right ? 
Yes ,  or ,  or a club or something like that .  But not ,  no people ,  you know ,  from the personal ads ,  or any of that . 
Oh ,  right ,  i ,  right
And you ? 
I have met through the communities that said .  .  .  communities
Right ,  right
of MSN .  So ,  sometimes i looked and i got some group that interested me
Hmmmm
For example ,  poetry or something like that . 
Hmmmm
And yes ,  I knew some people ,  and we still write each other .   But not many ,  two or three people . 
yes
ah because there's a lot of jokers too . 
yes .   yes many people who don't know ,  so ,  so I don't believe in any of this
Hmm ,  you don't believe . 
No . 
And there are people who have even gotten married , 
yes yes
But you're single or married or ? 
Married . 
Ah yeah ,  yeah
And you ? 
Married and ,  many years ago ,  I got divorced .   I have a big son . 
Hmmmm
And eh ,  and well ,  now I live with my dad
wow
yes .   My dad's old so I'm with him here in Philadelphia .   And ,  well ,  and we've ,  we've gotten used to each other ,  so many years . 
Hm mm
yes ,  have you beeb there many years ? 
Eh ,  I came here from Puerto Rico ,  when I was like five years old . 
Ah ,  yes ,  well
So then eh ,  when I went to university ,  I went here to the university of Calahaseen ,  in Florida , 
Sure
I got married ,  then we returned .  We've been here now almost phew maybe ,  like thirteen years ? 
Oh how good is that
So i was out of Miami like five years . 
Ah .  And did you get married in Puerto Rico ,  or there ? 
A  over there .  No ,  we got married here in Miami . 
Aha
Because eh ,  my ,  my husband is American . 
Aha ,  aha
So ,  eh ,  Miami was easier for her family to come ,  and also my family from Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo . 
Sure ,  ah
And that ,  you know ,  we go married here
TON ,  do you have any children ? 
I have a girl of twenty two months and I'm pregnant ,  and I'm expecting for November ,  the next one . 
Oh ,  look how nice .  Will it be a boy or a girl ,  do you know ? 
I don't know ,  I don't know
Maybe it's a little boy ,  who knows .  Otherwise ,  another little girl
I'd like another girl
Ah ? 
I'd like another girl
Another female
yes
So cute .  They are attached to their mothers ,  right ? 
yes .  And also because I already have the clothes and everything for a girl ,  life turns easier
Oh ,  sure .  And they are friends ,  that
yes
growing together also
yes ,  but you know ,  whatever God provides .  I don't care
Right
being a healthy kid ,  that's all I ask for
Sure
If it is a boy ,  you know ,  it's the same to me ,  and I don't want to know if it is going to be boy or girl ,  because I know that if
let's say it is a
Hm mm
if they tell me it will be a boy ,  I may
Hm
you know ,  no ,  not that it depresses me ,  but that I don't know ,  that it
It changed ,  it changed your mind a bit ,  no ?   yes . 
yes ,  I pref  I know that as soon as ,  she's born ,  that I ,  it won't matter to me .   This is why I better prefer not
It made me remember when I had my son .   They all told me that it was a girl ,  even the doctor .   But there isn't a really perfect exam for this still ,  no . 
yes
What happened is that they gave me the ,  aye ,  what's it called ,  what the doctors use to hear . 
Aha
To ,  to hear the heart and this . 
Aha
So they listened and said ,  no ,  it's a girl because the beats are female .   And I bought everything ,  everything pink .   And when the baby was born .   And when the baby was born
everyone had to run and buy blue things ,  or yellow ,  white ,  no
Well ,  this is another thing .   Also ,  what I know ,  with the luck that I have ,  they say one thing and I will have the other
Ah yes ? 
So I prefer to wait ,  and be sure
To look for what you're going to buy . 
yes
Aha .   Sure .   Because the cradle it I will have it or this ,  no . 
yes ,  I ,  I have everything for a girl . 
Aha
But if we have a boy then I'll have to
Change the
yes ,  the crib and the room and all that because we only have one bedroom for the baby and the girl .  Eh ,  it won't change much .  Is more ,  the
clothes ,  I told my husband that I didn't care if the baby was in ,  you know ,  for the first month ,  or whatever ,  in pink things ,  or whatever . 
Okay
Because is just some pajamas ,  or whatever ,  but I'm not going to go crazy buying clothes either . 
Hm mm
You know ,  I have to
Sure .  They grow so fast ,  right . 
yes .  So my plan is that if it is a boy ,  then ,  you know ,  little by little we try to sell our daughter's old clothes . 
Sure
Then with that money buy new clothes ,  for boy . 
Ah ,  sure
And like that it becomes a little easier for us .  And not have to spend ,  you know ,  that expense . 
Ah Ah yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  is too much and then they grow up .  Well the little blankets you use them the same
yes
the clothes ,  and bed ,  and all that . 
yes ,  so
Aha
you know ,  and since I never knew with her if she was going to be a boy .  When I bought the bedding and all that ,  the crib
Hm
it was something that ,  it didn't matter which color it was . 
Oh perfect .  So now it can combine ,  however ,  however it can . 
yes ,  and ,  and it's true ,  one can't ,  one can't whenever it needs ,  you know ,  for the  parents is more important for the bedroom to look nice ,  whatever .  The baby doesn't need any of that . 
Aha ,  and when I was ,  they are going to grow ,  they just need love . 
So yes
and tenderness and care . 
And food you know ,  so
oh and
I don't
also ,  is it really hot there ?  Now ? 
Yes ,  it is .  Usually it is a bit cool lets say ,  in December ,  it can be in January ,  a bit cool but I want to say that we have around seventy degrees , 
around seventy ? 
That's nice ,  yes . 
You know ,  but it's more than that ,  no . 
Oh okay ,  have you been here in Philadelphia ? 
And we too ,  hm hmm .  Never .  I've never seen the snow either . 
Oh ,  oh ,  boy .  Look at that .  Did you go to the university ? 
Oh ,  special education . 
Oh ,  that's cool .  You didn't go to work today ,  right ? 
No ,  I worked for a few years .  And ,  eh ,  I worked for five ,  six years .  But then my husband got a job ,  and his job
Hm
his job ,  he still has this job ,  is from half past twelve to nine
Hm mm
from Thursday to Monday
Oh
And is free on Tuesday and Wednesday .  And what happened to us ?  that for a whole year I didn't see him and he didn't see me ,  because
Hm
when I was free ,  he was working
You had opposite schedules
So ,  yes ,  so ,  after that
He worked in the afternoon
decided that ,  you know ,  I would quit working ,  because this way we could have a marriage .  We don't have money ,  but we have a marriage
So
Sure .  A couple must be in contact ,  close contact and communication
yes
It's not just a little while ,  it's much more .  Other things ,  like a baby ,  or
yes ,  so
Ah
you know ,  it was a little hard but ,  you know ,  and specially living here ,  it is very expensive ,  very expensive
ye
yes
Are you in Miami ? 
No ,  I'm the south ,  I'm in Homestead
Oh
That it's more south of Miami ,  before getting in the cays
Oh ,  okay ,  okay
But ,  many people does not know ,  you know ,  where is Homestead ,  so ,  we always say it's Miami ,  But the difference ,  let's say ,  we are
from 30 or 40 miles to the south of Downtown Miami ,  but
Mmm
You never realize that you are from one city to another ,  let's say ,  because it's
You have everything there ,  with buildings and houses
And house ,  and roads ,  and you never realize that
Ir like you were inside Miami
yes ,  yes
All the time ,  is Miami Spring ,  is it near ? 
It would be ,  at the north from where we are ,  Miami Spring would be like 50 miles from here
Oh ,  okay ,  Well ,  I don't know ,  I have been in Miami ,  but I went as a tourist and well ,  then
yes
you are always in the downtown ,  or in a beach
Yes
Miami Beach ,  but it's tranquil there then ,  no ? 
Eh ,  not too much .  For this reason I wanted to go to another place ,  because ,  we have a lot ,  eh I don't want to say Mexicans ,  but that is what we have .  And this is not important ,  but they are a lot of the people that work with ,  in
Hm
in ,  ay ay ay
in the country
Yes ,  and for this reason there is a lot not much ruckus ,  but ,  but ,  it is not a
Hm ,  ah yes
It is not very tranquil
A lot ,  yes ,  the population is big
One second
Ah ,  but good ,  little by little truth
Permit me ,  yes yes ,  God would like ,  we
Yes ,  little by little
We are going to move starting now ,  because also the ,  the houses are expensive
Hm ,  I don't believe
and we don't have patio .  So you know ,  when we bought this house ,  we didn't know that we could have kids .  We were married for twelve years already
Ah . 
We thought that we were never going to have kids .  Then two weeks after buying the house ,  we noticed that ,  you know ,  I was pregnant with a girl
Ah ,  cool ,  what a surprise
So ,  we have three bedrooms
Good evening
Oh ,  good evening ,  good evening
¿How are you ? 
Fine ,  thank you ,  fine ,  thanks
¿And where are you calling from ? 
Oh ,  I'm calling from New York
Oh ,  ok ,  Norma here from Atlanta ,  Georgia
Atlanta ,  Georgia ,  right ,  look ,  uh
Right ,  not Crisna ,  please ,  no
I didn't hear very well what the subject was ,  what we're going to talk about ,  uh ,  uh ,  what ,  what we have to talk about
About the dates ,  dating
Oh
About dating
Oh ,  like dates ,  like dating ,  right ,  right
Yes ,  uh ,  say ,  that's what we had to talk about ,  at first i didn't understand either
No ,  because he/she was talking ,  it was like a machine ,  it was speaking Spanish like
yes
with an English accent ,  ¿do you know what i mean ? 
yeah ,  no ,  its
uh ,  uh
It's the ,  it's the machine ,  I think ,  or it's a person .   Someone who doesn't speak Spanish well so
Well ,  a
You can't understand
It seems like a machine ,  who learned Spanish in a book ,  you know ? 
aha ,  more or less like that
No ,  originally in the house or something .   But ,  well ,  well ,  they say we have to talk about dates . 
yes ,  they say which were the best and good ,  hmm ,  worst dates that you had or something like this ,  or ,  how have dates changed over the years ? 
yeah but I haven't had a date in a while ,  Well ,  I haven't had very good dates ,  however .   Eh ,  I've had many more bad ones than good ones .   But the thing is that in the date
there's one ,  eh ,  I haven't been on a date recently because sometimes when you go out with someone you know really well ,  like a friend ,  a friend ,  right
sure
and you ,  you have a date with other people it's sometimes difficult ,  you know ? 
aha yes ,  I've never been on dates ,  really when ,  like I entered a religious community ,  and they don't do dates there . 
Okay ,  okay ,  I get it ,  I get it
No and now but I know about these dates and that now they've changed .   That before they were in the newspapers ,  the personals
well they do that now too ,  but now it's more done on the internet ,  right . 
Oh yes ,  yes ,  now ,  eh ,  eh , 
now everything is more modern
yes ,  well it's not ,  it's ,  it's a good business now
ah yes ,  yes
because people pay a lot of money for this now
aha
you understand ,  that you sucrube ,  you subscribe to one of these ,  one of these from ther Internet . 
aha
And you have to pay lots of money ,  do you understand .  But the thing is that they charge you . 
eh ,  yes
they charge less to ,  to the men than to the women ,  they charge more to the men
like that ,  ah I didn't know that
yes ,  for ,  for the thing ,  because ,  because there are many women and less men . 
that's why
aha ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
ah it's just as well that I'm married then . 
For ,  that's why ,  because the thing is that they need more men ,  do you understand ? 
ah ,  yes
Because for every man there are like five or six women ,  something like that . 
ah it's good I already found my man
so when ,  when you say that you're a man ,  sometimes it says that it's free for men .  for a while or something like that
ah yes ,  I didn't know that
yes because Because the more women that get a date with a man righ ? 
aha
so they tell it to other women . 
mhm
And there is more ,  more business . 
ah ,  yes
Do you understand ,  if women get on and don't need any ,  any dates .  So there is not much business for that ,  for them
sure
That means that they do whatever to bring more men to the situation ,  you see
aha
Well it's the same ,  that this call that we're making right now . 
mhm
They say ,  they said before that they want more men to make calls because there are many more women that make calls than men .  ah ,  what can I tell you . 
yes some ,  sometimes there are some advantages because people don't have a partner at least eh ,  they find
eh ,  no yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  in eh . 
Or friends
yes ,  and so ,  so I ,  and you get to know something from the person time , 
aha
Because a previous person the woman goes out to a party .  or goes to a bar or something like that
mhm
and you don't know who that person is ,  you don't know anything about that person . 
yes
But in the ah , 
mhm
the ,  online dating ,  or something like that ,  at least they take your information and they try to  match you with someone that shares your same interests
aha
similar to you ,  do you understand , 
sure ,  aha
Maybe you like sports and the other person doesn't like them or you enjoy going to the park or something like that and the other person absolutely hates it ,  do you follow me ? 
mhm yes
that's why ,  at least they
but ,  you have to be careful too because sometimes ,  if you ,  for example personally meet someone from the Internet ,  you
yes ,  oh ,  yes
many times ,  yes
they have bad intentions
some people ,  you don't even know how they are
They have bad intentions bad intentions and you ,  they say things that are not true . 
aha
It's all lies ,  you see . 
yes ,  that's right
do you understand ,  but ,  oh ,  but at least you have their picture in the internet . 
aha
so ,  you can look at their pictures
they upload a fake photograph , 
Oh ,  well ,  there are lots of women that upload pictures of when they were younger
oh ,  yes ,  yes . 
And they are ten ,  fifteen years older now ,  or even twenty years older and they show you the pictures of when they were twenty years younger . 
aha
Do you understand ,  when you meet them in person ,  they are a bit fatter and stuff like that ,  do you understand ? 
yes ,  sometimes ,  many times ,  it's dangerous to solve
well ,  oh ,  oh ,  there's danger in everything ,  what can I say . 
um mhm aha
but sometimes ,  there's more than in other parts ,  in other parts ,  do you understand ?  You have to be careful ,  you are not close to the ,  hurricane Rita and all that ? 
the hurricane ,  n o ,  well ,  God is great ,  it hasn't happened here ,  no hurricanes ,  the first one ,  Katrina ,  took place in the North of Georgia . 
aha
no ,  it's like ,  it caused no damage there
In the North of Georgia
yes ,  in the North of Georgia
just a few ,  very few ,  but no ,  no
um yes ,  but the other one ,  Rita ,  it passed right in front of Texas ,  so we are not outside the hurricane zone . 
You are not ,  okay ,  that's better because one of my brothers lives in Florida and last year ,  they had a lot of hurricanes but ,  not a big one like the ones that have recently happened . 
yes ,  that's right ,  it's been a very busy season
oh yes ,  Katrina and Rita was more powerful than Katrina . 
appalling ,  with those hurricanes ,  aha
they were saying that is forming in Puerto Rico yes ,  but they don't know why the hurricanes there start in the ocean ,  you understand me ? 
yes aha
then it come to land ,  when they get to land they fall but before they do a bit of damage . 
yes ,  yes ,  I mean that's very dangerous ,  no ,  but
is that nothing can be done . 
You have to take precautions
for ,  I'm going to tell you something ,  before when there were hurricanes ,  right , 
yes
like my brother in Florida when they would say hurricanes there ,  they didn't even pay attention to it ,  okay ,  okay But now ,  after they saw what happened with Katrina ,  right , 
Now everybody gets scared
you saw ,  you saw the people that were getting out of Texas You saw ,  more ,  more than a thousand people have gotten out of Texas ,  already . 
yes certainly , 
there's a reason why they are taking it more seriously ,  before they didn't take is so seriously
sure because before they weren't as destructive
They weren't so ,  exactly ,  Katrina in
mm
Katrina showed that they are dangerous ,  because now ,  now those people when they tell them there's a hurricane . 
mm
to ,  to leave your home and leave ,  now the people leave ,  they leave ,  eh ,  they leave that there behind ,  You understand me ? 
hmm
You take the family and you go ,  you know what I mean
yes
But hey ,  can I tell you ,  this is life ,  you know ? 
sure ,  there's danger everywhere in this world . 
aha ,  yes but
yes there are different kinds of dangers ,  it's a danger from other people or other living beings ,  there are dangers from natural disasters . 
Or ,  yes ,  this is life ,  what can I tell you ?   I sometimes look at nature and how the animals live and all this ,  there's danger out there too
aha sure
for the animals and all this and if there's fire ,  and all the things that happen . 
hmm
that this is live in general ,  you know .   You have to be careful about all these things . 
hmm
yes but ,  talking about dates
yes we have to talk about dates
yes well like I told you the new thing of the Internet .   And ,  sometimes there are thins that ,  Lava life ,  Lava ,  I don't know if you have this in Georgia
aha
Lava ,  lava
Lava Life
Yeah ,  a big one ,  this is really big . 
yes ,  this is I saw the propaganda on the television always happens
ah yes ,  yes this is what I said ,  here in New York you see ,  how things go everywhere .   Going on the bus and when they go to
cans and things like this ,  eh
aha
you see ,  in another ,  shops and places you see Lava life
ah yes ,  there's a lot of propaganda ,  true
that ,  that yes ,  yes this is really big and all that . 
sure because it seems like now it's really like society has advanced so much and society has advanced so much so everything has different
I know aspirations and I know ,  they don't find a partner very quickly .   They don't have ,  the postpone , 
yeah well the thing is that ,  yes ,  exactly ,  the thing that happened to me too is that there are many women and men who
who ,  who work
aha ,  yes for this ,  it's not everyone's goal
And ,  and , 
their goals aren't focused on getting married ,  before it was like this ,  before it was different . 
yes ,  and the thing
but now the people are
yes ,  and ,  the time that you
like they say career oriented
And the time that it takes to do all the things that you have to do , 
aha
study ,  you have to go to the job that you do this ,  and this ,  and the other ,  you understand me
mm
And also that the things that the people have changed a lot too ,  that the people . 
aha
are saying that if they want a ,  husband or a wife . 
aha
they look at certain qualities that they are looking for ,  you understand me ?  and certain ,  that they are looking for ,  before they didn't do that before there was a woman and a man ,  and that's it ,  you know ,  but now already
yes now like you say the people have become more picky
one is yes ,  yes ,  more picky exactly ,  exactly ,  more picky more and ,  and they have good reason to do that ,  understand ? 
aha
because ,  yes because I thought a little more picky because the thing is that at least is looking for something that is more solid ,  more information , 
a foundation ,  of the person ,  understand ?  not only is another person understand ? 
mm
but you know ,  it has certain ,  certain things that you can look for ,  you understand me ?  understand that you accept and you don't accept ,  understand me ?  But ,  that's the life together eh , 
eh ,  how can I tell you . 
Sure that's why I suppose that there are more of those dating those on the internet have become very popular right , 
Oh ,  yeah ,  oh yeah . 
because people no they open their computer and there they can find can meet with other people ,  talk with other people
yes they put ,  put the same interest that you have , 
aha
And the interest that the other person has and how they say that they have something more religious ,  they're looking for a kind of person who has more religion inside ,  you know ? 
hmmm hmm
They put this there ,  things that ,  you accept of don't accept .   Exac ,  and so ,  so well ,  it's a reason ,  it's good ,  you know ? 
Are you married ? 
I ,  I ,  I yes ,  I'm married . 
yes ,  ah ,  okay
I've been married for many years ,  but ah ,  but before I wasn't married I was divorced ,  once ,  and after I got married . 
oh ,  okay
so ,  so even if I'm not dating right now but ,  in the future ,  no ,  I don't hope to do this in the future either . 
yes
Because I'm getting a bit older and I don't have a lot of time for any other thing .   because I'm also married ,  you know ? 
sure
so ,  I'm not looking but I observe ,  I'm observing what I see on other places like you say ,  an advertisement ,  on the internet ,  all this . 
hmm
because there's a dating ,  dating ,  you know ? 
aha
date ,  and date and date ,  and something like that .   once that
yes ,  now ,  it's ,  no ,  there are many ,  many ways to do these things ,  no
yes ,  yes oh well it's business ,  it's a big business ,  business right now ,  you know , 
yes like how now it's all a business ,  so
everything's a business ,  and with ,  with ,  we are ,  this ,  we are in the age of information
hmm
I don't know if you've heard ,  heard that ,  the age of information ,  know what I mean ?  that you ,  you ,  uhm ,  get information real quick ,  yes
sure ,  now everything ,  everything
about anything ,  anything at all you want ,  you go to internet information
even cell phones can go to internet ,  that way you can without having to go to your personal computer ,  laptop ,  whatever
yeah ,  oh ,  yes ,  oh ,  yes ,  of course ,  of course ,  of cou 
now you open your phone ,  and if you have a phone ,  well ,  connected to internet
not only that ,  but you can look at the other person ,  and you call them and they take a picture ,  and when you're looking at the
cellular ,  cell phone
you see
the picture is there live if you sen  you're talking ,  right ,  and they're showing how it looks and all that

good people there or not .

As you like .   If you wish to start ,  I'll listen to you . 
Okay ,  well you start then ,  and I'll listen . 
Ok .  Well ,  eh ,  let me see ,  what are the best and the worse dates ,  I think the worse dates are when I spend
some holly days without my girl
Aha
because since I have joint custody with her ,  well ,  mm ,  yes ,  when I don't have her with me I get really sad
Aha
And you ?  Hello ? 
Aha
yes ,  and you ,  what are your best and worst dates ? 
Well  , the worst dates are ,  ah ,  when it comes ,  ah ,  the Mother's Day ,  Christmas ,  New Years Eve ,  my mom's birthday .  She is in Puerto Rico and I am here
yes ,  my mom is in Puerto Rico also
And the best ones wre three years ago ,  ah ,  that I have spent with her ,  ah ,  thank God ,  I spent Christmas ,  New Yera's Eve and her birthday ,  that was three years ago
Oh ,  really ?  How good ,  and do you go often to Puerto Rico ? 
Oh ,  I have gone ,  these last three years ,  I have gone about two or three times a month
Oh ,  wow
And you ? 
MM ,  I ,  ah ,  it's been too long since I last went to my little island .  Since ninety three
Wow
yes ,  that was the year when my father died ,  and I haven't gone back since then
Where are you from ? 
I was born in San Juan
Oh ,  I'm from Arecibo . 
From Arecibo ,  yes I have .  No ,  I ,  I have friends and relatives all over the island ,  as I also have eh ,  family in ,  in many parts of the east coast
Aha . 
but I don't remember having many ,  yes some family in Chicago . 
Oh . 
yes ,  I've met many friends here in Colorado that have come from there ,  from Chicago . 
Mm . 
And ,  you like it a lot over there ,  where is really cold in winter ,  right ? 
Oh ,  yes ,  man . 
yes ,  I can imagine . 
And especially the snow . 
Here it snows but not as much as it snowed before in the eighties ,  here it snowed that it ended I think that since the earth has been warming up more ,  well it doesn't snow that much . 
Aha
but yes ,  eh ,  sometimes we've gotten some really bad storms with tornadoes and things like that
Oh ,  yes ,  yes , yes ,  yes . 
and ,  well 
That's also the ,  of ,  ah ,  of this time also is the bad thing the storms that we've been having like
what I went through on nine eleven ,  now that is this season of Katrina that's also ah real bad times . 
yes ,  it melts now that it's going really strong to Texas and to Louisiana
And ,  and now are
yes ,  it was horrible . 
Horrible ,  horrible ,  horrible . 
Here we have refugees in these zones in fact ,  close to where I live ,  we have like a thousand
Aha . 
who are staying .   They brought them to a military base because close to where I live there is
Aha . 
an air force base
Aha . 
so there are many of them here
Oh ,  here in Chicago too . 
but I haven't been able to see them yet ,  I haven't seen them because I don't know what happens when they're put they're ,  if they go out or not ,  well I don't know who they are
Aha . 
but it's such a shame what's happening to them . 
But here in Chicago there came some ,  eh ,  I think they caught a plane and ,  ah ,  it was fully chartered
yes . 
full of refugees ,  and they gave them the ticket so they could come here to Chicago
Oh . 
but it's been really really bad because they are having collections but
yes . 
some ,  the poor people are those who are giving ,  but the rich aren't moving a single cent . 
So it is ,  but one day they will have to pay for their avarice
Hmm ,  hmm ,  hmm . 
because I really believe in this . 
Aha . 
Well yes ,  and regarding the internet ,  Do you connect to the internet a lot ?

Hmm .

Oh ,  still a baby . 
still ,  yes she's lovely ,  I enjoy her company a lot but I would have liked ,  in a way ,  sometimes ,  to be younger ,  even now
Hmm . 
eh ,  sure ,  it's like a capacity to appreciate more the privilege of being a father . 
Aha . 
I love being a dad . 
Aha . 
I'm fascinated .   Well she's here with me ,  because her mom and I are divorced ,  and she's with me three times a week ,  all week
Oh .

What are you playing ?   Barbie ? 
Eh ,  we play a lot of things ,  she likes me to run her all over the house and this and ,  yes

And she's always crazy ,  she's crazy because to know the island
Oh ,  she doesn't know ,  she still doesn't know Puerto Rico . 
the little island that we N  no ,  but yeah ,  soon we will be able to go to get to know the island . 
Oh ,  that's good . 
yes ,  well on the internet ,  I really do a lot of things because I've also taken classes on the internet
Hmm . 
and I always look for information on something ,  I find it on the internet . 
Aha . 
It's a ,  it's helped me a lot in many things ,  also in the chats ,  well I've met good people ,  but this is to know more how to know more about
only friendship ,  to look for a girlfriend ,  something ,  well I don't think that it's really ideal because on the internet it's
Aha ,  aha .   Dangerous . 
it's dangerous ,  they lie a lot ,  the people are disguised
Ah .   Aha . 
and well ,  no ,  I don't have much confidence ,  in fact when I thought that I could meet good people or something like that ,  well bad things happened and disillusion ,  and
I said ,  no ,  better not . 
yes ,  because ah
And , 
my friend met a guy on the internet and he asked her personal questions and
yes . 
ah ,  and she answered and he asked questions and she answered like she was really messed
yes . 
and he left her in the street ,  I don't know how he did it to ,  how is it ?   To steal the bank account
Don't tell me . 
and the account number and everything ,  he took everything . 
My God . 
I don't know how ,  but he stole it . 
Wow ,  wow . 
yes ,  and I told her . 
An ,  it's that she gave too much information . 
She ,  aha ,  because relaxing like this she ,  she said ,  give me your account number ,  I'll give you my account number
and we'll get to know each other ,  we'll get married and be happy
Ah ,  crazy . 
and he said that ,  that he had a good job ,  that this ,  other ,  that he was rich and she told him too that she had money
and when ,  all of a sudden she was blinded by everything that he said and he left her in the street . 
Wow . 
You see ? 
This is terrible . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
yes ,  but it's true ,  these things happen on the Internet ,  you have to be really careful . 
For the
No ,  and I prefer to meet the person ,  there in front and
Aha . 
know if the person is really good or not because ,  hmm ,  because on the internet ,  it's really easy to lie and hide how you are and
Aha ,  aha ,  aha . 
No ,  this no
You don't know if ,  especially us ,  as women ,  we're not ,  we don't know if we're dealing with a rapist ,  with a killer
Exactly . 
with a
And yes ,  there are ,  well ,  tons on the internet . 
Aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  and
Ah sure ,  I ,  I have a lot ,  I like the internet a lot in the informative sense ,  and it's educational and that but in many things like that I take the body
E 
and even if I've tried a group of Puerto Ricans and
Hmm . 
and I liked it ,  because you know the culture and things are going in your country . 
Aha . 
But when it's a chat room that has a lot
Aha . 
it's good ,  but when you're in one of them alone ,  one to one
Aha . 
well like that frightens me now ,  now I don't like it at all . 
No ,  it's a danger too . 
yes ,  yes danger 
You can't give him information on where you live . 
yes . 
what ,  what brand of car you have ,  where you work because he's capable of showing up where you ,  where you live
yes ,  exactly .  And I have found people that ask  ,  that ask a lot and
Aha . 
then they start making lots of personal questions and I don't like that they make many personal questions because first of all ,  I protect myself very well and
and the other thing is because since I have a small girl well I don't want to give them too much information that would put her in da  ,  in danger . 
Aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha . 
So ,  well I stop it there . 
Aha ,  aha . 
A bd ,  mm ,  but I do speak of my baby like that but I don't get into much detail
Mhm ,  mhm . 
I always like to talk a lot about my daughter .  I love her very much . 
Aha .  And where did you meet your wife ? 
Well I love her my wife ,  I met her right here in Denver .  She came eh ,  for a job that they brought her from there she's an engineer in
of food processing
Aha . 
so ,  I met her in a park ,  I used to play volley ball a lot
Aha
I used to play ,  so she saw me playing in the park ,  we introduced each other ,  then we went out ,  we became good friends and finally decided to marry
And were you married for a long time ? 
No ,  not really ,  she had a very strong temperament and I am the opposite ,  I hate fights and arguments
Aha
I don't like those at all
Mm
so ,  well ,  but at least we have a good relation as parents ,  to our daughter
Aha ,  aha
and the girl is happy
Mhm
she never
Hello ? 
Good evening ,  Milgred from Connecticut . 
Hello ? 
Hello ? 
Hello ,  pardon ,  what's your name ? 
Milgred ,  eh ,  I live in Nortward Connecticut
Ah ,  ok ,  ok ,  yes I'm Jose .  I live in Phi
Pardon ? 
I ,  my name is Jose and I live in Philadelphia . 
Oh ,  OK
Yes ,  yes ,  And and I ,  I I didn't hear the topic too well then ,  I don't know ,  what the topic is about
The topic ,  is if you've bought something on the computer ,  and the companies that call you offering products and things . 
Ah
that offer you trips ,  and offer you free things ,  if you've bought something on the internet ,  of there ,  of those offers that they call you to offer you .  That tell you that you will have
some vacations ,  eh ,  for such amount ,  and is free ,  nothing is free ,  at the end . 
Ah ,  I mean ,  and do you buy a lot of things on the Internet ,  or no ? 
No ,  I don't ,  I don't . 
No ? 
My daughters use it ,  and my boyfriend uses it ,  but not me . 
Ah Ah ,  no
I don't buy   I don't ,  I don't trust the Internet too much , 
Ah
for me is not too
Yes I ,  well now I've already started buying lots of textbooks ,  on ,  on the computer And ,  yes for me it has worked ,  it has worked out very well . 
For example ,  there are many college textbooks ,  that are super expensive ,  expensive ,  in other words books that for example ah ,  the accounting book this semester ,  cost
how do you call it ,  I don't know ,  maybe one hundred fifty dollars . 
Oh
And then I bought it on the Internet ,  for ,  like fifty dollars
Yes ,  my boyfriend has bought equipments of ,  he is a  DJ and has bought light equipments ,  and music system equipments ,  but I don't ,  I don't use it .  My
my daughters buy  the only thing I've bought have been tickets for Jet Blue and that ,  and American Airlines But apart from that I don't use it for
for any other product ,  no ,  I don't like it . 
Ah no
I don't feel like too safe ,  in information ,  especially when they ask ,  family name ,  and all that nonsense no ,  I don't like it
Yes ,  no , 
and ,  and the PIN card names ,  that I don't like . 
Yes no ,  but also ,  what I think ,  what it is ,  is ,  is something that I think that in the future there will be a problem
enormous ,  because one knows that so many people that are using the internet ,  and don't know that eventually there will be a problem because there's so much information ,  and that information is so valuable . 
Yeah
It seems to me that someone might say ,  look ,  I'm going to get in here ,  here in one of those companies' networks . 
No there have already been ,  already there have been ,  there have been like three people that have stolen the In  there was a guy that worked for one of the banks
Aha
big ,  so he collected information on thousands of clients ,  and made purchases on all the sites . 
Hmm ,  yes yes ,  this
And he stole millions ,  millions of dollars . 
Yes ,  you hear about this ,  every now and then ,  and
But they offer many good things . 
yes ,  it's true ,  it's true .   Yes ,  everything has its
And at good prices ,  because my niece buys ,  items
Ah
She ,  she buys clothes ,  to
And she buys it
for the ,  yes ,  for ,  he has like a shop and everything personally by her ,  and she sells silver items , 
Hmmmm
and she buys them through the Internet ,  and it works really well .   It works really well
Ah
But I especially ,  I don't use it . 
Yes ,  in general you can find really good prices there because ,  if you think
And the in ,  I don't like to go on ebay because on ebay you put ,  once you open
Ah no
sometimes you're just paying more than ,  than the thing is really worth ,  because
Yes ,  ebay is a little dangerous ,  I bought a computer in ebay and it turns out that the person ,  because she bought a laptop
and it turns out that the person to whom she bought it was illegal ,  it was an illegal activity ,  right ?  so she sent me the check ,  but she never sent me the
the computer
And here also ,  a man bought a car ,  and he gave ,  he was asked five thousand dollars in advance
Aha
advance ,  so he sent the five thousand dollars ,  and he never saw the car ,  the guy didn't exist ,  the company
Oh ,  oh
There was nothing at all ,  he went to the place where it was supposed to be ,  he went there with the police
Oh
when they arrived to the place ,  it was empty ,  absolutely empty ,  it was the right address but it had never been occupied by that person
Oh
So he was swindled ,  and lost five thousand dollars .  So ,  that's why
yes
you have to be
No ,  that's sad ,  because just figure ,  loosing five thousand dollars like that ,  right ? 
yes Hmm mm
it's hard
Five thousand dollars that you know you won't recover ,  because if you send a money order ,  once it has been cahsed ,  how can you find that person ? 
yes yes .  No ,  what happened to my mother ,  is that she saw the person ,  and then she called the police , 
of ,  of the State ,  and also to the local ,  she called all the polices and the FBI also ,  of course ,  but she said 'with so many cases they have to deal with .  . '
can you imagine ,  they won't have time to get into a computer case because the computer was also worth five hundred dollars
Right
So ,  the FBI won't be getting into a case like that ,  where it's about five hundred dollars ,  and ,  uh ,  nothing important ,  ¿right ?  ,  so ,  the FBI didn't go in ,  but the local police
went to see the ,  uh ,  the person and then i imagine they threatened him ¿right ?  ,  so they told him "look ,  if you give back the stolen money to everyone" ,  because that was
uh ,  that was a theft that included maybe ten people ,  fifteen people ,  because he said he had several computers for sale
And it was the same one ,  that he was selling to everyone
Right ?  ,  i think it's a computer that didn't existed .  I mean ,  yes ,  he said ,  he said something like "i have six computers" ,  and the truth ,  so ,  everyone thought the price was great ,  there are several
that bought ,  and he received the checks and cashed them and never sent anything ,  but yeah ,  hu ,  my mom called the police and
she hoped that ,  they got there at seven a . m .  and i imagine ,  i imagine they gave him a pretty rough talk
and he returned her money
He paid ,  he paid
yes ,  yes ,  my mom was able to recover the money
Thank god ,  that's a miracle because
Yeah ,  right ? 
you know ,  so many things you get into ,  that later on they never give you your money back
Right ?  ,  that was only a miracle because ,  uh ,  and the thing is that that man didn't do it right ,  because ,  uh ,  ebay had all of his personal information
right ,  and there's
Those are the ,  the half dumb ones that ,  like i say ,  the half dumb burglars
No ,  no ,  no ,  that's a
They give you all the information and they don't know they're going to catch them later ,  fools
Right .  No ,  he was an ignorant here too .  Of course ,  mom was very lucky ,  she didn't suffer
bad experiences in general .  I ,  once ,  applied for ,  I didn't even apply for it .  I was thinking of applying for a university .  And then I said ,  oh
I was sent a letter saying that ,  obviously ,   I wrote to them and told them I was interested in applying for their university so please send information ,  right ? 
So ,  all they knew about me was ,  I don't know ,  my name ,  my e mail ,  birth date
Yes ,  that's why they ask for all your personal data ,  and they use it to make it naughty
Yes ,  no ,  no .  Yes ,  but ,  but then ,  but they didn't have aything ,  nor the social security number or anything ,  and then they sent me a letter saying that
oh ,  there was a hacker who entered ,  who got in thir system and stole all the information .  So I said ,  luckily , 
no ,  no ,  no ,  it was nothing important ,  really
Oh my goodness
So ,  it's dangerous .  I think that ,  it seems to me that it will be a problem in the future ,  but now ,  the benefits are so much
But ,  some people are lucky and some ain't .  Because ,  I know people who buy twenty thousand
No ,  that's right
bullshit in the Internet ,  and they have no problem
Yes ,  that's true
And I know other people who ,  forget it .  ,  they are robed even the social security on the Internet
Oh ,  it's true ,  luck matters ,  because there are some poor guys who no matter what they do they always have bad luck ,  but
I don't know ,  some days ,  I  ,  I ,  eventually ,  eh ,  the thing is that
Well ,  I lived that
if you think about it ,  every year ,  that's what  I feel ,  every year it is unlikely .  In general it is quite improbable that there is
a ,  that someone get you ,  enters your computer ,  and your credit card ,  and find information about you ,  and use it
The problem is that you ,  for fifty years ,  every year ,  you take some risks
yeah
and I think that in the end ,  the probability of that happening to you during your lifetime ,  lets say ,  in fifty years ,  it really is ,  it's pretty high ,  really
you start using the credit cards at eighteen ,  twenty years old , 
Hm mm
and between twenty and seventy years , 
Well ,  but
I think that eventually ,  something is going to happen ,  that's true
I hope that they keep improvising ,  the security issue ,  for the computers because you user your PIN and they find ways to collect your PIN .  You
use the information ,  you know ,  it's different ,  they are always finding ways to break ,  the ,  the ,  but picture this ,  I believe that they find ways to ,  within all those
they find it there ,  they get someone that is trying to find wasy to take advantage of all those inventions . 
That's right .  No ,  and criminals have a very big incentive for getting your information because
Yes ,  yes ,  they've got a master mind
Yes ,  that's right ,  that's right .  No ,  and oh ,  yes ,  the problem with that is that they have this amazing geniuses that work on that ,  it's a shame actually ,  but
for example ,  in computers ,  there are lots of geniuses out there . 
Yeah hm mm
sure ,  so ,  that way ,  that no ,  that ,  that' that's the ,  the only type of oh ,  they consider it like a challenge
Yes ,  they find out everything ,  they find
yes they can
everything ,  well ,  oh ,  they are all involved in
yes
in everything ,  there's always a thief everywhere ,  because if you look at ,  uh ,  at the same ones ,  there's always one that steals ,  because he gathers information from
others ,  and sells stock that was fake ,  they sell fake stuff on the computers ,  every website sells something fake
Uh huh ,  yes ,  yes ,  no ,  it's true ,  it's true
Sometimes they even pick you up at the street ,  they tell you "look ,  I'm selling you a tv" ,  when you go to their house ,  the TV has a
stone [is a brick] ,  because a bunch of people has gone through buying cheap things on the street
Yes ,  yes ,  it's true
So i ,  i think that the computer is a little bitm uh ,  it provides a lot of services ,  information that i think should be used mostly for
research and stuff like that ,  not to sell anything or be giving your personal information around there
Hi ,  good afternoon , 
I'm Josefina ,  Who is that ? 
I'm Miguel Angel
Hi ,  Miguel Angel ,  How are you ? 
Very well ,  very well ,  and you ,  Josefina ?  where are you ? 
Here in Philadelphia ,  do you remember that we spoke and that
Ah ,  fina
That you were at University yes , 
Hi ,  how are you ?  ,  ah It's that you said Josefina ,  sure ,  and for a moment I didn't ,  hi what a coincidence no ,  tho have met again ,  that's good
Oy ,  what truth ,  what a thing ,  strange
what joy ,  yes
that's good ,  yes ,  would you do me a favor and explain to me ,  what did that man said because I didn't understand a thing
Look I didn't understand very well either ,  but I think I think that it had to ,  it has to do with tele sales I mean
oh , 
With that that they call you on the phone and they want to sell something
aha ah ,  OK ,  because he says something
yes , 
That if you have something by phone or through the Internet
yes ,  yes , 
And it must be if you have bought things ,  no
yes ,  yes ,  I imagine ,  exactly ,  I imagine it has to do with
or if they've sold it
Long distance shopping I mean ,  well ,  through the telephone ,  no
Sure
or through the Internet ,  because of all of that ,  so
Oh ,  well ,  I've bought ,  I have ,  yes ,  yes ,  things like
yes ,  but through the Internet or through the phone ? 
Well ,  I ,  in and ,  oh ,  ebay ,  do you know about ebay
yes ,  sure ,  ebay ,  yes ,  yes
aha ,  I bought a book
mhm ,  mhm
yes ,  I bought ,  I've bought several things
A Psychology one
I mean ,  no ,  I believe it was for work ,  sometimes you
I mean ,  it was a psychotherapy book
aha ,  something like that ,  we were taking some courses
aha
oh ,  they asked us to read some articles ,  so
I see
You can find that book at thirty five dollars but I got it there in two dollars . 
Look ,  you know
And , 
Do you know this website ,  it's called ,  the one that you use to  look for used books
A D O L
No ,  A   D   D   A   L   L ,  add all
oh ,  yes
Do you know it ? 
No ,  no ,  I hadn't seen that one
Well ,  write it down ,  it's three w's
aha
dot A   D  D   A   L   L
aha
add all dot com
that's good ,  okay
So ,  in this website you can search ,  so ,  what it does is that it searches in all the ,  all the bookstores that sell <foreign lang="English" online <foreign used books
mhm
they look for the book ,  the place with the lower price
oh ,  cool
I mean ,  they look it up for you
well
She looks ,  she looks in all these bookstores on line
she looks and does the search and tells you the result
Sure ,  she does the search for you then she looks looks in a few bookstores
ah , 
In the second bookstores online and ,  and she gives you a list ordered ,  from cheaper to more expensive
ah ,  wow
And then she takes out the cheapest one ,  that's very good I
that's good
I've bought a lot of things like that ,  because later of course what it does it redirects you to the web page of wherever ,  for example
If it finds that the cheapest price is in amazon ,  well you click on ,  on the cheapest ones it sends you directly to
ah , 
to the book tab on amazon and well you already bought it through amazon ,  you know
but it's always through the internet I mean is not that you go and then they tell you then you go to
No ,  no ,  is always by Internet ,  I mean is always online sale
mm ,  okay
yes ,  because sure those are used books and I think that it only has books ,  sales of used books through the internet and of course is an online store
It doesn't physically exist ,  sure . 
mm ah ,  okay ,  I've ordered books
So
like that ,  here locally ,  ah ah , 
yes , 
No ,  they sent it to me by mail
yes ,  I saw all the manuals of ,  of
but not for
professionals ,  you know ,  the Psychology ,  psychiatry manuals ,  all technical books you know
yes ,  aha
And these books are really expensive because sure ,  they come out ,  they have a very short run .   And sure ,  to earn money the publisher makes them really expensive ,  like a book can cose you one hundred and fifty dollars
yes ,  true
really easily .   And this is expensive ,  this is rip off ,  it takes the skin off your back paying this money for a book that's about one hundred pages
yes ,  and what did you do with your computer from here ,  you bought it here ,  or you brought it
I bought it here .   I bought it here because this is something I had ,  that I didn't know what to do ,  to buy it in Spain or buy it here
a plan
But I bought it on sale and look ,  if it breaks
hmm
Where I will have to go and fix it here so I bought it here .   Well ,  it's covered by a guarantee
sure , 
Nevertheless ,  if I buy it in Spain and it breaks here ,  well ,  it will be where I go to claim
sure ,  so it's good
we'll see ,  so I bought it here ,  also you know what happened ,  it broke twice .   Like ,  better that I bought it here
aye yes ,  but ,  you already had your guarantee and everything
Sure ,  well ,  it broke twice ,  the first time I had to send ,  ah ,  IMB ,  it's an IMB ,  it's an IBM
hmmm
It's a laptop and it broke twice but I had to send ,  They sent me a box so I could put it in the box
aha
And they returned it to me fixed and the second time ,  the hard disc broke
wow
But I'm talking about a computer that's less than a year old ,  eh
ah ,  no ,  so
Like
they had to send you another one ,  no
No ,  I ,  what they did is they took it to a place and there they changed the hard disc ,  like practically ,  No ,  no the new one sure , 
But since they told me that they'd sold me a lemon
I had to ,  I bought a computer over the phone ,  and it was a bad deal ,  the first time I bought
yes ,  yes ,  Hey ,  I'm sorry
so
that you bought a
by mistake .   No ,  man ,  I saw it when I was watching the Hispanic channel
aha
and there was an offer so that it was in Florida and you call an eight hundred number and I don't know
aha
And I bought like that because it was a good price When it arrived it was a ,  like a clon that they call ,  that ,  that had
ah ,  yes ,  one was yes
it was different brands ,  I mean the keyboard was of one brand ,  the screen was was of another brand ,  the monitor and like that so that was like fi ,  fi ,  fixed
aha
and that lasted me like three months or four
that's bad
and then I called him and I called him ,  and they changed the phone and the company didn't exist any more
I mean that they did ,  rule
it was a tmo And then the second one ,  now I did
sure
I boght for ,  for the brand
sure
That there was eh ,  also for some offers on television but it was that it's a brand and it's a warranty and all , no , 
sure ,  sure ,  sure
Of three years ,  then this one is still running ,  but
It's good ,  the Dell too ,  they're all good ,  Compact ,  Dell
mhm ,  mhm
I bought and IBM for myself because Here at Penn ,  ther was an offer of ,  for Penn students
ah ,  that's good
And I bought And I paid a thousand dollars less ,  than if I had bought it ,  you know
Oh ,  it worked out good for you ,  good
with ,  like that ,  in the market yes ,  it was ,  it was ,  well ,  is a computer yes ,  it cost three thousand dollars
aha
And I only paid two thousand dollars ,  in other words I saved a thousand dollars
ah ,  good
I saved one thousand dollars
but it still got damaged twice ,  in one year
Okay ,  Okay ,  that did come out bad ,  I think that it's come out bad and And ,  ah ,  well ,  now I'll knock on wood ,  but
But don't they send you a new one ,  you can't say that you want a new one
But Well that's what I of course ,  told them ,  but they told me ,  no ,  no because is under warranty and then since the only thing that happens ,  is that the hard disk came loose ,  well we changed the disk
hard and it was fixed ,  you know and well the truth is that ever since they did that ,  it hasn't gotten damaged again
ah ,  well
So ,  yes I mean ,  we'll see ,  let's see ,  I knock on wood already everywhere , 
yes ,  you need it
That it doesn't break again ,  because if it breaks again ,  I already don't know what I'm going to have to do to it ,  I'm going to have to send it to hell
Sure
So
And how have you felt these days ?  are you okay ? 
Fine ,  I'm very good ,  with a lot of work in the laboratory And well ,  without commissions ,  that haven't coming out yet ,  but well

Sure and well ,  and ,  look ,  organic chemistry is something like cooking ,  you know ,  that you put it on to cook and you don't know how it will come out
Like ,  you can have an idea but
yeah ,  chemistry is really complicated to me always ,  since it's not exact
Sure ,  it's not exact
And I didn't know how to make it ,  so ,  so I could understand ,  no ,  and there
Sure ,  no ,  no ,  it's ,  it's complicated ,  you have to ,  you have to go in a little ,  in chemistry's own language ,  you know
aha
Work with it a little bit ,  but it's true ,  it's something a little bit strange ,  and when you start doing experiments ,  you realize that
that everything comes out a little in the end ,  you know
an and after ,  but ,  and after it turns out well and then you say ,  well ,  what did I do ,  no , 
Sure ,  exactly ,  then it turns out well and you apply it a posteriori ,  when it comes out ,  but when it didn't turn out no one knew ,  you know
ah ,  how funny ,  no
yes ,  like that this is ,  it's a little tricky ,  yes ,  it's a little tricky
ah , 
But well ,  here we are ,  here everyone sees ,  and we take the molecule but

No thank God ,  this time ,  there wasn't much .  The last one yes . 
blessed ? 
With Katrina there was a lot of flooding and a lot ,  eh ,  many people had a lot of problems . 
Okay
So and over there I know you don't have hurricanes but
Earth  a few earthquakes .   And now I think that something with Mount St .  Helen's ,  they said that maybe something will happen again .   I don't know what it is
I just saw it on television ,  always something
You really have earthquakes over there ? 
Yes ,  every now and then ,  but they're not that hard . 
Wow
It's been three years since we had one that was a little bit strong . 
Wow .   I didn't know this
But ,  no ,  not all the time .   So ,  And what do you think about telemarketers ? 
Not much .   I don't like them
No ,  no ,  my husband and I bought this button ,  that you ,  when you an  answer ,  you hear that it's them ,  you open the button and until it says tin ,  tin tin
the person who's there ,  after calling ,  doesn't answer this kind of call .   It says it three times . 
Ah
But those with no shame keep calling . 
Wow
I say
No ,  we ,  eh ,  we put ourselves on the do not call list
Aha
and you know ,  when they call ,  which is not much eh ,  normally I always tell them ,  you know ,  not to call again .  That ,  that we are on the list .  But we put our house phone ,  the cellulars ,  everything because they were even calling me on the cellular
Ah ,  listen . 
and for that ,  you know ,  one has to pay so much with the cellular ,  for ,  for a crappy call ,  like I call it
Aha
you know ,  so no
Yes
I never ,  when they call me ,  I don't think that I've ever ,  bought anything or ,  gotten the service that they are offering me . 
No ,  the only ,  the only thing I've gotten is when they call me from the police here from where ,  I live . 
Aha
Then ,  because is something ,  about looking for a kid ,  and finding him ,  and then I do make donations to them . 
yes yes
But no ,  the other day one called me ,  and because they said they wanted me to refinance my house ,  and told me my husband was laughing because ,  I'm here sitting ,  and I say
no ,  I'm the one who rents ,  I don't live here and he laughed Because I didn't want to talk with them . 
Yes
And I say ,  no ,  they don't live here . 
I
They stay
Sometime ,  no when they call ,  you know ,  they start telling me whatever .  I don't want to get rude with them . 
Hm mm
But ,  I usually tell them that I'm not ,  not interested ,  thank you very much . 
Aha
And sometimes they say ,  okay have a nice day ,  but I get really mad when they
you've told them that and they say ,  oh no but let me tell you this ,  you know ,  oh ,  we have a new offer or whatever and then ,  I'm like ,  I'm done ,  goodbye . 
Yes ,  aha ,  exactly
and I hang up . 
Exactly you've already told them that you are not interested and they keep going , 
Yes
And now ,  what they are doing now is that they play a tape and you think you are talking to someone but you are talking to a recording
Yes
I got one today ,  a man was calling about refinancing my house and I'm like no ,  but he doesn't answer back so I hung up ,  you see . 
my husband ,  did you take his name and if they call again ,  we could ,  I mean ,  no ,  I didn't take his name ,  I just hung up . 
Yes
It's too much
And they do that here too ,  you know ,  they say ,  talk to you as if they were
as if it was one of your friends
Aha
You know ,  they say ,  you know ,  hello blah blah blah and I'm ,  you know and a minute later you realize or well ,  at least I do , 
Hm mm
I realize that it's not a call for me but a telemarketer
Yes ,  oh ,  to me ,  I had a ,  I thought that I knew her ,  because she calls me and how hello Tami how are you ,  what have you done . 
And I say ,  and I say ,  who is it ,  and she says ,  no who I am ,  and I say ,  aye look at you .   These shameless people ,  so ,  I thought it was someone I knew . 
Yes
Who I hadn't talked to for a while ,  and I say ,  no no no .   I don't know who it is so I hung up .   But also in my email .   My husband
Yes
laughed because he came ,  and looked at me ,  and says to me ,  how much email do you have here .   I say eighty four .   And I think that out of these eighty four ,  only fifteen are
mine ,  the others are junk . 
Yes
So ,  here I will put my ,  my blocker more ,  higher ,  higher ,  so
Yes
they catch everything ,  so it doesn't come to be ,  because
I have three or four email addresses .   And what I do is when I ,  eh ,  I'm you know ,  for a promotion or whatever , 
I give a specific email . 
Ah ,  yes
And for the personal things ,  the ,  you know ,  my family ,  my friends ,  whatever ,  I give another .   And the one I always give for ,  for promotions and things like that ,  it's the Yahoo one
Aha
but I don't check it every day because you know ,  almost no one sends me anything there .   And the other days it happens like
Yes
I think that it was two or three weeks when I hadn't checked it ,  and when I checked it ,  I had two thousand something emails .   And my husband looked at me and said ,  well you're popular
That's a lot ,  wow . 
Yes
Ah ,  it happened to me once that a company sent me ,  she sent me thirty six thirty six ,  every hour . 
Oh wow
And ,  and my husband ,  that is ,  because is coming out ,  because I mean I was here working in the computer and it would appear in the corner ,  one ,  two ,  three
and I say ,  but it's the same company .  I don't know ,  it seemed that it was ,  something happened to that company ,  that something in their computer was bad . 
wow
So I spent three days with that .  Every once in a while .  And I say ,  oh God .  Until they finally responded to the email I had sent them telling them that
they were sending me too many emails ,  that they were filling up my mail ,  and that was a pain to be deleting all their emails . 
Hm mm
But no man ,  So ,  yes . 
And ,  sometimes ,  when they send me email if it's interesting you know ,  could be .  Like today they sent me something of
it was something about ,  about ,  kids ,  it was something about childs find something like that
Aha
Then ,  I found it interesting ,  and it lets you know if there are any sexual offenders
Aha
in your neighborhood . 
Oh
And ,  then you know ,  that for me ,  to see and ,  I realized that here ,  you know ,  like two or three houses from here ,  there's one . 
look
That lives ,  and I ,  you know ,  I didn't even know ,  so that was probably the only email that they have ,  that they have sent me
Aha
that I have ,  you know ,  let's say responded to that . 
And I ,  I received one before yesterday ,  that surprised me because of that Yes ,  it was from shop dot com
Hm mm
Is a magazine they have out ,  but they sent it because see how they knew my ,  where I lived , 
Hm mm
and they sent me the amber alert
Aha
that a girl had taken had brought the kids from Oregon here to Washington
Wow
I say ,  that ,  that does interest me ,  because if I see ,  if I see it ,  I can say something ,  but they don't send me anything else but that .  I say ,  well okay . 
Yes
So ,  And do you have kids ? 
Yes ,  I have a daughter who's twenty two months old .  And I'm expecting another one in four weeks
Ah ,  look And is good to know about those sex offenders Because here I had one I didn't know I had one in the back part of
of my house .  There's a street ,  and next to the street there's a big park .  Huge .  And at the end of that street a lady was renting the room to a man . 
Sex offender and the and here we are two blocks away from a school
Yes
I say ,  what is that man doing there .  So I would tell my youngest son ,  he's now fifteen ,  I would tell him ,  don't go to that park ,  don't even
ask me that you were going to the park ,  or go to a friend's house ,  but you have to tell  me .  Because that which is ,  level two . 
I say no ,  no ,  no ,  no .  But they didn't tell anyone ,  i noticed because they also sent me something over the e mail
Yeah ,  that ,  that's what surprised me ,  that ,  i put the address and we live in a community that has ,  lets say about two hundred houses
Right
and i live in the eighty eight ,  sorry ,  eighty six
Right
but the number ,  since the houses are positioned ,  well ,  it was number one hundred and nineteen ,  and one hundred and twenty two
Right
And that's turning on the curve ,  from here
Oh
Three or four houses ,  you know
Uh huh
From here ,  but my little girl hasn't ,  you know ,  she doesn't ,  she doesn't go out alone ,  because she's very little . 
Yes
But ,  if we stay here ,  well ,  you know ,  we have to keep something ,  you know , 
Right ,  it's good to know ,  because in case you bring your family home
Yeah
that they have kids a little bit older ,  well ,  who knows
Yeah
You have to keep your eyes on them when they're your kids ,  nephews and everything ,  because ,  uh ,  they're fast .  That people is fast . 
Yes ,  and ,  and ,  i don't know ,  i ,  you know ,  that ,  that always ,  it annoys me a lot ,  well ,  ¿who doesn't ? 
Hm mm
I mean ,  I ,  I used to be a teacher and I used to ,  I used to have a student that had had a similar problem ,  you know ,  he was abused or whatever . 
Aha ,  yes
And it was quite hard ,  you know ,  for me ,  for me ,  and for him too .  Of course ,  it was harder for him but
Aha
you know ,  as his teacher ,  you never know how
how to ,  if you should touch him or talk to him because
yes ,  or like ,  how to treat him ,  if the problem he has is because he can't understand what's going on or because ,  you know ,  for what has happened to him
hm mm
so ,  it's a bit difficult . 
Yes
But ,  you know ,  thank God ,  you know ,  no ,  no ,  it didn't happen a lot ,  but when it did ,  it was hard .  But ,  did you say that you have a fifteen year old son ? 
Yes ,  one is fifteen and the other one is nineteen years old . 
Wow
But he has moved out now . 
Aha
He didn't want to remain in school . 
Oh
So ,  I told him ,  if you don't want to stay in school ,  you should look for a job and so ,  he moved out .  If he wanted to stay in my house he had to go to school . 
So ,  he did .  He's there ,  living with his girlfriend .  I always tell him not to have a child yet ,  I'm too young to be a grandma . 
well
and he's like no mom ,  I'll do it when I'm thirty years old and I'm like ,  okay ,  no problem then . 
When he's thirty . 
So ,  the little one might make me a grandmother before .  He might become a dad ,  whoever is hotter
Well
Oh no ,  but sometimes I ,  sometimes there are some good things with telemarketing ,  they give you information but not all the time .  Most of the time ,  I believe that
in my opinion ,  around ninety percent are trash .

No ,  I live alone ,  I left my family in Mexico four years ago ,  to study preparatory ,  too .

good grief ,  And they haven't gotten those hurricane winds ? 
No they haven't gotten them ,  luckily they are very far form the coast .

So they didn't get any of that . 
Thank God because it has been tremendous ,  right . 
yes yes is very bad ,  who knows what has happened all of a sudden there's been a lot of hurricanes . 
yes the news are so horrible that it puts you , 
mm ,  yes
to think so many things ,  and then here they ran out of gas . 
Besides it would be too much ,  it ran out . 
Yesterday ,  No yesterday it ran out in front of my house there's a station , 
Really . 
And then I said ,  ah ,  I thought it was running out in the whole city ,  but then ,  this morning there was . 
okay
So then I put , 
How much is the gallon already . 
no ,  is not so much because it said two ninety eight ,  no . 
ah okay
regular ,  but I put it . 
okay
I thought that I was going to fill it with twenty dollars but no . 
No
It came to a half tank ,  no more .   So you worry ,  you say how everything changes ,  right ,  yes . 
yes ,  how it changes , 
One thing with the other . 
This also seemed to me pretty wow ,  I say ,  it was a tragedy there but I didn't think that it would affect the outside country so much . 
Yeah and they say that the gas , 
hmm
How you pay gas here in the , 
yes
for the heating and everything ,  now I don't know if this will get really expensive . 
Besides right ,  because yeah ,  besides winter is coming ,  this is true .   I didn't think about this ,  it will be really expensive . 
And it will be seventy percent more ,  I don't know how we will do it because it was already expensive before . 
Seriously ,  about how much do you spend on heating a month ? 
ah ,  I don't know if you have to pay for a whole apartment ,  or what . 
yes ,  well ,  what happens is that ,  it's not so much because I only pay a fixed rent . 
ah ,  perfect ,  this is the best .   aha
here at the university ,  so ,  yes ,  right now ,  I've always complained ,  but now really , 
Ah no ,  it's the best . 
it's the best ,  it was good for me ,  yes . 
No I have ,  since I live with my dad and all then , 
mm
we have an apartment but is very expensive like two hundred per month is that I'm spending . 
wow
on gas only ,  and eh ,  I was thinking that there are apartments that they rent them including gas and I say ,  like I'm going to have to get one of those because , 
Well maybe ,  maybe they'll stop doing that ,  because is not going to be good for the , 
that's what I say ,  that now everything is going to increase because , 
they rent like that ,  yes
Yes one thing increases ,  everything increases and like that I don't know .  I don't know ,  we are a bit disoriented because these things had never happened to us ,  no . 
mm
Yes that the things increased the prices Normal ,  well some cents ,  but
Calm to get used to it ,  didn't give
aha
give time to work ,  or for the salaries to increase or something . 
For one to establish ,  make a budget know what you were going to do ,  but
mm
this time it was a ,  like they say all at once . 
yes
gosh ,  but ,  ah
And where does all your family live ,  where does your son live for example ? 
here in the north east
With the grandchildren ,  Too . 
North east in Philadelphia with his wife ,  yes . 
Okay okay
We are like fifteen minutes in ,  I don't know if you know Rising Sun ,  a big avenue . 
No ,  the truth is that more or less ,  since I don't have a car here . 
aha
when ,  this is what I've seen ,  when you drive a car . 
yeah
You can get to know the city really well .   But right now ,  I can't well ,  I only go in metro or in some trucks and yeah it isn't
ah the metro ,  yes ,  and go and come home to study
yes besides maybe it will give me time ,  I'm staying now this summer ,  I've spent two summers here . 
aye God .   Hmm
And that's when I go out a lot ,  and I love Philadelphia like this when I can go out . 
Oh
But now that the year is starting and everything's stressful and then it will start to get cold ,  so it's not the same . 
Oh yes ,  And do you have many friendships ? 
More or less .   I've already spent two years here so at the beginning I didn't go out much , 
hmm
but right now I have some more people I've met more people .   Sorry ? 
And have you met people through this program ?  You haven't met people from Philadelphia through this program . 
No ,  I had never been in Philadelphia . 
More people well ,  besides me
Can you hold on a moment ,  what happened who ah ,  Okay sorry . 
They are not calling
Yes no is a friend that lived with us and she left already . 
aha
Then she's just saying hi ,  only . 
ah wow how nice . 
yes is that here ,  well is like we share rooms , 
aha
and each year they practically change the person with whom you live . 
yes and you go a lot , 
Which is well ,  is hard getting used to is but it's interesting . 
if you go to Penns Landing there
Also ,  But just when there are events ,  yes I like to go ,  I've gone a couple of times with the whole Latin community
aha Yeah ,  a lot of people go ,  and they do Polish and Greek and all the festivals . 
Of those no ,  I hardly find out ,  I find out about all the Latin things that there are . 
ah well
Because well here we are all the Mexicans and the Latins well we are very united .  That's something I like which is making my life easier also . 
You have many Hispanic friendships , 
yes ,  this yes . 
aye ,  how nice . 
So yes ,  this is good because when it grabs me ,  when I miss home a lot ,  or something ,  well I go with them ,  I can go and dance with them and yeah . 
hmm there where they dance ,  Are there many places to dance ? 
It helps be a little .   There aren't many ,  I only like one ,  I like two .   That's pure ,  pure salsa and pure cumbia . 
ah yes
so ,  but convincing people to go is really complicated ,  since no one dances this here .   Well all my friends from here it's like ,  hmmm
They go once a year . 
There's one that's called Brazil ,  no . 
But not more ,  yes ,  to Brazil ,  I go there ,  it's one and there's another really good one that's Havana Cafe .   That's more like a club . 
aha
but they play everything ,  really good music . 
Aha ,  this is close to the the twenty two over there . 
yes ,  and Chestnut ,  between Chestnut and Samsom
yes
And we love it ,  this is really good . 
Ah ,  a lot of people from Venezuela house go there . 
Sorry . 
Many of the Hispanics from Venezuela house go there ,  it's a Hispanic organization . 
hmm
And they always invite for breakfast there ,  or to a party or something ,  now they're going to have a party one of these days
yes ,  yes ,  there's a lot of parties ,  we're also going rent .   The Mexicans ,  to have a party ,  half backwards ,  but for independence there . 
Ah yes . 
And it's good ,  it makes for a good ambiance . 
Ah how nice . 
I say it's better than the normal Hip Hop parties that really I can't stand ,  so this is nothing more ,  it's not my style . 
Americans nothing more . 
yes ,  and what's more with warm beer and bad music and ,  no . 
ah
yes ,  no . 
You drink Corona . 
No
Well ,  here they drink a lot of Corona . 
Here too ,  but not in the parties here ,  here they buy they cheapest and with this yeah , 
hmm

What I miss are the little coffee ,  the coffee
Yes ,  I've been looking for it everywhere . 
Hmm when there's ah ,  when I'm there at the cafe with this Hispanic espresso ,  or mixed or whatever there is . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes

okay
But not if they go the same days or how the thing is . 
mm
And they always let us know ,  well .  That if they are going to put you know ,  an offering that if a mass ,  or things like that .  At least the cultures are similar ,  right ,  Catholic . 
yes that's true .  mm
I'm close now to the virgin of Guadalupe . 
yes
I like to pray to her a lot and I think she's very miraculous .  You are also Catholic . 
yes and always the virgin of Guadalupe is the one we follow the most . 
mm yes
I think that ,  I mean we have the town and which is all for the virgin in Mexico . 
Sure
So then I've seen more or less that they even pray more to her than to Jesus or any other saint . 
ah yes
Is very important . 
And is very beautiful ,  I have to take a little statue to a lady that asked me for it ,  I don't know here where you can find it ,  but I'm going to try to find it . 
mhm Ah ,  there must be ,  I'm sure that there must be in the South or something like that there are many things
Where there are sales of ,  of religious articules . 
mhm or wherever it is in any place more or less ,  Mexican ,  well Mexican I know .  I'm sure they have something of the Virgin . 
yes or yes no house of religion
But yes
And there they sell some burritos that are very good ,  in the center ,  at eleven

okay
aha ,  and now well . 
And you don't go much to the city then ,  like to Center
I
Hello ,  eh ,  With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking ? 
ah ,  with Joe .   And what's your name ? 
ah ,  my name's Silvia ,  nice to meet you . 
yes nice to meet you
And where ,  where are you ? 
Philadelphia and you ? 
ah ,  I'm also in Philadelphia ,  what a coincidence . 
ah yes ,  yes I live at Pennsylvania University .   And where do you live ? 
ah ,  just ,  just outside ,  outside of the city ,  yes
ah ,  what a coincidence . 
yes .   And how ,  tell me again what's your name ? 
Joe
Joe ,  ah ,  very good ,  very good
yes ,  And what do you think of telemarketing ? 
Look ,  eh ,  these telemarketers I ,  threw them all out of the country . 
ah yes ,  Why ? 
eh ,  they're robbers and only ,  give private business a bad name .   Eh ,  Believe me that I remember that when they were before congress the law
that was going to restrict them a lot and would take away a lot of business .   They were saying that ,  that they fulfilled an eh ,  eh ,  an important job . 
because ,  yes ,  people ,  the lobbyists of the telemarketers said that the telemarketers fulfilled an important job ,  to help the economy to stay strong
because ,  they gave jobs to a great many Americans . 
mhm
so ,  if they took them away ,  they would hurt the national economy . 
No ,  well I think that's right because
Well but we should then say ,  they shouldn't go after anyone ,  the prostitutes or the drug dealers . 
no ,  no ,  well ,  my aunt ,  she works in telemarketing and she doesn't have a huge business as she used to have ,  it has decreased ,  she lives in Puerto Rico . 
Who ? 
My aunt . 
Oh ,  yes
yes
ah
yes ,  my aunt lives in Puerto Rico and she's had lots of problems since they approved that law . 
oh ,  you see ,  you see ,  oh well but in Puerto Rico ,  everybody is on welfare so ,  it doesn't matter ,  she's on welfare too . 
yes ,  no ,  no ,  it's been so hard for her ,  so ,  well ,  sure ,  she has a legal job ,  it's not like she's a prostitute or a drug dealer , 
yes
she has a good and honorable job ,  it's a shame ,  really
oh
that they've eliminated it because she's  now collecting unemployment benefits and all that
unemployed
yes ,  unemployed ,  yes
Getting unemployment benefits . 
because during time it has been very difficult ,  but then if you think that  might be spam ? 
Unfortunately spam is another ,  so many businesses and some are good some are bad
telemarketers are those that generate more spam you try to defend but they send a lot of spam
mhm okay
most of them are private companies
mhm ,  mhm ,  um ,  right ? 
and
I think Microsoft wants to do something about all spam
and mhm
most of them send Emails
mhm
the computer has to do the job of separating spam
okay
so most of the time you have to process the information and it takes a little time
oh ,  okay mm
so then
the problem is that they send it thousands of people
yes exactly ,  because if you only send it to one person it does not matter
yes
yes we send thousands ,  or perhaps millions of emails . 
eh ,  yes ,  yes ,  aha
then it is troublesome already ,  but I don't know what has happened with that
now ,  but ,  but nowadays the perception I have is that spamming comes more from the outside ,  because here it is already a little more difficult
eh
that is the perception I have
yes ,  no ,  I don't think the filtering shall work with the spam because eh ,  eh ,  I think it is too complicated ,  I think it is easier ,  if you do something like this then you can
you can decide to get only some of the emails ,  receiving only some emails that have a certain certification ,  given by ,  for instance if you have windows
you have to receive a code ,  but that code ,  let's say ,  can only be achieved if they do ,  if they process the information that needs to be processed
mhm
it is like a key ,  right ?  ,  that the computer needs
mm
to find ,  then ,  if it finds the key ,  you get the email ,  otherwise you know automatically that it is spam
mhm mhm mm
I think so ,  but obviously it won't bw that esay if it hasn't been done yet
mhm ,  mhm
but
yes ,  yes
yes because the filtering doesn't ,  doesn't work ,  it is too complicated because
yes
because ,  because there are so many ,  probably that is the problem too ,  if there is a company who  sends advertising because I for instance get them
of a company ,  here in the States ,  travel which is a travel agency
mm
and ,  and they send emails every two weeks of ,  of all the rebates they have
aha
and eh ,  I'm interested in receiving them because that's something that really interests me because that eh out of curiosity ,  what they have right
aha
but eh ,  but for that company it would make it very hard if one gets a system like that ,  it would be very problematic for them ,  right
yes that is true ,  mm ,  mm
yes then just all how they say mass mail would be hard for them ,  but that's the least I say ,  I think that's the least . 
mm ,  now but I was talking the other day
because spam they say that
with a lady in Chicago that she was very proudly telling me ,  because when the telemarketers call here I tell them so and so is not here ,  or call her back at such time . 
and ,  and is a time that I'm not going to be here . 
aha
and one says ,  but because she ,  she is really proud ,  of how she cons them ,  but eh ,  I say ,  but how is it that this lady hasn't realized
that ,  that with these people that call on the phone ,  what you have to do is ,  just ,  not answer ,  hang up the phone without talking to them ,  or not answer , 
and ,  and it was a shame because the call got disconnected and I was going to tell her about the service system from the company that I have , 
mm
where eh if a per  when they call eh ,  it doesn't let calls go through that don't identify the company . 
yes
That telemarketers are usually like ,  and then when this happens ,  a recording comes up where the person is trying to tell you ,  uh ,  identify it's name ,  so the one who gets the call can choose if he takes it or not
Uh huh
that's not the problem ,  since they're machines ,  when they get to that ,  they still need the human element to tell where they're calling from
So that's when it ,  the call breaks up because there's no human element
Uh huh
and ,  because of that ,  almost no one calls ,  only one call gets through every six months ,  and there was a time when i had it off
For reasons that aren't important ,  i had it off for two weeks ,  three weeks ,  and more or less all day every two days or so
uh ,  i received one of those calls even with that new law ,  the ,  the do not call list where everybody has already signed up
Uh huh
but ,  and when i put that function up again ,  the calls disappeared again ,  so in the end ,  what everyone should do and
is call their phone company and find out if they have that option
yeah ,  no ,  it's true ,  yeah ,  maybe ,  well i have a cellphone and i have never .  .  .  I'm studying at college ,  so i don't have a phone
Oh ,  yes
the ,  a land line ,  it's just a cellphone and ,  uh ,  well the telemarketers have never called me
i don't know ,  maybe there's no law for that
i don't know
there must not be a law ,  because i remember that with the fax ,  they passed a law that they couldn't send unsolicited material ,  uh ,  over the fax
Uh
And it was because people used your paper
uh
I imagine this happens in an era where the faxes still had thermal paper . 
is
eh ,  it was more expensive and more problematic
hmm
eh ,  and ,  and because of that is that the ,  the companies receive very few commercial faxes and ,  and it is against the law that eh ,  you can take them to court and sue them because of that I read about that once
hmm yes well with my cell phone I think it is because I have never ,  I never give my cell number yes eh ,  for
well but you never give your number and the telemarketers find it
no ,  no ,  no ,  well that is surely because if you have a ,  a credit card you give your telephone number , 
the credit card has it then the ,  maybe the credit card company belongs to a company that has a bank ,  then the bank has the name then the bank call or maybe
yes
somehow they get the number , get the number but
I remember the credit cards I gave them a wrong number on purpose . 
hmm
and one time ,  they told me I told them i gave them a wrong number on purpose because you instead of use it properly ,  only use it
hmm
to call you if there is a problem with my credit card you use it for a lot of commercial things and even you sell it to whoever wants to buy it . 
yes and I imagine too that they take a lot of numbers from the telephone directory ,  many telephone numbers
yes ,  yes ,  yes
and I think from the telephone directory and go to the people ,  then .  but mine is not on the directory .

Hola ,  Good evening
Good evening .  How are you ?  What's your name ? 
Fine ,  Manuel
Manuel
yes
How are you Manuel ? 
eh ,  good
Where do you call from ? 
From Chicago ,  Illinois . 
Chicago ,  I live here in Colorado ,  Denver ,  Colorado . 
okay
Hm ,  how he explains the topis ,  sometimes confusing what he tries to say ,  but I think he is talking ,  about marketing topic .  And as they do in several ways on the phone . 
Electronic ,  I don't know how much ,  they bother you with calls or emails about that
oh yes
yes ,  please ,  talk
Oh ,  yes by by phone ,  not much but I do receive by mail ,  several times I'm receiving only offers ,  and a lot of things ,  a lot of things I do see ,  a lot of things I'm just only
well I ignore them ,  they are thing I'm not interested in
The same happens to me ,  they used to call my phone before a lot ,  but with my private phone ,  but because a new law started here in Colorado ,  almost don't
the telemarketers don't bother on the phone ,  but they do on internet ,  I receive a lot of emails requesting for business ,  and things like that .  And sometimes when I answer one of those emails I receive like ten more like that . 
yeah
yes I try to avoid them as much as I can ,  some things do interest me but ,  I'm very careful ,  about what email I open nowadays .  And ,  and do you go on the Internet a lot ? 
ah ,  not too much ,  I don't have much time sometimes because of work .  Or for being home with the family . 
yes ,  you have a family ,  how nice . 
yes
And how are things there in Chicago ? 
eh ,  they're fine . 
The other day I spoke to a person from Chicago also and was telling me
yes
how things are over there and that .  It's not so ,  is not so cold today right . 
No it's cool ,  is like ,  I don't know like fifty five .  It was raining everywhere ,  the majority of the day ,  in the morning was fine . 
oh really
It was raining in parts ,  it would come and leave ,  would come again ,  a little bit of wind . 
Here today was really nice ,  a bit sunny and pleasant .  But already ,  you can already tell that here the weather is going to start changing ,  well here in the mountains it snows . 
But the city is something else .  The city is like seventy
eighty degrees ,  the mountains can be lower than that . 
yes ,  I was I lived ,  I was not living ,  working there in Nebraska two years ago ,  well it's close to there
yes ,  yes
And the cold is very different ,  there is a lot . 
yes ,  is .  .  is different ,  the cold here is dry ,  there in Chicago ,  is humid . 
um uh
And yes I don't know if I worked outside ,  but I imagine that it will harm him when he's in that bad cold of January .  that if ,  how long have you been there in Chicago ? 
I have ,  coming to five years . 
Five years . 
And yes ,  I do work outside ,  seasonal work in construction . 
yes
And sometimes we have to be outside ,  for one reason or another we go out and ,  sometimes we have to spend up to two three hours outside ant it's very cold . 
woo ,  And have you gotten used to it ? 
yes yes ,  you get used to it like with everything .  But yes ,  it's different to the ,  the weather that com  ,  the com  ,  it feels here ,  like what you feel there ,  I tell you that I was in Nebraska . 
aha
yes it's very different to
yes very .  Do you come from Mexico ? 
yeah yes
And which part of Mexico ? 
From Durango
Durango ,  yes ,  I've been there ,  I have friends here from Durango ,  I'm from Puerto Rico . 
oh
I've been living here in Colorado for seventeen years
oh ,  what
I've been here a long time and well here she grew ,  was born and has grown my daughter too .  Do you have a large family ? 
yeah I have a girl and another one that will be born one of these days . 
How nice ,  what a blessing ,  congratulations .  Yes I have a five year old daughter ,  I had her when I was already older And listen ,  then as far as the internet ,  trying to get back to the topic . 
yes
And you have I mean have you ,  ever gone into those chat rooms or something like that . 
eh ,  no ,  I went some time back ,  but only out of curiosity ,  not ,  not ,  to be on that no ,  it doesn't call my attention ,  it doesn't interest me to meet people like that with that ,  they are things that no . 
Me neither ,  I used to think before that it was a good idea but you find very strange people there that say one thing and turn out to be a different way and . 
yes
that scared me a lot as to keep going to the chat rooms .  But yes ,  I get a lot of mail ,  every time I open my
yes
mail ,  since I have like two or three email addresses
yes
So they often flood me with something and I have ,  and I spend a good while deleting the emails
yes
Is that they put one's address ,  they sell it to other people so then one starts to receive all sorts of things . 
yes
they even send you viagra things
yes once they were sending me sometimes ,  during the course of three to four days
yes
that I didn't check it ,  I would get even seventy ,  eighty emails of different things ,  like all those of the playboy movies all that of
yes
I don't know how they started to get my email and started to send me and send me . 
no ,  you have what you have ,  the problem is that if you open one mail of something ,  then they know it is an active address and they start selling it to everybody
exactly
In my job also ,  because I use Internet a lot in my job ,  it is a part of my job .  Just for answering a couple of mails like these ,  I went one week on vacations
no ,  two weeks ,  and when I came back I had more than five thousand emails ,  can you imagine ?  ,  mixed with my regular correspondence ,  because otherwise i would have just clicked 'delete'
wow
to it altogether ,  but I had to be careful not to delete the job mails
I know ,  when that happened to me I had to check everything because I also had my communications with my family in Mexico
Oh ,  yes ,  how good
and I did it through Internet ,  and when I wanted to see if I had a message from them ,  well ,  there was one from them and about forty or fifty from others that
wow
and I had to
and do you have a good communication with them ,  this way via Internet ? 
oh ,  yes
How good ,  how good
Yes ,  I have family in Monterrey ,  not so much in Durango ,  most of them left already
Do you have many brothers and sisters ? 
yes ,  I have five
wow ,  I had four brothers ,  I lost one here in Colorado three years ago .  But I keep in touch with my other brothers ,  they live in different places
eh ,  I keep in touch through Internet ,  rather than telephone
oh
Sometimes I get to work and find correspondence from them ,  saying hello and things like this
I see
That's good
It is ,  more entretaining ,  isn't it
yes ,  entertaining and fun  ,  it's good to get mail from your friends all over
aha
And I have made a lot of friends year after year ,  because I have been using Internet since the early nineties ,  since about ninety three ,  so
OK
I am on AOL that is one of the first ones ,  I remember it was awfully slow in the beginning ,  yes I remember when I started using Internet it was really slow
aha
and now with cable and internet ,  it is much faster
I see
in fact ,  I am studying on line ,  and that has helped me a lot ,  because I work full time and I have my daughter ,  so ,  I use the night hours ,  early in the morning ,  and I study
Is it easy to study on line ? 
Well it is in the sense of time flexibility ,  yes it is .  About the subjects of the classes ,  that depends on the university ,  because
if it is hard ,  you have to learn a lot in little time ,  but I find that great ,  I love it
I see
and you learn as much as if you were in a classroom .  Because there are classes where you enter and find the teacher and other students
or the class is recorded and you can see what they talked about
OK
So there are also group projects .  So there are classes ,  and there is like what they call in English discussion boards wehre one discusses about a topic ,  about topic . 
So you give your comments ,  so everyone comments on the comments of your classmates . 
yeah
and like that ,  well they also give grades ,  I think it's good ,  I like it a lot .  I have taken good advantage of it and thanks to that I can
I can finish my major because in another way it would be too difficult for me .  Nowadays with the economy on has to work another
aha
like a part time which is what I do
yes
That the economy is squashing us little by little . 
aha
It's ,  it's hard ,  I don't know how is gas over there ,  but gas is very expensive here . 
Here ,  it was ,  when the first hurricane came eh from , 
Katrina
Katrina The first one here there were places where it climbed up to four dollars . 
there is ,  there is
there were well ,  protests but even so nothing was fixed .  So it was like for what it is the city of Chicago ,  from the center towards the North
ah ,  to the South it was like eh ,  were there wasn't much difference ,  three fifty ,  three fifty five . 
That's outrageous . 
After that ,  it's been about a week since it came down .  It came down to ,  not it's at about two ninety ,  two eighty nine .  But with this other hurricane that just arrived yesterday . 
Now on the weekend . 
yes
And ,  it hasn't gone up ,  but it will go up again . 
Well it affects ,  it didn't seriously affect the refinery ,  but there in Texas there are many refineries and the did a little big of damage and this always affects
it ,  for now ,  we have the average is around two eighty seven ,  two ninety here .   But it can go up ,  like you said ,  it can go up suddenly . 
In fact here they said because ,  a part of here in Illinois is supplying gas here from those refineries in Texas
yes
And since they won't work ,  I don't know ,  they said for two weeks ,  something like this ,  it will normalize everything .   In this time gas will go up here . 
Aye ,  and do you have to drive a lot in the city ? 
Hmm ,  I drive about seventy miles to work . 
Every day ? 
yeah ,  going and seventy
I was going to say that I do seventy ,  but you beat me . 
Hello ? 
Hello .   Yes ? 
With whom am I speaking ? 
Sammy . 
Oh ,  Sabby ,  it's Alex ,  again ,  here ,  from Los Angeles . 
Oh .   Hello Alex ,  how are you ? 
Fine .   And you ? 
Fine here . 
This time I didn't hear very well . 
I think that the were talking about when you go out ,  when they call you at home saying if you want to buy magazines of things like that or you
O 
or in your email when they send you un  unwanted things that they want to sell you ,  things that you didn't ask for . 
Telemarketing
Aha . 
Well ,  ah ,  sometimes there are good deals ,  but other times it's annoying
yes .   It's pre  sometimes what comes here ,  in ,  in my email comes pretty close to my house and other things that
that they shouldn't send me in the email ,  ah ,  looking ,  I say no ,  but they pretend that I don't know ,  and I put them in the delete
For me ,  it's everything ,  more than anything credit cards ,  but many times it's like a scam because they want to charge you money
Hmm . 
that you don't owe
They charge you for the application ,  they charge you for the manual and a bunch of things
No and also they charge you expensive . 
yes . 
Then what I do more than anything ,  I have ah ah ,  like a voice mail Right ,  like a ,  a device that shows the phone
Aha . 
and I don't answer . 
Oh ,  so ,  what I have here is that when a call comes out that I know is one of those telemarketing ones or if I hear it
I have a ,  a thing here connected with the phone that I press and once it comes out it starts to do tin ,  tin ,  tin
three times and says the person you call that you called doesn't answer this types of calls it says it three times well yes is like that ,  annoying if you hear it like that
yes . 
but I say ,  they are calling me when I didn't ask to be called ,  because sometimes they call for stupid things and things like that . 
yes ,  and ,  and I ,  I also ,  I was on ,  on the other side ,  I've done telemarketing and ten or fifteen years ago it was more
easy because the people were not so well prepared
Mm
but nowadays is very hard
yes ,  also
Ah . 
sometimes people call you for things that they call me so that my son who's ,  has barely started high school ,  they want that
that I save money for his college I say ,  I'm doing that ,  I don't need any help from another person who I don't even know who it is
or ,  like that they call me for other things ,  I say ,  man ,  even the navy recruiter is calling my son
Wow . 
I had a recruiter here at my door that surprised me .   They knocked at my door . 
And and was he telemarketing ? 
Eh ,  tellling me and well call me to ,  so that I could put my son in teh mary and I said ,  but listen I'm telling you ,  ay but no
But there are a lot of people that are somewhat rude also .   The telemarketers that you say no to keep on and keep on and keep on there on the phone . 
Until you have to hang up on them . 
Yes ,  many times it's ,  it's like a trick because they want something from you ,  they want to steal something from you like I don't know ,  your identification or something and its not legitimate . 
Yes to the
Because when I was doing telemarketing ,  the main problem problem for the person doing the marketing was the distrust of the people . 
Aha . 
and it was ,  it was very difficult to sell when there is not trust . 
Hhm . 
And then its for for that I believe that ah eh I don't know these days they are utilizing other additional systems for marketing . 
Ah ,  telemarketing eh is dying .   Your opinion . 
Yes here ,  the only one I have used ,  that I have taken is when they call me and its the police or the firefighters . 
From the same neighborhood where I am . 
But eh
e
That's where the trick lies ,  a lot of times ,  there are companies that are not legitimate that say they are collecting money for the police ,  the firefighters . 
Oh no ,  but when I
and ,  and this is really making money for them . 
when I ,  when I do this ,  I
They're lying to you . 
I ask ,  I ask ,  what's it called ?   the number of the ,  what's it called ?   Because when they get ,  when they ,  when you give them a donation
they give you the telephone number ,  the telephone number of ,  I don't remember what it's called and you can find out if
they're legal or not
Ah . 
when they're nonprofit ,  nonprofit organizations they can give you the number that they have because I do this with the
yes . 
with the library ,  they have this ,  so I help with this ,  so I can know which are ,  which aren't ,  before sending my
twenty dollars ,  or whatever I send them . 
And there are also groups ,  especially when there are hurricanes . 
Ah ,  yes . 
I heard this ,  there are cheating groups who ,  they call you to ,  to send them money
yes . 
and ,  and its for their pockets . 
This is what I heard ,  I heard that they had caught three people over there in California doing this . 
yes ,  there were some ,  ah ,  some Hispanics who were doing this . 
yes ,  I know . 
yes .   And this was for the press and they caught them . 
But name
They were putting everything in the pocket . 
how bad ,  ah taking advantage of other people is the worst the people ,  for them to get money . 
And more than anything ,  they would call the elderly
Mm . 
and ,  ah and ah ,  the elderly ,  of course they gave money because they didn't know . 
yes ,  yes .  the majority of the old people yes ,  they like to give a lot of money for things like that .  So people take advantage . 
yes .  No ,  and even legitimate companies and for example I had to pay a telephone bill this week
Aha . 
and ,  is uh I only had to pay the minimum and the person that was doing the telemarketing for the telephone company
was threatening saying that this was going to happen that why didn't I pay more and then I told her ,  you know what lady ?  I only called to pay the
minimum ,  here it says in the letter and with that the phone is not cut off , 
That is
please don't threaten me ,  just accept the payment and that's it . 
Ah God . 
I spoke like that directly to her . 
And I say well . 
So then there are even legitimate companies that try to make threats with the telemarketing
Ah ,  yes ,  yes that also happened to me with the ,  the auto company .  And I pay the account ,  the lady told me she was going to send some one
to go get your car and like you ,  like you were telling me I was paying it on the phone
Mhm
and he said ,  eh ,  I need you to pay more ,  and I said ,  no ,  I will only pay this ,  and I have fifteen days
for the other ,  and I will pay the other in fifteen days .  No ,  then we will send someone to get your car
to tow it away ,  and I said ,  well ,  go get it .  Come and get it
yes ,  that ,  that is called in English 'high pressure tactics'
Aha
Tactics to pressure people to ,  to try to get more money
Mhm
and it is very used in telemarketing ,  that's why it has such a bad reputation
yes ,  because people use it
and ,  and it is often used by legitimate companies who use it with their own costumers
Oh ,  incredible
It is incredible ,  yes ,  that's why the consumer
Mm
has to be very careful with the ,  eh ,  with the telephone calls and you have to know your rights as a consumer
That's true ,  because there are people who
Never ,  eh ,  the rule says you must never give your credit card ,  your credit card number or you checkbook number to anybody who calls
Or your social insurance number ,  some people do that
yes ,  because they ,  they will take your money from the bank
yes ,  and I got one here ,  one email that was supposed to be an email from my bank ,  say  saying that I needed to
that needed some information ,  that for me to give him ah ,  to assure him that this was my bank information . 
They are sneaky . 
And I say ,  yes ,  like I'm going to believe that ,  that my bank will send me that and my husband ,  he ,  he ,  is ah ,  a computer programmer
that he got here in my computer and realized that it was going ,  that it wasn't going directly to the bank ,  it was going by a different place ,  so he sent it to
I think to the  M S N and told them that this person was sending things like this . 
Mm .  Nowadays they are doing more telemarketing through the computer than by phone because
Mm . 
ah ,  there are new laws
yes . 
fighting the telemarketing by phone but it doesn't necessarily apply to the computer . 
yes ,  yes already ,  sometimes ,  lately I heard a person they are going to take to court ,  I think that ,  I think that it was Microsoft or something like that for
having sent like four hundred emails to a person in a week
yes . 
of telemarketing for ,  for the person to buy things ,  I say well ,  well is too much too much .  They get bothered anyways is like ,  no ,  like
they already know that if they can't get you through the phone they get you through the computer . 
Exactly . 
Then in the computer you can't say no because perhaps you go and click and open the letter that they sent you and
end up seeing it and perhaps you read and believe ,  ah yes ,  that is good ,  and you go and get into that .  Without meaning to do it ,  as they say . 
Ah ,  I think they made some new laws that ,  that you can't ah ,  you can't call people that don't want to be bothered
yes ,  I think that you get ,  you have to get on a list
and yes .   and eh ,  and it also applies to the computer and also to the telephone .   For both . 
This is good . 
But every now and then there are good deals with telemarketing
yes ,  sometimes ,  every now and then but not much
For example ,  for the ,  for the cable TV ,  there are sometimes good offers
yes .   The satellite ,  ah yes because I fix myself around the satellite . 
or the satellite too
Aha .   In the directory
parabolic
This was ,  so I decided to call and get my satellite . 
but the one about credit cards and ,  or the financing is usually a scam
Hmm . 
to wring money out of you . 
yes .   And to get you into more problems . 
Hmmm . 
So
And many of these telemarketing sites also have bad working conditions ,  they're horrible places to work and are ,  and they work like the ,  with
under high pressure . 
I imagine . 
So if they pressure their employees ,  they will also pressure the consumers . 
yes .  To find more people to
yes ,  because the bosses in those companies are people who only want to earn money ,  but in an illegitimately  way ,  not in way that is
legitimate then everything is based on ,  taking your money the way they can
Hello ? 
Hello . 
Hello .   With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking ? 
Well ,  I'm Hilaya ,  from Philadelphia . 
Ah ,  my name's Silvia ,  I'm also in Philadelphia . 
Um ,  great ,  great .   Well ,  so ,  the topic was ,  well ,  telemarketing ,  and spam .   No ?   From what I understood . 
yes ,  yes .   What do you think of all this ? 
Well ,  it ,  it bothers me ,  above all ,  the spam in the e mail .   No ?   In the ,  in the e mail .   Because ,  well ,  I work on the computer a lot ,  and , 
I receive a lot of information via email ,  and every day I get a lot of unsolicited mail No ?   Ads ,  from ,  I don't know ,  who want to sell you clocks ,  or want to cheat you directly ,  and this bothers me a lot . 
yes ,  yes ,  it's really annoying ,  yes . 
yes .   From ,  from ,  hmm ,  since I ,  I've only lived here in the United States for a short time .   So ,  mail and telephone calls ,  I don't receive too many . 
Aha ,  hmm . 
Like ,  in this sense ,  I'm calmer . 
Aha .   And where do you come from ? 
I'm from Spain ,  from Barcelona . 
Ah ,  how interesting . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes .  And you ? 
Hmm ,  I'm Cuban . 
Ah . 
yes ,  but ,  but I spent several years in Spain ,  a while ago . 
oh ,  yes ? 
yes yes I really like Spain . 
Me too
yes ,  oh yes ,  I ,  nowadays ,  oh ,  they are so bothersome but with time ,  you do ,  one does ,  you get protected . 
Mhm . 
Oh ,  to me ,  in the past ,  I'd get lots of calls like everybody else but here ,  here in this phone service ,  they have a service in which you can ,  just
most of people don't even know it exists ,  in which ,  in fact ,  it's like a filter that blocks unwanted calls . 
Mhm .  Oh ,  yes ,  that does exist ?  oh ,  I didn't know . 
No ,  no ,  oh ,  I mean ,  that's the result because it's a system
Aha . 
in which if the system finds that there's a phone that is calling without an associated number , 
Mhm ,  mhm
so ,  it blocks it and the person that is calling so ,  they have to say the phone number ,  who they are ,  they have to ID themselves . 
Oh ,  I see ,  I see ,   I see . 
so ,  to me ,  if they call me and say this person is calling you do you want to take the call or not ? 
I understand
But it's not for the ,  oh ,  I don't mind ,  if I'm going to the telephone I don't care who it is ,  what stops it is that
these companies usually do everything through machines . 
yes ,  yes , 
So ,  when the machine is asked to provide a name ,  they can't and the call is dropped because no human being is making the call . 
Because they don't know how to answer . 
Exactly . 
Sure ,  sure ,  sure . 
So ,  my telephone doesn't even ring . 
Mm ,  no ,  that's a smart system .  Because ,  you don't lose calls that could be important .  But , 
And , 
but yes ,  exactly ,  eh ,  what gets me mad ,  is when the machine comes out .  Right ?  Because ,  if a person comes out and you can argue ,  well ,  you can still tell them something ,  but when the machine comes out ,  is very annoying ,  really . 
Aha .  No ,  is that everything is very automated . 
Mm ,  yes ,  yes . 
And ,  and is not the person who dials the numbers , 
Mm ,  mm
but a machine that dials the number .  And ,  and then ,  when there's someone available ,  then they get on the phone to talk . 
Mm ,  mm
Everything is very ,  very automated . 
Mm
And ,  the majority of the people ,  eh ,  don't even know that exists ,  that they could be enjoying that and be more calm . 
Mm .  Sure .  Sure ,  and ,  and do you get a lot of advertising through the mail ? 
Look ,  the regular mail ,  ah ,  that's ,  that's what bothers me the least . 
yes ,  yes ,  because you throw that away and that's it ,  right ?  mm ,  mm
yes ,  you throw it away and ,  done ,  yes .  Um ,  eh ,  the others ,  the others are more annoying .  As far as spam ,  what one ends up doing , 
you have less flexibility when it is a personal mail ,  so many people have multiple e 
Mhm
and
yes ,  yes
I use one for personal relationships to actual transactions with people who I know
Mhm ,  Mhm ,  mhm ,  mhm
I do not get spam ,  but everything I do online
Mhm
then I used another one
Okay ,  I have four different emails and I get spam in all of them . 
yes , 
is difficult to avoid sending you spam . 
yes
It comes to a point where just part of the routine . 
its a true sin right ? 
I wonder if anyone buys these things they offer . 
I like to delete without reading for the time lost
I like when stopped the offers . 
okay
but it is cheap for a person ,  and they go thousands . 
Sure .  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
I bought them ,  they already win . 
yes ,  yes
That's the sad thing . 
yes ,  is that ,  also ,  since it cost absolutely nothing to send an e mail .  And ,  you can have an automated system that sends an email to millions of people in a second , 
yes ,  Exactly . 
so ,  so ,  sure .  Is ,  is hard to fight against it ,  And ,  also ,  since is very easy to hide your identity in the internet and be very anonymous , 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
go after this people legally ,  also ,  well ,  is a job is ,  is an important job right ?  and it cost
yes .  And ,  what it's happening ,  is that as they put stronger laws in the United States , 
Mm . 
they are moving the operations to other countries . 
Yes .  Sure ,  they used it before ,  countries that have less control perhaps . 
yes , 
And ,  sure ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
And that's always going to exist ,  countries that don't care about controlling that . 
Mm ,  mm ,  yes ,  yes ,  Or that have other more important problems ,  perhaps , 
yes ,  exactly
Mm ,  And have you been many years here in the United States ? 
yes ,  I've been here many years ,  I came as a child ,  yes ,  from Cuba ,  yes . 
Mm .  Mm
yes ,  and and what part of Spain are you from ? 
I'm from Barcelona . 
Ah ,  how nice .  I was in Barcelona many years ago ,  and I liked it a lot . 
Mm .  I've only been here a here ,  and still ,  well , 
Es 
I have it very near right ?  my house and ,  and ,  well ,  my city ,  a but ,  well . 
Aha ,  You miss Barcelona a lot ? 
yes ,  well ,  I mean ,  I'm fine here ,  but ,  is not the same .  Barcelona .  And , 
Aha .  No ,  is not the same .  Are you here in the university ? 
yes ,  yes ,  yes .  I'm in the university ,  and I ,  I mean ,  I'm doing what I like , 
Aha . 
but , I don't know ,  well ,  you miss the people ,  the food .  I don't know ,  the rhythm of life ,  I don't know ,  going out to have coffee ,  or like that ,  that here ,  it's a little bit harder to find , 
those type of things . 
yes ,  yes ,  And are you a student at Penn ? 
But ,  well ,  yes yes ,  yes . 
Ah . 
Um ,  I'm doing a doctorate here . 
Ah ,  how nice ,  what topic . 
Mm ,  of linguistic ,  precisely . 
Ah . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes .  Well ,  I don't have it very clear what it is .  But ,  But ,  of linguistic . 
How interesting ,  yes .  And how ,  eh ,  eh ,  Philadelphia ,  what do you think of it ? 
Mm .  Well ,  I think is a very pleasant city to live in .  I mean ,  it has its nice places and has ,  I don't know ,  its movie theaters ,  its stores ,  its restaurants , 
Mm . 
and is not that is super nice ,  for maybe tourism ,  but I find it pleasant . 
Mm . 
And ,  I don't know ,  you have New York nearby , 
Mm . 
and ,  well ,  is more or less ,  mm ,  mm ,  cheaper perhaps also ,  than New York .  I mean , 
Ah ,  definitely more
ah ,  to live ,  and the rent and that , 
yes . 
then ,  fine ,  I'm pretty happy . 
And how many years are you going to be there ? 
Well ,  that depends ,  depends ,  um ,  they're five ,  a doctorate program . 
Ah . 
And ,  I'm on my second .  I mean that ,  I still have a bit left ,  yes ,  yes . 
Mm . 
Well ,  I have some friends that were in ,  in Cuba this summer . 
Oh ,  and what did you think of it ? 
Well ,  they'd tell me that they like the country a lot ,  that it is super beautiful ,  really beautiful ,  but what ,  well ,  they were surprised ,  no ?  About the lack of certain things there and
oh ,  the lack of freedom ,  isn't it ?  for the people ,  they can't do this ,  they can't do that ,  they treat tourists differently than their own people ,  isn't it ?  That there is like
Mhm . 
even ,  oh ,  they even have different transportation and stuff like that ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes .  So ,  what
Oh ,  that's it . 
well ,  they came back ,  they were surprised ,  no ?  But they really thought it was a beautiful and the people were quite nice .  Mhm . 
Oh ,  that's good ,  aha .  It's just that ,  most of those things are never said outside it . 
Mhm ,  mhm . 
the conditions under which people live there . 
Mhm ,  mhm . 
yes ,  it's like ,  how would you describe the current politics in Spain ? 
Well ,  man ,  I'm so happy about the political change that we just had about a year ago and mm ,  I don't know ,  the situation was ,  it was so tense ,  and before the terrorist attacks ,  it was very , 
it was complicated and then the terrorist attack just made it all worse . 
The what ? 
Oh ,  the terrorist attacks made it all ,  mm , 
Oh ,  yes ,  mhm . 
I don't know ,  they created more tension and then ,  well ,  the political change took place and now ,  well ,  the Socialists are in the government now and and I don't know ,  I'm quite happy about that ,  very ,  very much . 
the mood is more relaxed now ,  for example ,  the former Spanish President  wouldn't talk to the Basque Country's President s and now they do talk ,  I think that's fine . 
I don't know ,  the problem with the terrorism from the Basque country ,  seems to be nearing its end . 
What kind of solution ? 
Well ,  they are talking about ,  even right now ,  leaving the arms ,  well ,   I mean there is no
Oh ,  really ? 
serious initiative yet ,  but it has been said that there have been conversations between the government and ETA .  And it will probably take a long time
But ,  at least ,  I don't know ,  it has been a long long time without murderers ,  or bombs ,  and the situation seems to be a little more
Mm
more relaxed ,  I don't know .  Also ,  other measures have been taken ,  I don't know ,  quite ,  mm ,  like the gay marriage ,  and things like this .  I find them alright .  So ,  I am ,  I am happy with
and ,  how is the economy ? 
Well ,  mm ,  let's see ,  there was a big crisis in the beginning of the nineties ,  and things have recovered quite a lot ,  there is still
unemployment ,  much more than in the United States .  I think it's about a ten percent of unemployed .  I mean ,  yes , 
of unemployed ,  of strikers ? 
Hello , 
Good night , 
Good night ,  how ,  how are you ? 
Fine and you ?  I'm Carmen in Chicago ,  and you are ? 
Oh ,  Zulma from Texas
okay ,  do you know today's subject ? 
yes ,  yes
Okay ,  oh , 
oh , 
Should I start or should you ? 
oh ,  as you wish ,  yes
okay oh ,  I'm going to begin then
okay
Look ,  I get calls from the company
aha
offering me discounts of five minutes of long distance calls
aha
They also call me ,  oh ,  who is in charge of this phone ?  I'm supposed to be the one
aha
But I reply that I'm not at home ,  that I'm not ,  that the owner is not at the house ,  that she gets back at nine in the evening so that they stop bothering me . 
mhm
And that's it ,  after nine o'clock in the evening I know they won't call until the next day when they start calling
ah , 
And oh ,  so the next day when they start calling again ,  well what I do is that I let the machine take the calls . 
mhm
when I get home from work ,  my machine is full of messages ,  the
mm
the call identifier is full of messages oh ,  one time ,  a telephone company changed me to another company without my permission
oh ,  wow
so I had a problem with them
mh
they call me sometimes ,  so when they call me I don't pay attention to them ,  they tell me that I have won a prize but I know where I've participated to win things ,  so I don't listen to them
mhm ,  mhm , 
I get telemarketing calls every four or five days but since I  never answer them ,  they don't bother me
mhm ,  didn't you put your number in the ,  the do not call list ? 
yes ,  yes ,  I did but they keep on calling me
really ? 
yes , 
and how long ,  how long ago did you registered your number there ? 
so ,  oh ,  when the order came out saying that we could register them
aha
ah ,  I put it
And you haven't tried to put it again ? 
no , 
Because I had the same problem ,  I
aha
ah ,  first I just had a cellular
aha
and then I moved and my cellular didn't have good reception so I decided ah ,  Put a phone from the house and I had the same problem and I registered my number
aha
And after thirty days nobody called me again ,  nobody has called me again
aha ah .  Well I already did it once ,  this time I haven't done it but since I don't worry because the machine is what answers
aha , yes
And since when ,  an example ,  you call me and you know that the machine answers
mm
It means that I don't want to answer the phone ,  you are not going to call me again
mm
But they keep calling
yes ,  yes
I also receive a lot of letters in the mail of
mm
of credit cards of subscriptions for magazine
mm
I don't pay attention to it ,  what I do is that I break it the spam doesn't bother me because I don't use the computer for anything . 
mm
then I asked here ,  but yes I asked my daughter what she wanted and she said told me that she receives up to fifty spam emails
mm
And what she does is she erases it for example ,  she ah ,  something interest her to not have the email full
mm
then ah ,  I also receive many letters of insurance ,  life insurance from banks to see if I want to become a member but
yes
Since I don't answer the letters either ,  what I do is that I shred them
mm
because I'm scared that someone will steal my identity
Sure yes ,  because they have the address there . 
And ,  and things ,  sometimes they send me things ah , 
mm
personal letters to me
mm
and what I do is that ,  since it doesn't interest me ,  I shred them really shredded because I already know two or three people eh ,  who have had their identity stolen
aha ,  yes
that's the very reason because what the letters do is that they break them once
mh
And there they throw them to the trash can
mh
And they are not worried that There is people smarter than one
mh
that steal their identity and then How will you do to
yes ,  no ,  it's a problem yes ,  yes
To prove that you are that person
mhm
it's a lot ah ,  danger because of that
yes ,  I never ,  never
OK now I will let you speak
Of all the times that they have called you ,    have you ever decided to buy any of the products that they have offered
yes ,  ah ,  I have bought things ah ,  once I bought some shoes
mhm
and they turned out to be too small and I lost the money I lost the shoes because I couldn't exchange them either
mh
But lately I have bought things like for the kitchen to cook ,  pots
mh
ah ,  like
But ,  on television or on the phone ? 
On the phone not on television , 
aha
No , 
mh ahh ,  Well I I have never bought anything ,  eh ,  I mean
aha
If my phone company calls me or maybe another phone company and I didn't even understand that they had a better offer
aha
ah ,  yes for calling long distance for example ,  well I think that
aha
one time or another I have changed my my service but
aha
since well my number ,  ah and they started calling me to my cell phone too
aha
ah ,  about cruises ,  that I had wond a trip or something like that And ,  and I ralso registered my cell phone number in that in that list that the government has on the Internet so that they don't call you and since that moment
aha
they have not called me again ,  so I haven't had any other porblem
oh ,  wow ,  aha
But ,  but I think that the government should have eh ,  make laws that are stricter
aha ,  aha ,  aha
so that ,  they can't call the people like that because there are people that receive hundreds of calls
yes , 
per month and is a problem because there are many people that then have to buy ,  like you have to buy a call ,  a
identifier of ,  a machine ,  aha ,  aha , 
A machine aha ,  they have to invest money and there are people that can't invest the money in those type of things ,  then they have to be answering the phone all the time
aha ,  aha ,  aha ,  aha . 
And there are many times that ,  there are people that are vulnerable and that they call them and lie to them and many people fall for
ah ,  aha
the lies and spend a lot of money
Well just yesterday they gave in the news here in Chicago a lady that they called her on the phone ,  that she had won a trip to Puerto Rico
ah ,  aha
And that someone was going to go to her house for her to give them one hundred dollars ,  the person who called her told her
mm
he said look I'm going to send a guy who's like this ,  this ,  give him one hundred dollars he will give you some tickets ,  the tickets to Puerto Rico
And later you have to send seven hundred dollars
mm
ah ,  when we send you the application and she said ,  but I haven't applied anywhere to win those tickets
mm
That if she doesn't open her eyes
Uh um
I would have lost eight hundred dollars in a heartbeat
Uh um
But the person ,  so i said ,  the person was saying on TV ,  the lady said ,  oh ,  we have your social security number ,  we have your address ,  your name ,  and she said
"¿you have my social security number ?  ,  tell me"
Um
"i want to know where did i wrote my social security number" ,  and when she said that ,  the person hung up"
uh um
it was to see if the lady said "oh" ,  my social security number is this ,  this ,  this
Uh huh
To ,  to catch her
uh
but the lady was smarter ,  she told her "¿what do you mean you have my social security number ?  ,  tell me so i can now"
uh huh
and when she said that ,  the person hung up
yes
that's why if you ,  if you don't pay attention when they're talking to you on the phone ,  you give information that they'll use it for anything
uh huh ,  yes
You have to be very careful too
yes ,  yes there are many people that have not been as smart as that lady and they have given information to people ,  they have lost lots of money
yes ,  yes ,  yes like right now with what happened with Katrina
mhm
Well lots of people is benefitting with that money
yes ,  mhm
because they are taking other people ,  they take the papers to them as if they're authorised to collect money
mh mh
And because the people don't know what's going on they
mh
they give them money and when they go to ask no ,  no ,  we haven't sent anybody to collect money
mh
because we're receiving money in an institution and we're not sending people door to door
mh
but there's a lot ,  ah ,  many people that are very clever
yes , 
that if you don't open your eyes
mh
they ,  they take everything away
mh
one has to know who to give one's information to and one can't be giving personal information by phone because there are lots of people that are very clever
The problem is that there are also some companies that can sell the information you give
Right
Right ,  like ,  uh ,  and companies that you wouldn't think they're doing that
Right
Companies that sell products and stuff like that ,  and when you give them your address and your social security number and all that ,  they're valid companies ,  but they have the right to sell that information to other companies so they can call you
but ,  imagine that
And i think that the government should cancel that ,  because
Yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  because it's very annoying when they call your phone ,  there ,  there ,  there
Yes ,  yes
and ,  and trying to sell you things
Right ,  um
That you ,  that you don't want
Yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  it happened to me once ,  my credit card ,  which I've had for many years
Right
They called me and they talk about in ways you don't understand what they're saying
Right ,  right
And i understood the told me she was going to send me a product ,  and i would ,  for my credit card and that i could try it for thirty days and after that ,  if i didn't want it
Right
they would ,  they would call me to ask if i wanted to keep the product or if i wanted to cancel it
Right
And they never called me ,  and I thought that they'd canceled it ,  and after they sent me the bill
aha
For the product .   This is on my credit card ,  and I called them ,  and I told them that I didn't understand what they had told me
That they were going to call to ask me if I wanted to continue the service
aha
And ,  and the told me that ,  that they had told me really clearly .   That I had to call to cancel the service . 
wow
and this ,  that like and American Express that ,  that's a company that
aha ,  aha
That's really established and that doesn't commit fraud but even like this when the call you and tell you so quickly
aha ,  aha
and it's so you can't understand what they're
aha
saying ,  and so ,  they benefit from you not understanding
yes ,  yes ,  yes
and there are companies who are all responsible too ,  there are times that they do anything to keep taking money from people
aha ,  aha
hmm
That if you're not aware
yes , 
Mhm
Yes ,  one must not trust all the companies ,  yes
Yes yes ,  and to me ,  this telephone company changed my company ,  and when I received my telephone bill
Mhm
I see that it's another company ,  and I say that the only one that is authorizaed to change my company is me . 
Mhm
I was in Puerto Rico ,  I was not here
Mhm
My daughter was going to pay the bill and when she told me that they changed the company ,  she said Mom they changed your company ,  I came ,  when I came to Puerto Rico I went to the company and I told them
And they said that yes ,  I had given the authorization to change companies ,  I said how could I have given the authorization if I have
proof that I was in Puerto Rico
Mhm
And and it's supposed that you didn't ,  that you no ,  what is it ?  That I don't allow anyone change my company . 
Mhm
But they changed it ,  I don't know how they did it but they changed my company
mhm
And also they come to me by the phone ,  a lot of calls from Mexico ,  from
ah ,  yes
and I say who is making these calls to me ,  if I don't make calls to anywhere ,  the only
mhm
Good evening ,  this is Joe
Good evening ,  my name is Patrick ,  Patrick ,  Patrick
Patrick ? 
yes
How are you Patrick ? 
Fine ,  and you ? 
Fine ,  where are you calling from ? 
From Albuquerque ,  New Mexico
Oh ,  I call from Colorado ,  Denver Colorado .  So ,  the subject for tonight ,  like they said ,  is telemarketers and how they approach you on the phone and the internet
Do you connect the internet often ? 
Oh ,  yes ,  yes ,  mm ,  specially to study .  Oh yes ,  to look for articles for the classes of my ,  my
yes ,  what are you studying ? 
Pardon ? 
What are you studying ? 
Mm ,  nutrition
Oh ,  good
and Spanish ,  as well
yes .  I am also studying .  Now I am old ,  I keep studying .  Mm ,  I am studying to finish a bachelor in commercial administration
Oh ,  that's fine ,  that's fine
And ,  how are things over there ? 
Well
I haven't talked to you before ?  I think that we had already talked or something like that .  And I had talked with someone from ,  from
Albuquerque not too long ago . 
Well yes ,  well ,  perhaps ,  because I've only talked one time , 
Just one time ? 
one other time . 
Oh really ? 
yes . 
Oh . 
One time only . 
And ,  do they bother you a lot with telephone calls ,  selling you things ? 
Well ,  me not so much ,  but it does bother me a little . 
yes
But ,  my father ,  well he hates people like that . 
yes ,  I yes ,  I ,  I don't like it too much because they call at bad times although here in Colorado they have stricter laws as far as that .  If one gets on a list
they are not supposed to call you and bother you but yes in the internet ,  they do send one a lot of things ,  right ?  When one I don't know if it's happened to you sometime that you've opened a correspondence
of something that sounds interesting ,  suddenly you start getting a lot of other things ,  of advertising things like that .  That hasn't happened to you ? 
yes ,  yes ,  well when you are on the Internet ,  and
Apparently ,  And
well ,  yes ,  well yes . 
it makes you crazy when those things come So ,  one day ,  when I went on vacations from work ,  because I use the internet at work ,  it is part of my work , 
I was on vacations ,  and for two weeks ,  and when I came back I had more than four thousand five hundred emails
Four
that were
Four thousand five hundred
Four thousand five hundred ,  yes ,  and most of them were garbage . 
yes ,  it is like that . 
Imagine that .  And the bad thing is that I could not press delete to all as there were many important mails between the ,  those that were garbage . 
The Spam mail
So it is . 
And I have a hard time checking them all . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes you ,  you give your address ,  um ,  or your email no ,  to any company or something like that ,  well
For example ,  yes . 
and there
Well for example ,  like the school ,  for example ,  you are always looking for economical aid ,  so
they share
scholarship or something like that ,  right ? 
Ah ,  yes ,  that is true ,  also . 
If you fill something of that ,  suddenly many of those people share that information with other companies .  And the it begin to appear a huge amount of things of all kinds . 
yes .  Or also when
Because is a
well it's been a year and ,  and a half
Aha . 
I bought my house
yes . 
and of ,  of email ,  or or of
Oh , 
normal mail ,  or ,  or of of telephone calls well I received a bunch
yes
a lot ,  yes . 
And you do get a lot of telemarketing things in the regular mail ? 
yes ,  yes ,  of mortgage rate ,  like that of
yes ,  yes .  I had a house also and well when I got divorced ,  well it went to my ex wife but my name is still in , 
in the ,  in the system ,  as if my name was there .  Then I get many things like that of refinancing ,  that if I need money ,  I can go to this company or that
They drive one crazy with so many things that arrive
yes . 
And ,  and ,  how long do you have to finish your career ? 
Ah ,  well I have like five years left ,  also I'm going for a master ,  in the
Ah ,  so good . 
in the ,  what is it called ,  administration ? 
Yes
Yes ,  or an MBA ,  ¿right ? 
Yes ,  yes ,  that's my final goal ,  to get my MBA too ,  and do you have good [] there ?  ,  ¿what university are you attending there or planning to ? 
Oh ,  the University of New Mexico
¿Yeah ?  ,  that's the one that
yeah
Yeah ,  that's ,  that's good ,  very good ,  and ¿do you go there physically or on the internet too ? 
Physically now ,  uh ,  i have taken classes on the internet ,  but not on this semester ,  no
You're going only for .  .  .  ¿how many credits are you taking right now ? 
Right now i have like nineteen class hours ,  i mean nineteen credits ,  something like that ,  ¿right ?  ,  like
Yes
Four ,  six classes
¿And are you taking six classes at once ? 
Yes
Wow ,  that's tough
Yes
And ,  ¿do you have a family ? 
I have a daughter
Yeah ?  ,  me too
And i have ,  well ,  my parents live here too
yes ,  but helps her a lot ,  with the school ,  with the time . 
Well yes . 
How nice . 
they help me , 
What a blessing .  It's very good that you have the help and the support of the family . 
yes
yes ,  my ex  .  Here I am and my daughter who's five years old and well yes ,  she supports me a lot and I ,  and I feel happy that she understands my ,  the situation and
quite mature to be five years old .  She has a lot of understanding of the issues . 
yes ,  is true .  Mine ,  mine is also five years old ,  and is like she already knows everything and
yes The truth is that they are very fun when they are little like this because they are playful ,  curious .  To me ,  she's in the computer she knows how to use the mouse ,  the mouse well
That's how it is .  yes . 
she knows how to navigate good from one screen to another .  There are interactive kid's game to learn and she uses them a lot and learns a lot on the computer . 
But I also don't want for it to be very ,  that she gets too involved . 
yes . 
But many people do that and like they spend the whole time in front of the computer ,  and that's not good . 
yes .  They get lost there , 
yes .  Ah ,  I work the whole day in front of a computer ,  and ,  hm ,  part
Until
of my school is also on the computer and and no ,  and this is enough ,  more than enough for me .  And
Well yes ,  if you work in that yes .  You get home and
yes . 
and ,  no ,  and don't want to do something else . 
yes ,  already one doesn't want to know about that . 
yes . 
Well yes ,  that of the telemarketers in reality and I'm like your dad that it bothers me a lot because some times they are very persistent . 
Ah yes . 
Yesterday ,  for example one called me from Florida ,  offering that I had won something of hm ,  free tickets to Disney World to Universal and all that and
yes
and ,  and ,  well no ,  eh ,  it was a very cheap price but in reality the hotel and all they never mention to you that you have to pay the ticket to get there
yes . 
I mean ,  and later it comes out more expensive for you . 
Or they always call from ,  like you've won something
yes ,  eh
or you have won a prize or something like that
yes ,  like
but there you also have to pay those prizes
yes no ,  they hide everything until the end ,  then there suddenly you have to pay this if but ,  they go like that .  I don't even accept them no matter how attractive the offers look ,  I don't accept them . 
yes .  And have you gotten the ones from ,  from India ,  that already ,  already many ,  many many companies have their ,  um , 
 IT parm 
their telephone centers there in ,  there in India .  The people talk very very
Oh ,  yes .  Microsoft ,  for example , 
very strange ,  right ? 
I ,  the equipment ,  the one I have from school Microsoft which has the  XP ,  and has Excel and all those
yes . 
I had problems with the application ,  because it gave me problems with the  XP . 
Aha . 
Then I called and everyone I would talk to was from India . 
yes . 
And then ,  and with the accent very hard ,  very hard the accent
And is very hard to understand them ,  right ?  yes ,  the accent yes . 
and I was trying to understand him and and ,  nothing ,  I had ,  in a ,  one time I was seriously like four hours on the phone so they would fix my  XP on the computer because
something was wrong with the software and I was crazy and there and after they call to see if everything was good and I told them no ,  it wasn't good when
I have to be four hours on the phone ,  that's not good at all . 
yes ,  no ,  is not good at all . 
It was horrible .  I still remember that and I had to do it because it was from the school and I depend a lot on those applications working well . 
That if they don't work well then I have problems . 
yes , 
This for the school helps me a lot .  Then ,  and ,  do you use the computer a lot for school ?  To prepare the programs and that ? 
yes .  More to write my trials and ,  well some ,  some classes ,  like
yes . 
give ,  um ,  exams and tests ,  no ,  on the computer .  Have ,  have you heard of ,  of ,  um
Oh ,  yes . 
Webcity ,  is like is like a ,  some tools that the teachers use to give exams and
What is called ,  pardon ? 
Webcity is like a
Webcity ? 
yes
Ah ,  how interesting . 
is like the ,  the
For ,  take those exams there ? 
yes ,  just think that well last semester I took a psychology class
yes . 
and they gave me well ,  all my ,  my test through ,  through the ,  the internet
And how do you spell it ,  the Webcity ,  how do you say it ?  To check it . 
Um  WEB  S ,  no ,   CT ,   CT
 F ,   F what sorry ? 
 C of ,  ah ,  horse ,  and  T of  WEB  CT ,  web  CT
Oh ,  okay Eh ,  I'm going to check it out to see but yes ,  some yes ,  some things ,  for example I'm taking some  IT classes and then I have to take one of those exams ,  and in one of those places
Ah yes
Then there I take the exams to ,  to do the certification also .  There that well that wants to finish their master ,  that's wonderful . 
yes . 
And how long do you think it will take to finish ? 
I I think that if I do ,  do well and don't fail any classes well
Hello . 
Hello ?   Hello ,  how are you ? 
Fine ,  fine .   My name's Auria . 
Ah ,  I'm Jose . 
Jose ,  where are you from ,  Jose ? 
From Philadelphia . 
Ah ,  I'm in Atlanta . 
Ah ,  in Atlanta . 
yes . 
Ah ,  and what do you do in Atlanta ? 
Well it's really hot . 
Yes ,  I believe so ,  here it's been really hot but now it's hear ,  it's October so it's starting to get a bit cold . 
Well here it doesn't get cold until mid November or December sometimes the cold doesn't start . 
Ah ,  and a lot of humidity I imagine ,  right ? 
yes .   Even if I'm used to the humidity ,  I'm from Puerto Rico and I like humidity . 
Here ,  I've never ,  I'm not used to humidity so here when ,  here in Philadelphia there's humidity ,  uh ,  it's terrible ,  it's hot ,  it's humid ,  you don't want to be outside ,  right . 
yes . 
yes ,  but .   And what do you think about telemarketing and on the phone
Well ,  it doesn't bother me much because I think that the businesses have a right to try to sell their things in any way
possible .   The only times that it bothers me is when you're not interested in what they're calling you about . 
Mm . 
bothering . 
yes .  Well luckily I ,  came I had a cellular phone that I don't give to anyone ,  to no one ,  to no one then uh many times when I register
I always put my home telephone number because I live in the university and that's why I never receive calls or anything so
and the thing that my mom in the house has a program through the telephone company that if someone calls from a phone that is not identified
I mean that it doesn't give its identity or number ,  the number is blocked
yes . 
then the person has to state who it is ,  or say who it is then that
false ,  yes
yes then the company calls you want to receive a call from this person ,  but the thing is that the telemarketing here if the machines call
then when one answers automatically they put a person there ,  but with this recording if a machine calls the machine doesn't pass it
Exactly . 
then is perfect because my mom already hardly ever receives calls to the house number ,  she doesn't receive calls I don't receive calls and already everyone is happy ,  right ? 
yes . 
Well eh ,  yes ,  And and with the spam is terrible because if one gives the number ,  one's email on the internet they eat you up there already ,  they can throw away that address
Oh ,  forget about that . 
so many emails to one that it's impossible . 
yes ,  that's why I have more that one email account then when I'm searching for information but I don't know the website too much
Mm . 
well I give the ,  what I call my spam email
Uh .  yes . 
the spam e mail
yes .  yes .  And my mom also that now of of um but it was in Spanish and it was junk mail at hotmail dot com or something like that
yes .  No it's that it's terrible and no and and also it was with universities there has been a bit that there are computers that give eh because always there have been computers that go to the internet so
they go from one website to another .  looking for e mail addresses . 
yes . 
And then they in that way they make a list and then they sell them but now what they're doing is going to university directories because in general the students don't don't
in truth ,  those addresses it's not much ,  much Spam and then what they've been doing is uh looking ,  eh those directories are public so ,  they search and search until
in the university's e mail I'm receiving spam so now .  It's terrible . 
yes . 
But at then end ,  you haven't
But I I'm like ah ,  like
now yes . 
I'm today I was going to say that I'm like you ,  I have a cell phone so I don't receive many telemarketing calls ,  anyways
Mm . 
but they say that supposedly the cell phones they will jump them for the telemarketers
yes . 
I I don't know if that's true or not ,  but let's see if it comes to pass . 
and I say to myself .  they find many phone numbers in the phone book .  And none of the cell phones .  In truth they don't show up in guides . 
Because the guides ,  I don't think so ,  right ? 
But I think that what will be legal that the cell phone company can sell the list ,  if they want . 
Ah , 
that before it was illegal that the phones ,  you know ,  because you pay per call . 
yes . 
before well they didn't let cell phone companies do it but I read an article that now they will let them sell it if they want . 
Ah .   yes about this .   No but ,  this is worth a lot but if this
But this alone companies do . 
eh ,  what a thing . 
Because I know ,  I know when I had the Mitsubishi
Hmm . 
and I was financing the car through them ,  they sold my name in a lot of companies . 
Hmm .   Well which
So I saw an apartment and I received offers that were going to pay me one hundred thousand dollars for the mortgage that I have ,  and I don't even have this . 
mortgage but they sold it . 
that yes ,  yes .   No but ,  and what company was this ? 
Sorry ? 
the one that sold it .   What company was it that sold your number ? 
Mitsubishi
What's it called ? 
the finance company of Mitsubishi
Ah . 
Because I financed the car through them .  I didn't go to any other bank . 
Ah .  Okay ,  okay ,  okay . 
And later they started to but by mail at least ,  not by calls .  But
Uh uh . 
I started to receive a bunch of cards ,  of you know ,  credit card offers and offers to buy a car and I was approved and I was already approved for
the mortgage of my house and I don't even have a house . 
yes . 
and the way I know that it was from that company is because that company was the only one I gave my parent's address to
Mm
and then immediately I started to receive the letters at my parent's house
Mm . 
that . 
Mm . 
And since nobody else had my parent's house since I lived there ,  well it had to have been Mitsubishi . 
Mm .  yes .  yes .  Uh ,  yes the companies are yes but also is eh ,  is is it is hard because also the companies have the right to report their product however they want but also
many ,  has to respect the consumer too the
Exactly .  That's what I say .  The calls don't bother me so much
yes . 
nor the nor the spam nor the offer by mail as long as once I tell them especially ,  take me off your list
Hmm . 
and because of that it is supposed to do it ,  but they do not .  And then is when they keep calling that it bothers me
yes .  Well and also .  They well I don't know how .  how is the but also could be that they take you away from their list .  But they can
But for then they have sold the number yet .  To another person . 
Ah . 
And it would .  Therefore It is like . 
Well it is not necessarily because in my in my I
No no . 
office where I work sometimes I help to answer the telephone and American Express call everyday for an agent of mine . 
Hmm .  Ah yes . 
and he had told me he is not interested and that please take him out of the list but they still call him everyday . 
Hmm . 
Sometimes two or three times a day ,  call him . 
yes .  No and is also for the company ,  it is a waste of resources .  because if this man I don´t know how long ago other times in a day
obviously he is not interested and they could call others clients or other people that that I have a that are interested ,  right ? 
yes ,  but they think that eventually you can get tired of the calls and simply say yes to get out of that or something like that they think
yes
And it is like they say ,  there is someone after all who says yes . 
Hmm . 
but the thing is that as I told you I worked telemarketing for two months when I was at the university and I know that it is a law that
once they tell you take me off the list and don't call me back ,  they are supposed to do it ,  and if they don't do it ,  there's a fine of ten thousand dollars . 
Mm . 
By the FCC
And in general the
But what happens is that no one the majority of the people don't know about that and don't know the transactions that are necessary to report the company
Mm ,  And in general the telemarketers take the people off if
They are supposed to ,  some do it but other companies like American Express don't do it . 
if you tell them yes ?  Mm .  And your company in general did it or ? 
The Mitsubishi company
yes .  No ,  no the company where you worked for telemarketing
Oh yes .  Oh ,  yes They had some yes after I found out about that .  It has to be the exact word ,  take me off your list . 
Mm . 
they can't say ,  I'm not interested and hang up because they call you back . 
yes . 
And they can ,  they have their right to call you . 
Mm . 
But once a client tells you those words exactly ,  take me off your list .  It's supposed that we would mark them
Uh uh
clients as someone that couldn't be called so and it was a database that if they bought a new list and that person already appeared in the new list
Uh uh
the database could check the name and know that they couldn't just call this person like they wanted . 
Hmm . 
And they put on a block . 
Uh huh .   I asked myself how this do not call list worked
Well
because I
I know that you call this toll free number and you enroll and then I suppose that they take you off all the lists
Hmm .  But have you already been on it ?   Has it worked well ? 
well ,  I don't know because like I told you I have a cell phone so I haven't had problems with telemarketers
Hmm . 
so I haven't had to enroll . 
yes . 
but supposedly now there is going to be a toll free number for people with cell phones to enroll in too ,  because like I said they're going to release the cell numbers . 
Hmm .   Hmm .   yes ,  yes well I remember when it came out there was a lot of uproar and everyone talked about this and it was ,  but yeah ,  now I don't hear much about this
I didn't know if it had turned out well of if they kept calling these people ,  nothing in the news because much of the news
got something and so they put it on for several days and so then recently it disappeared ,  right .   You never see it anymore .   So I
yes . 
Hi ,  my name is Gloria . 
Gloria ,  hi ,  I'm Pilar . 
How are you ? 
Good ,  And you ? 
OK ,  I ,  eh ,  I really didn't understand what he said ,  I know that we are ,  ah ,  suppos  to talk about telemarketing . 
yes ,  About telemarketing ,  and about spam . 
Of the ,  eh ,  What ?  Of the what ? 
Spam . 
Oh ,  the spam ,  oh ,  that's what I thi  ah ,  OK ,  OK ,  OK of ,  of the Internet . 
yes .  yes . 
The Internet is like they ,  they ,  send you all those ads to buy . 
yes ,  to buy also things
Aha . 
almost always illegal ,  or I don't know . 
A  exactly .  OK ,  this ,  for me ,  really ,  I don't like spam ,  because ,  eh ,  you can't use your own computer ,  they are always sending you things ,  and they ,  they stop you
from doing your work that you're supposed to do . 
yes . 
Anyway ,  now you speak a bit ,  because I don't know what to say . 
Well No ,  eh ,  I have ,  well ,  from mai  the electronic mail that I have , 
Aha . 
it is one ,  eh ,  one of these ,  its is Hotmail ,  well I have several ,  and Yahoo
Aha
and of those I have a folder
Aha
of junk mail ,  of spam
Aha ,  aha
and there go all the mails ,  and honestly it has a filter that works really well ,  Because
really ? 
yes ,  because there are very few spam e mails that reach the ,  the ,  the inbox
Oh ,  so you have a block
Y  eh yes .  So
A block ,  something to block them ,  from you
yes ,  it filters them
Oh ,  filters ,  you see I have that ,  you know ,  I have that .  But
and places them there
since I ,  mm ,  sometimes they ask you if you want to answer a survey ,  and when you fill in the survey
yes
they get your name again
Mhm
and get in .  So ,  I don't ,  I have Optimum Online ,  this is what we have here in New York ,  eh ,  Optimum Online ,  in Long Island
yes
I can log in to my Email
I can use it because my little boy plays with the computer
Mhm
I believe that damages the computer too
well ,  it depends what game it is ,  but
then yes . 
they can download a virus and damage all of your programs
Exactly
and then destroy the computer that longer works
Exactly ,  every day I have virus on my computer ,  so I better go to the Library
printing does not work well in my computer ,  I have many parties as a clown ,  and always try to reach children
okay
So I go to the Library and I spend less
yes
the paper is better and I don´t have to get frustrated
yes ,  yes that is very good
so where are you from ? 
excuse me
yes what country are you from ? 
From Spain . 
Oh ,  from Spain ,  oh okay .   So ,  I'm butchering the Spanish .   Because ,  I'm Newyorkian .   I was born in Puerto Rico ,  but I grew up he 
Newyorkian ,  Newyorkian ,  I hadn't heard this . 
yes ,  I gre  Newyorkian ,  so , 
And the ,  the calls on ,  hmm ,  on the telephone ,  to try to sell you something ,  what do you think ? 
I also don't answer them .   Ah ,  no ,  eh ,  this isn't true .   I answer them because I do the same thing .   I do Medicaid ,  so ,  I sometimes call people I don't know ,  and , 
but I help them ,  you know ,  I tell them ,  no ,  I'm not interested .   So ,  sometimes they hook you ,  sometimes some of them and ,  and they talk badly to you .   But , 
Ah yeah ? 
normally ,  I talk really well to them because I ,  I did this for a time .   So ,  I find that ,  it's really hard to do this . 
You know , 
yes ,  I ,  I wasn't able to work in that .   But ,  one time , 
Aha . 
eh ,  I presented ,  like ,  I presented my resume ,  and
Aha . 
and it was an interview where they explained to you what it was like ,  and after ,  it's a hard job ,  really ,  because you're there for many hours , 
Aha .   Aha . 
and you have to call person after person after person . 
Aha . 
And there ,  and talk with people who ,  well ,  who tell you they're not interested , 
aha . 
But ,  there are people that get annoyed ,  that answer badly ,  and you have to swallow it all . 
Oh .  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
Because ,  well ,  I don't know the ones who are on the other side ,  some might not swallow it .  But ,  the majority have to answer for the ,  the company that they are calling ,  they can't start to , 
to treat the ,  the client .  Right ? 
Exactly ,  one has to take everything they tell you with a ,  with a smile . 
yes . 
You know ,  with a smile .  But ,  that ,  that job ,  was frustrating .  But ,  you know what ?  the more people you call ,  if you have an opening ,  like me who was calling through the insurance of ,  of
of health ,  I worked for a company . 
yes . 
Then ,  they had me calling .  And ,  what they did to me ,  was ,  put me with ,  eh ,  with the Hispanics in the Bronx .  Then ,  since they saw that I spoke Spanish , 
it made it easier .  Then ,  they would talk to me . 
yes . 
But ,  if you didn't speak Spanish ,  like they didn't want anything to do with you .  I don't know if it's because they didn't understand me ,  or ,  and I
Well ,  sure ,  yes ,  first ,  I think that ,  a little ,  that ,  they don't understand well .  But , 
Aha . 
but ,  I think that the Hispanic people ,  I don't know ,  like they open up more when ,  when they discover that the other person it happens to me too , 
yes ,  yes . 
also speaks the same language ,  like they already have something in common that ,  that wins you over ,  that How do you say it ?  Ingratiates ,  ingratiate ,  well ,  with the other person ,  and
Aha ,  aha , 
and that's why I think they respond better . 
yes ,  I think you are right ,  yes .  So ,  then ,  they would put me in the Hispanic community ,  so ,  each ,  lets say that ,  every fifty calls
I had two or three leads ,  it was good .  Two or three clients that we could call back ,  they gave us permission to call them back
yes . 
And ,  and that's what my friend told me ,  she told me that ,  the ,  the ,  the ,  oh ,  the Medicaid director ,  she told me
I picked up the phone book and I started to call people .  And it's true ,  I called three hundred people and I left ,  they said no ,  some did say yes . 
Oh ,  yes ,  well ,  that's what I was wondering about because , 
Well ,  I ,  e 
I ,  all of it ,  everyone I talked to , 
aha . 
everyone I've spoken to ,  all of them told me that they had never bought anything or been interested in buying stuff through the phone . 
Oh . 
And I was like ,  but ,  they must sell something ,  right ,  or they wouldn't get any profits
yes ,  aha .  They don't earn ,  they don't because lots of those jobs are through commission ,  you know ,  they pay you if you sell things . 
I see . 
So ,  I used to work and this man would give me eight Pesos per hour plus all the deals that I got him ,  he gave me ten Pesos for that or something .  But ,  I ,  it was frustrating ,  I mean ,  how am I going to earn
five hundred pesos per week ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  if I can , t I'd have to get lots and lots of people . 
Sure . 
Lots ,  it was impossible ,  and sometimes you can't sometimes ,  the people ,  lots of them have answering machines . 
Sure . 
So ,  it was difficult for them to call you back ,  some wouldn't pick up the phone ,  it was frustrating ,  I thought it was . 
yes ,  but . 
And ,  now I work in the school . 
and not just , 
And ,  in the
but not just the person who's calling ,  but also the company that is ,  that is selling a service , 
Exact 
that I don't know they must compensate very little ,  because very few people ,  very few people buy ,  the service ,  if they call . 
yes ,  I know ,  I know But ,  it sells ,  it sells ,  some people are lucky .  Is the one you have ,  like ,  there are many books that you can study
so that your voice is pleasing to the one you are calling . 
Ah ,  really ? 
Then ,  if your voice is you know that sometimes when they call you ,  they talk very fast , 
yes ,  extremely ,  yes . 
sometimes they put you to sleep ,  they put you to sleep ,  and you buy .  Really . 
In other words ,  that is the trick ?  Because ,  I laugh ,  I mean ,  but well it seems that ,  that they know they have very little time ,  because I'm going to hang up , 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
and they want to say everything possible in such little time . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes .  Because they give you a minute .  For them they give them the training ,  they give you a minute for you to convince , 
if you don't convince the client in a minute ,  no ,  no ,  you  don't sell anything .  So ,  in that minute ,  you have to make your ,  your presentation . 
Fast ,  one ,  two ,  three . 
Sure ,  sure . 
yes . 
But ,  anyway ,  is that ,  I think that the majority of the people ,  don't care ,  they are not listening ,  really ,  they are not even hearing ,  what you are saying
I know ,  I know ,  I know .  Because ,  I ,  in school , 
Is the bad thing . 
when I work in the school and the people call ,  they already start to talk fast .  I have this problem ,  and I tell them ,  wait a minute ,  I need your name , 
and when they call the machine at work ,  I don't even give the ,  there I really don't even give them the attention because I don't have time .  And ,  I know that the teachers don't have time either ,  and will call them back ,  I feel bad . 
Because ,  at work ,  they do call a lot .  In the school . 
yes . 
yes . 
And , 
And ,  and yes . 
And have you put your ,  your phone on the list of ,  on the list of ,  that there is for
Of do not call . 
yes ,  that . 
yes ,  you know that I worked in an agency that does that ,  that writes the name so they don't call ,  and they still call . 
yes ,  okay ,  I already know that . 
And ,  they say that now ,  they say that now ,  they are trying to call you on the cellular ,  that that it says it cost you a call . 
You know ,  it will cost you money ,  for them to call you . 
yes ,  sure .  And ,  and are they also calling the ,  the ? 
Cellulars ,  yes .  If I don't know the number ,  I don't get it . 
Ah . 
But also ,  since I have my clown business ,  maybe
It's a client who you lose . 
it could ,  yes ,  exactly . 
You never know . 
So ,  you never know ,  you know . 
To me ,  it's ,  I think it's bad that here ,  when I entered into this ,  I didn't believe it .   In Europe , 
So ,  aha . 
the mobile phone is like a land line .   When you ,  when they call you , 
Aha . 
they don't charge you ,  they charge the person who calls . 
Ah ,  okay . 
Sure ,  because ,  I don't understand because here you have to be like this ,  so my ,  on the land line
yes . 
they don't charge me when they call me .   Why are they going to charge me when the call my cell phone ? 
Aha .   I know ,  I know .   It's all this .   If you don't read the ,  the small things that the write in the contract , 
sometimes ,  my husband canceled before the two years ,  and he didn't read the contract ,  and he had to pay ,  I think it was two hundred ,  three hundred bucks , 
for not even having realized about the ,  the cancellation
Sure . 
Because ,  the service wasn't good .   So ,  I said , 
besides ,  when you sign you become obligated
yes ,  yes ,  exact
yes ,  yes ,  it's tremendous
yeah ,  but many people don't read all of that ,  you have to read all of it ,  all of it ,  all of it ,  because you never know what they're saying to you ,  that's why it would be better
to pay up front ,  instead of paying monthly ,  i think .  Many people are paying to use the phone first ,  and then ,  the calls they
make ,  are discounted
Uh huh
Pre paid ,  you can pay for it upfront
yes
Anyway ,  so i ,  I'm trying to cook ,  so ,  uh
Right
¿What else ?  ,  but i buy a lot over the internet ,  on the internet ,  i buy lots of stuff
Yeah ,  but not from the e mails they send to you ,  but when
No ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  but ,  uh ,  um ,  sometimes I'm afraid ,  you know ,  to put your card number ,  because you never know
Like people say
yeah ,  you have to be careful ,  yeah
Yes ,  they're connected
I only put it on websites that
Right
that i trust ,  which are few ,  i mean
Aha . 
no ,  no ,  I mean ,  I never go to a little web page ,  of someone that's selling something ,  there ,  small . 
Aha . 
It scares me ,  so .  Because ,  even if it's a secure transaction ,  and the number is not lost on the Internet , 
Aha
that ,  that company keeps your number ,  they already know your number . 
Exactly ,  yes .  And ,  they keep on sending you things ,  to see if you fall . 
Sure ,  they can ,  they can ,  t  they can sell your number to ,  to others ,  to ,  so that the other ones make charges
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
illegal .  Eh ,  you have to be careful with who has your card number . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
But ,  well .  And you  ? 
I am ,  m 
David ,  how are you ? 
Hello ,  fine fine fine ,  with whom am I speaking ?   What's your name ? 
David ,  yes ,  night to meet you ,  how are you ? 
David ,  Mayra ,  nice to meet you ,  fine ,  where are you talking from ? 
I'm calling from Connecticut
ah yes ,  and where are you from ? 
yes ,  I'm American ,  I was born in Brooklyn ,  New York
seriously ,  great ,  you speak really well
yes
you speak really
and you ,  where do you come from ? 
I'm from Mexico but I'm in Philadelphia
ah yes in Philadelphia
yes I study here
oh ,  okay ,  are you studying in the college or are you ? 
hmm ,  sorry ? 
are you in college ? 
yes ,  in the third year ,  junior
yes ,  oh you are a junior ,  oh that's cool
now ,  hmm ,  and what do you do ? 
I'm a mechanic more or less
mm okay
yes I have some friends you know my mechanics since I have a garage are Mexicans
mm
all I have like four ,  five guys that work with me
okay mm
from your country
and like that like that  ,  where did you learn Spanish ? 
I learned by force because since I was born here in the United States
mm
ah you know I started to speak in Spanish to tell you after seventeen years
alright okay
my parents are Puerto Rican but were born here
mm
then the Spanish that I learned is from the street more or less from my friends and from my wife who comes from Ecuador
okay ,  okay
and like that little by little there learning the language
how nice
and what else
and I don't know what the topic today was of marketing I never understand what the recording says it's terrible
this is what I can't understand because the recording doesn't come out well . 
yes
because I think it was telemarketing like if you're on the list or not in the list ,  they still call or something like that but at least you know for the phone ten minutes and you don't answer
yes anyway
with ,  with what you heard in the
the Fisher
of the ,  eh ,  the Fisher
so there's a ,  I think that the main office is at the university so there I found some signs from last time
ah
that there was another experiment like two years ago and so I participated in these and then they told me that there was this one in Spanish
ah ,  the other one was in English ,  no ? 
so yes they were English or in various other languages too
yes ,  ah yes ,  aha
so if you were someone who spoke Spanish or Chinese for example or Arabic they payed you more
oh yes
aha but that's it if you were lucky and knew someone
and this is the only band thing ,  that they always call me when I'm eating or going to sleep
hmm yes me too ,  this is why now I started to call ,  I'm doing the calls when I can
ah yes
because I don't know how long it will last I think there's nothing more we can do twenty ,  five calls ,  no ?   but they pay you more
and from
here like I know that while you talk more
yes
they pay you more for the calls
oh no
so aha so since I don't know how long this call has lasted ,  better the platform
sure
and I wait for the call when I can
ah
because besides my phone is always ringing ,  it's a tin can ,  so I go without answering and they talk to me each half hour so better
yes but they call me ,  they call me and when the other time when I answered the phone ,  then I put in the pin number
hmm
and the call left
ah seriously
everything and yeah so I say ,  okay ,  okay ,  ah the person said your number is this the other ,  I said the number and they said that's it ,  and hung up
okay how strange
yes but you know it's like it was late ,  it was like nine thirty more or less
hmm
like the other year when they called me it was like a little white wine ,  a Yank there who started to yell on the telephone why I was calling at night
I don't have anything to do
I I didn't call you you signed ,  you put your name on the list and they are calling you I didn't call you then like one
mm
getting out of that list that if the other that he got so mad ,  all mad and he hung up on me
okay well
so you know eh is how it is ,  then how many years have you been here in the country ? 
I've been in the country two years well I'm on my third
yes
barely and I'm living here alone in Philadelphia
ah yes ,  wow
mm well with friends from the university
sure ,  aha
my family was in Mexico and they just moved to Texas to San Antonio
ah yes the other time I was talking with a lady from San Antonio
mm yes ,  there is
yes I was asking her if there is a bunch but she says that will all the people that moved from the hurricanes that passed that San Antonio is getting very bad
ah really
aha she says that a lot of fights with the people from high school
ah
with the kids from there from the
is that is must be very hard organizing everything right now
yeah it is a problem is that if you don´t see it on TV
hmm
all Latins ,  no the people are poor and have they are very handsome and they want all for nothing you think that everone should
hmm
because they don´t have a house to live in but they knew about the storm but
yes yes yes
they stayed and that´s what happened
okay ,  ah how good I have not could talk to
yeah Have you been here for just two years ? 
pardon me ?  hmm just
you have just two years here ,  how do you like it ? 
I like it it is fine I have not get used to the weather ,  it is very cold
yes yes but which part .  which part of Mexico are you from ,  there in Mexico city
I do not understand about Mexico city then hmm then the summer is hot but not to much temperate
aha ,  of course
and the winter is cool instead of here that summer is horrible ,  is humid and it is very hot and after that there is cold all the time
hmm
so I have not get used but it is fine I am liking it more as times goes and know more the city and people and <I like everything more
of course ,  ah you have to , 
is nothing more than nothing more than in California there is my
Uh ,  in Miami ,  Miami has more or less the same weather
Yes ,  i don't know there ,  but i think i should
Right ,  there are great little things over there ,  oh ,  very cheap
Yes
And it's all Miami ,  it's Miami University College ,  Miami State University ,  Miami Florida ,  yes
Florida ,  yes ,  University of Florida and everything
Yeah ,  they have everything ,  but it's all schools ,  so ,  you know ,  you have to get to know it ,  it's very cool
you should study ,  yes
Look ,  if you're latino ,  everybody speaks Spanish there ,  everybody speaks spanish
Uh huh ,  uh huh
So ,  i don't know ,  i don't know ,  i don't
Ok ,  OK
because everyone can communicate over the phone so ,  what do you want to talk about ,  i mean ,  what do you want to talk about ,  what do you want to talk about
well ,  i don't ,  know ,  uh ,  how long uh ,  ¿where in Connecticut do you live ? 
¿come again ?  ,  I'm sorry ,  ¿what was that ? 
¿where do you live ? 
I live in Connecticut ,  uh ,  on New Havenm i don't know if you
Oh ,  New Haven ,  and ,  ¿have you always lived there ? 
Right ,  no ,  i have lived ,  i used to live in New York ,  uh ,  outside the Bronx ,  more or less ,  i lived over there by the city
Uh huh ,  uh huh ,  i like New York a lot too ,  it reminds me a lot of Mexico City
then that yes ,  ah
yes ,  in fact and since is like that is very vibrant there's a lot of energy and everything is happening and I like to go there
yes in the city is very dangerous
mm
I mean it depends what part if you go by Manhattan ,  Manhattan is very cool ,  okay
yes
there are many there many people from different countries
mm
then well to casually to see the people because there are many crazy people that walk in the streets you know
yes that too eh
yes
I mean I've also been lucky because I've only been in Manhattan
yes
and once I went into the Bronx and Queens by accident but nothing happened
mm oh then you are driving or you come by bus
what ? 
driving or in in in
no in bus
oh yes ah is cool but you know
yes
you have to know
hmm
but that that time is delayed for here for Philadelphia to Manhattan
it's only like two hours ,  besides there's ,  hmm ,  there's a bus that isn't the Greyhound ,  but the Chinese do it
yes oh yes yes yes
so you go from Chinatown to Chinatown
right ,  right ,  right
and it only costs ten dollars it's really cheap
oh that's not so bad then
hmm yes so many times we just go to New York every week end and yeah
oh ,  that's coot but little by little ,  so how is it going at school
well yes ,  I study chemical engineering
what are you choosing ,  oh yeah
so hmm ,  it's a little bit heard ,  and it's getting more difficult
yeah
I've just starting ,  yes ,  I'm just feeling ,  how difficult it will be
yeah yeah but you can change your major ,  no ? 
yes but this is my third year
yeah
so I've been taking engineering classes and science since I entered and now well ,  yeah better ,  I think it's worth more to finish
ah ah ,  but will you one are you thinking of staying here or do you return later to Mexico
I don't know I don't want to return to Mexico yet ,  I want to return but after several years
sure
and in the United States I like it but I don't love it so I am thinking it's better to work for a couple of years or study a masters or something
m m
and then go to Europe or some other country it seems to me that it would be nicer to live in another country I don't know Australia or something like that ,  some other thing
yes ,  eh you know in London is the same ,  more or less as in Manhattan ,  London
yes ,  yes
and it's the same as in Manhattan the the it has the same ,  it has a Times Square ,  you have buses eh all but you know only there is ,  there are not so many Hispanics there
no there's not many here , 
it's only only whites more ,  more or less whites and I know and English knows speak much English ,  by force
ah well yes I say I have been here before and I did my high school in English
aha
two years so I have been speaking English for about four years
aha
and well now now I'm used to it ,  I still have an accent and there are some words that I don't know
sure
but there's not so much difference now ,  I'm not so bad
ah that's cool but but little by little you learn more or less
mhm ,  yes
and the friendships ,  you begin to practice with your friends and that way you learn the words that they are not going to teach you in school you know little by little
But it made me happy that you like the United States ,  and you are going ,  it's that all the young people of yours come here to work because the ,  the Mexicans ,  all the Mexicans that I know
they like to work very hard and save their holidays and take them to their country and then never return . 
well if not ,  I believe that if they return ,  many return ,  or they use them there and it's in relation to working more
no ,  well ,  it's not if ,  but ,  no ,  it's not so easy to return again . 
no ,  it's not
so now like ,  like we are at war ,  eh closed the borders ,  then the people who are here ,  already here ,  can't go back or else they have to stay but
it's the problem I have ,  my friends here
mm . 
but he does not speak English well and has his two children that were born here and just barely bought a house
okay
well he said he was going back that he has property that he has a house that he was saving money to go back and is sorry he bought his house here . 
but doesn't want to return right now because it's not the same so
well yes ,  but you know that if you always miss it ,  or I mean ,  it's not easy to live here because you work hard and live well
yes of course
or I mean ,  even though ,  even though you may be working in a McDonald's you can live instead in Mexico you work equally hard ,  but enough money ,  but you always miss it ,  it's a very different lifestyle and I really miss the people and everything
yep ,  no if I went ,  I have gone to Mexico twice
mm ,  ah okay where
yes ,  I went to Tupulco and I went to Mexico City
okay
oh
Hello ? 
Betsy
Hello ? 
Ho Hello ? 
Aha . 
Who is it ? 
Eh ,  eh ,  I'm Brenda . 
Brenda ? 
yes B 
I think that we talked before ,  the ,  the first time that I talked . 
Aha . 
Anyways , 
I didn't understand the ,  the topic . 
About telemarketing you mean ? 
Something like that ,  about telemarketing ,  eh ,  well
Hmmm . 
eh ,  buying on ,  um ,  the internet ,  or on the telephone ? 
I only heard telemarketing .   The thing that is telemarketing
Oh .   Hmm . 
Hmm .   Well yes . 
My son works doing telemarketing
I also used to work in telemarketing . 
then ,  what did you use to do ? 
he is from Virginia
yes oh
I called him once
oh ,  okay
well ,  yeah
My son has worked for two different companies ,  selling magazines
Hm mm oh ,  okay
the second time I don´t remember but he didn´t like it very much
okay
It was the company because they used to treat him like a little baby
oh ,  okay
so there is many people
Hm mm . 
well ,  they try to control him
Hm mm
and you know
they try to make you sell you know in one hour you have to sell five and things like that . 
Mm . 
if you don't sell five ,  because I ,  what I did before was of newspaper ? 
Aha . 
And then ,  what is it called ,  And if you didn't sell seven per hour , 
Mm . 
they would decrease the ,  what I earned per hour ,  oh , 
Mm . 
I said ,  mm ,  okay , 
The salary ? 
Sorry . 
Ah ? 
They said ,  they say Sorry eh I don't think this job is for you ,  or something like that . 
Mm .  Look ,  is very ,  stressful ? 
Hm mm
There are many people that ,  leave ,  because of that because they can't ,  work in that ,  in that , 
In that type of job . 
Aha .  Because ,  they make it too hectic ,  and ,  and
Yeah . 
eh they always come with headaches ,  and ,  and , 
Aha . 
you know ,  and ,  and
Yeah ,  is true eh And there are ,  are people that ,  let's say ,  in an hour can sell seven newspapers ,  or whatever But the following hour
they are hanging up on you ,  they curse at you .  And they ,  or they scream at you
Hm mm .  Well ,  and now ,  is
Many times
because they said that ,  that now ,  eh ,  up to a certain hour of the day ,  they can be calling . 
Hm mm . 
After ,  I think seven ,  I don't know what time it is ,  they can't call your house at dinner time . 
yes . 
Then ,  Now they are saying of the cellular phones . 
Aha . 
that ,  that now they will be ,  will be calling
The cellulars
Aha .  Then ,  there is a ,  an internet address
Aha . 
that one can go to ,  to put their number ,  name ,  something like that ,  so that they don't call you . 
Aha Oh ,  how good . 
A ,  a number
But is in the United States , 
yes . 
no here in Canada
Yeah Well ,  eh ,  eh ,  no no idea .  Because all the places are different ,  but more
yes . 
more or less ,  everything comes by ,  by all sides . 
Hm mm ,  well yes . 
Then ,  here ,  like where I live ,  there's a lot of telemarketing
Hm mm
Is because in this area ,  since there are lots of tourists ,  there are many ,  there are a lot of service jobs ,  like of hotel
Hm mm
and ,  the restaurants ,  and , 
yes .  Hm mm
the stores .  SO there's a lot of ,  customer service . 
Hm mm
Then ,  the people here always you know they run away ,  they leave ,  you know there's a ,  how is that you say it ,  a big turn around
Hm mm
that many people ,  leave fast . 
yes .  Okay ,  because since
for the ,  for the people is the ,  you know ,  that the attitude of the customers ,  so to speak . 
Hm mm .  Okay . 
Because I work in a store ,  and ,  and and sometimes ,  I ,  tell them something and they take it the wrong way and ,  and they think that I am
that  that they're lying in life or something and I
Aha . 
but it what what I said ,  because she got mad and I don't know ,  you know
Sorry if she got mad
eh ,  aha ,  you know ,  it's that
Yeah
when they go ,  they get mad ,  and after they tell the manager
Hmmmm
So ,  one time they said it ,  and ,  and called my attention and said ,  but this ,  they told me ,  so ,  that
Aha . 
eh ,  so you had a discussion with someone ,  and me no because ,  a woman came and said that ,  eh ,  one of the workers was
had an attitude ,  and ,  and got fresh with ,  with her ,  and I ,  no ,  yes ,  I didn't have anything with
Aha .   Like discussing .

Aha .   Aha . 
like ,  I don't know ,  so ,  she said that ,  that I had a something with ,  with someone .   Or like ,  well ,  didn't go with me because I didn't
and I didn't say a  with ,  to anyone ,  you know ,  so ,  it was well ,  and she knows ,  ah ,  she said well ,  I ,  I
believed that ,  that it couldn't be this ,  but this is what she said to me but I ,  but they called our attention
so ,  you know ,  they pull your ear ,  or don't do this , 
Aha .   Yeah .   Hmmm . 
her more than ,  they want to find out what happened .  But the majority of the times they are ,  on the side of the workers . 
Hm mm .  Okay
Because the ,  the ,  sometimes the
because they know you .  They know how ,  how you are . 
Aha .  Aha .  Then ,  since the customers sometimes get , 
Aha . 
they get like  ,  you were working in the store ,  you have to find them this ,  and you have to do this for them ,  and you know
Aha . 
as if they were the king of Rome ,  and you have to do everything for them ,  you know . 
Yeah
And then ,  mm ,  but here ,  this ,  all this ,  customer service the majority of the things . 
Hm mm
The ones here if they don't work with ,  up front with the clients ,  they work on the phones in the back . 
yes ,  hm  mm
But always ,  more or less ,  one has to do something with the clients . 
Hm mm Okay ,  true Ah this phone . 
But
Well yes ,  hm mm And what else did they say ?  Shopping eh ,  buying online ? 
Eh ,  eh ,  Something like that I understood .  Is that he ,  since he has that strong accent ,  I don't understand him
Aha ,  and ,  is true .  I hardly understand him . 
No ,  then
Like ,  the ,  the pound sign .  I don't know ,  How you say it in Spanish ,  I don't even know which one this is ,  my God . 
Don't you see .  I know that
I know that it's the ,  the number ,  ah how was it . 
Bon that said is like the code ,  no . 
No ,  That you had to put the code ,  and and plus the ,  the sign of I don't know who . 
Aha . 
But is the ,  that one that's on the phone to your right ,  on par with the zero ,  to the right . 
Aha .  Well ,  I ,  I more or less got it because I remember the ,  the study they had before ,  that one had
In English . 
Ah ?  Aha . 
In English ?  Okay ,  okay in English it says it before . 
Aha .  So then I
And in English is pound ,  you know what pound is . 
Aha ,  Aha .  So then I remembered . 
Aha . 
Yeah .  Well I wait ,  I think ,  the number of of the ,  okay ,  so that has to be the number plus the pound
Hm mm
so there ,  I entered it .  and it was that
Okay because the first time what I did was put the star ,  and they said no ,  is you wrong name ,  something like that ,  ah my God . 
Hmm . 
and now that put ah ,  it must be the other one

Aha ,  Chinese . 
That was what he said
He was Chinese ,  Oh my God . 
That was what he said but he does not sound like if he was Chinese . 
Oh . 
It could be because you don´t understand him . 
With the one you were talking ,  or ,  or with the one who is in the machine ? 
with the one I ,  with the one I was talking ,  he said that ,  that he
Oh ,  aha . 
the one who is in the machine is Chinese . 
Are you serious ? 
Hmm ,  because as ,  well ,  you do not understand anything .

Hm mm Aha . 
So why doesn't he say it in English . 
Yes ,  is true . 
because and well ,  I understand English better than Spanish . 
Me too . 
So aha . 
Because the accent that the machine has is ,  ah ,  what did it say
Aha .  Or ,  or if not ,  they should put ,  if ,  if you want to hear the instruction in Spanish ,  press one . 
Aha ,  yes .  Press one ,  or two or whatever . 
Aha .  If you want to hear it in English ,  well press two . 
Well what it is in Spanish ,  press d  d  d  three ,  or whatever . 
Ah ,  aha .  Like that it gives the ,  the
Because like that is easier to hear the instructions . 
Aha .  Like that it gives ,  one the choice of ,  of how one wants to hear it . 
That I don't know how it has learned Spanish
Then ,  Aha .  Then ,  aha . 
Well yes . 
Ah .   So ,  the other day I was ,  I made a call ,  and the ,  and the recorder ,  eh ,  in the recording the girl said

I've been here for seventeen years
and you arrived ,  you've been there for seventeen years ? 
ah ?   here ,  yes ,  hmm

yes aha
ah ,  so good ,  and ,  how has it gone with the program ,  do they call you every day ? 
yes ,  every day ,  almost every day ,  sometimes I haven't been there so the machine picks up but
ah
they get it because I haven't ,  I haven't gone out but ,  they're discussing now ,  what is it ?   About buying on the internet and the service of
aha ,  by ,  yes ,  by telephone ,  buying by telephone ,  no ? 
aha ,  yeah
that if you've lost things ,  for me a little bit but if I've bought something ,  above all
hmm no ,  I don't buy anything by telephone the only thing I've ordered on internet is travel
ah yes ,  I've never bought travel ,  I've bought other things on Ebay
yea ah no ,  I don't like Ebay
Ebay ,  well ,  they're really idiots ,  but I gave in ,  and
no ,  they sometimes get a lot of people with this stupid Ebay thing
yes ,  no ?   They changed me interest because
no ,  no
my payment was delayed ,  and I told them that ,  that I was going to pay money order because I don't like these credit cards and
hmm yes well ,  they remember the information on the ,  it's another of the things that I don't like about buying on the internet
hmm
there you have to give your credit information that doesn't
but it there ,  no ,  and did you buy 
like ,  it's not very trustworthy for me ,  only people ,  I buy tickets for JetBlue and companies ,  American Airlines ,  companies that I know more ,  you know ? 
would be but
and ,  aha ,  ah
like that ,  things that offer like on ebay and ,  no no ,  here a man bought a car and ,  and they dismissed him ,  they took five thousand dollars from him
not me ,  you know ?  how can it be ? 
yes ,  they told him to send the five thousand dollars ,  they sent him
and they didn't send him anything ?  and the
no ,  nothing ,  no the guy didn't even exist then well he stayed without money
and ,  oh ,  and then ,  what ,  they didn't return it to him ? 
no ,  no because he sent a certified check ,  the guy changes on behalf of another person who doesn't exist with ,  with fake papers
goodness and the charge appeared but the person is not known
exactly no the people where he said that he had ,  the car dealer never existed
like ,  and one that thinks that with a check well ,  you can trace ,  a friend of mine it happened
aha
similar but with tickets from ,  but not like that of her searching but rather that they offered her a cruise ,  right ? 
aha
for ,  for her and the husband ,  but a company like that with name and address and phone and all ,  then she like put it through her credit card ,  to reserve
oh my god
more like five hundred ,  a thousand ,  I don't know ,  a part of ,  of the tickets ,  later when they went to call the travel agency and that they told her that didn't exist
and look nor alive nor dead they returned it ,  what happens is that the credit cards it seems that they do give a part to the person right ? 
if ,  if you ,  if you claim it withing a certain time ,  that they have a time limit for you to make the statement
mm
they give you back a part of it ,  yes ,  aha
oh yes ,  your card shows that something that you paid before ,  or something like that was reimbursed ,  but ,  she paid two things and then the other thing she paid it in a different way ,  so no
well ,  they pick his information to use it as they want ,  that's shy I'm telling you that this service of
I don't like it ,  I don't like personals either ,  but I'd like to have one to look for a job ,  to post my CV online I think that's a good service
yes ,  well ,  I use it for that too and
the Internet ,  and the
and one time ,  I was scammed by the fishers scammers ,  I think that's their name . 
aha
they send you an urgent email in which you have to provide your information for MSN as I use MSN to connect to the internet . 
mm
so ,  it said that MSN needed to update my information ,  so the foolish I am ,  started putting it and ,  what did I do ?  I included my bank account
so ,  then it said that I had to put  my PIN ,  please put your PIN number and then I realized ,  and I thought ,  I don't like that ,  nobody wants to know it ,  why do they have to know my PIN number ? 
exactly ,  aha
so ,  I stopped there and I called MSN through the phone and they told me ,  no mam ,  no
that's personal info ,  aha
it's not us ,  please change your password ,  you know ,  the password to log in and all of that
aha ,  the ID ,  aha
so ,  I had to change all of it ,  change the bank account , 
yes ,  they caught a lot of people a lot of people fell into that trap ,  it said that your bank needed to update your info or I don't know what else
aha
and it was to steal your identity and everything from people
uye ,  I ,  I got scared
this is why I don't like it ,  on the telephone ,  well ,  what have I bought on the telephone ,  have I asked for anything ont he tel  ?   I don't think I've ordered
pizza ,  pizza is the only thing I order on the telephone ,  pizza and
no
and Chinese rice

on the telephone I haven't bought anything ,  anything
it makes me laugh ,  yes ,  I buy pizza and sandwiches ,  the only thing I bought on the telephone ,  right ?   It was a special that ,  only the computer
that came out from Hewlett Packard that I ,  I loved this brand and since I had clothes that ,  that they already sold me a scam
hmm , 
and I fell for it and 
this has happened to you ,  eh ? 
by watching the Hispanic channel ,  and there were some things and you had to go and ask on your computer ,  on sale ,  the special ,  six hundred dollars ,  everything ,  well
aha ,  these old computers that they repare
yes
aha ,  yes ,  they change the memory and all that
yes but it only lasted two months , 
we bought one for ,  well ,  I don't ,  my boyfriend bought it ,  but ,  he bought it from Dell and it's really good the one we're using now
ah ,  well yes ,  is a good brand
yes but you know that ,  that you paid it like that little by little and he ordered it through ,  through the ,  he saw the ad on TV and then
I 
he filled it out on the ,  aha ,  he filled it out on the internet and he bought it and it has come out good
and they gave him partial payments
aha ,  yes exactly ,  he paid I think that thirty seven dollars it was something like that
ah how good ,  ah no ,  well is , 
aha ,  some silly thing ,  but he finished paying it
ah well great ,  but for me it came out ,  I bought the
ah it came out damaged ? 
no that of the ,  of the Hispanics ,  it came out for getting into ,  for seeing those and I paid them six hundred
and they didn't return anything ? 
no the company disappeared afterwards ,  all the telephone numbers others came out ,  there
ah my God yes that all of those are searchers ,  this people don't know ,  don't know what else to invent of garbage to
with advertisement mm
get money from the people
in Telemundo they got from me ,  and the ,  okay now the one I bought from Hewlett Packard no ,  that one was ,  a brand name and guaranteed
yes ,  those are good ,  aha ,  aha
that one arrived perfect ,  and and How did I buy the Gateway one ah well ,  you remember there were some offers that you  called Gateway ?  and they approved me
I gave my son a Gateway one but that one ,  was paid and nothing happened
no but these are companies that you can trust ,  like ,  I see things that ,  these announcements
ah ,  aha
As pretty turuliles and these ,  these things that they offer like a trip
hmm , 
look one of my friends was told that she had won a trip ,  there ,  where did she go ? 
how will it happen ? 
and until a girl from here was , I was laughing because after my friend gave it to me I saw the girl from
I think it was on ,  on channel three who was saying that she and her husband were sent one of these papers that said that they'd won a vacation to Mexico and ,  no
in the mail ? 
and so ,  eh ,  no ,  via fax
ah good ,  ah
via fax ,  so they sent you that you've won a trip of whatever ,  you call this number and they tell you now and she said that they painted it as wonderful ,  and so when she got to
the place where the hotel was ,  it was a terrible place ,  the pool didn't have water ,  it was full of mud , 
ah nice ,  and ,  but they were able to go to Mexico and everything ? 
yes ,  they were able to go ,  but I tell you ,  they bought it ,  but they said that ,  they didn't have anything for free ,  so they ended up spending almost three thousand dollars
they gave them ,  um ,  sure ,  no vacation
for the tele ,  ah ,  they robbed them ,  ah ,  they had to pay the taxes ,  they charged them a lot of taxes for the hotel so they had to pay ,  it didn't include tips or
a horrible room
aha ,  not he room ,  she ,  well ,  she told everything because since she's a reporter well she made a full report
there's
then ,  is ,  she sat as if they were in the moca ?  when she arrived there ,  she went on a cruise that they offered she says the ship ,  she arrived and I was afraid for her to take it because I thought that the ship was going to fall apart from how rotten it was
a little boat there
flabbergasted ,  aha ,  aha
cheaply painted ,  ah how horrible
well ,  she says that horrible ,  the food she says that ,  she says look I even didn't dare to eat because I thought I was going to be poisoned
and they ended up paying quite a lot more money ,  spending a lot of money ,  because then already ,  well they didn't dare ,  they got out of it and well they got on a plane and got
mm they passed by a
to another place ,  but the girl  ,  I was laughing when I saw the girl ,  that she's a reporter ,  you know ,  they made a fool of her ,  but she ,  she filmed everything ,  she filmed the ,  the room if you saw the doors the
ah
the doors below all coming apart and with ,  like with that mold ,  horrible ,  horrible
of aluminum mm one gets sick from that ,  better to leave from there because possible that
yes that's why that of ,  of buying things that they send me by fax and that they send me offers of those
I erase them ,  now they send me of Carnival Cruise ,  Carnival Cruise . 
ah okay ,  and ,  and not of ,  you know when ?  what I ,  what I do is I go to where it says
is super cheap
when they say I start to read it there ,  and then if you read the fine print it tells you ,  this offer is not ,  is not ,   affiliated
to a Carnival Cruise lines ,  and as soon as I see that is not affiliated I forget it that I remove them
ah ,  it says that is not ? 
if ,  if you read the really fine prints ,  is that they are smart ,  they   is like ,  I don't know if you've seen on the computer
mm mm

I've talked with ,  with Cubans ,  Puerto Ricans and well ,  I think Cubans and Puerto Ricans only I think
Ah ,  no me too ,  just yesterday I was talking with ,  with a Spaniard .

ah ,  no mine was ,  was with a girl . 
aha
Eh ,  and ,  and ,  and and from what country ?  ah ,  yes from Peru you told me . 
mm
And how nice ,  Peru must be interesting . 
aha
I've never had the chance to go . 
no yes ,  yes ,  no ,  like all countries all places have something interesting
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes , 
have something interesting ,  right ? 
Such a rich patrimony that Peru has . 
sure ,  eh ,  the culture is very
yes ,  and how many years have you been here Norma ? 
ah ten years
ah eh ,  How's Atlanta ,  do you like it ? 
yes ,  more or less ,  right ?  although I'm a little bored but well
ah
because I'm used to traveling everywhere  ,  since I belong to a religious community
ah
then they were always sending me to different places .  But now ,  well ,  I'm here because I got married and have my kids .  so ,  and my husband works here ,  so
ah ,  and how many kids do you have ? 
I have two one is seven and the other is three
ah ,  little . 
aha
aha ah ,  d  e  y 
and you ,  what ,  do you have kids ? 
eh ,  I have three but
already adults . 
they are already ,  they are already big yes .  One already works and the other two are in the university . 
mm
So ,  so I don't have kids in the house anymore
ah ,  well more peaceful , 
yes ,  yes ,  is already more peaceful ,  and how is Atlanta ?  I was in Atlanta one or two time but it was years and years and years ago
ah ,  really ? 
and since then I know it has grown a lot and changed a lot .  How is it ,  what do you think about it ? 
ah ,  yes ,  well Atlanta is a big city ,  right ? 
yes
compared to the cities in Peru
ah
no is very big here in ,  no ,  is the biggest city of ,  of the southeast so
of course ,  mm
mm so is ,  yes ,  really there are people ,  a lot of Hispanics ,  right ?  there are people from everywhere
mm ,  yes ,  yes logically yes
aha
yes ,  well ,  they wanted us to talk of
of marketing ,  spam ,  spam
of yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes all those forms of marketing so annoying . 
yes ,  well ,  well it bothers one ask for something and they call and they call and all the time and they want to sell you something . 
yes Look I ,  you should ask in your telephone company if they have something
aha
that mine offers ,  that I have since a few years ago and here
mm
no ,  those sales calls don't come in . 
ah ,  they don't come in ? 
they don't come in ,  don't come in .  Is
mm
is a very good thing and that the people ,  the majority of the people don't even know it exists . 
mm mm
Eh ,  no ,  I don't remember what is called
mm
eh ,  what ,  what they call the service but is a service which recognizes when calls come in when there's no person's name there ,  eh ,  it only gives the number
but a name associated with the number is not given . 
aha
And the the calls from these of marketign th  the normal thing is that ,  that the number be given but without an associated name . 
aha
And then when the system recognises that
it blocks
so ,  well ,  s  eh ,  it doesn't exactly block what so it comes out to the phone a recording answers telling you to identify yourself . 
ah ,  OK
But ,  the thing is not that I reach the phone and ,  and ,  they tell me that it's from a certain place and that I have to bother to say
mhm
that no ,  it's something much better than that .  Because
ah ,  that's good ,  look
because the thing is that ,  that all these eh ,  eh ,  marketing systems are done by machine and that there is a machine
yes ,  yes ,  yes they do it by computer ,  aha
yes ,  yes ,  that ,  that the compute is programmed to dial a number and number ,  and number ,  and number ,  and number
aha
and then the person picks up when there's already someone on the phone . 
mhm
So when my recording answers to identify
mhm
the call gets lost because it's just a computer . 
mhm ah ,  that's a ,  it's a very good meassure ,  really . 
Is good ,  is good ,  yes .  That yes ,  yes ,  that
yes
what a shame ,  that the majority of the people don't know it exists because it's given me a lot of peace during all these years . 
yes I think that here the company that I think it is is bell south here in the south
aha
also has ,  but is that I say that it has to apply to something ,  or pay something more .  something like that
ah I think that it's three of four dollars , 
yes ,  for that type of service . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes it's really worth . 
mm
and
Well ,  they don't call me much to sell me ,  some yes twice ,  even
ah ,  how nice
three times a week ,  something like that ,  yes ,  but well ,  and since always the connection ,  right ?  like you say is a computer that calls then I hold the phone and answer ,  I have the phone and nobody ,  nobody answers me .  But I don't know
then I hang up because I know that it's a call of right ?  because if it's a person right there they answer you say hello and right there they answer . 
mm
that's how it is .  Look ,  and do you receive a lot of spam ? 
Well ,  and the computer ? 
yes
yes there's always a lot of advertisement ,  right ?  there are a lot of things .  But one ,  I how you say delete them
ah ,  delete yes
delete
yes ,  yes ,  yes I erase them ,  mm
yes no I erase them and ,  and and the problem ended
yes ,  like that ,  yes
no ,  but ,  but always ,  sometimes is annoying and sometimes they send to many many things scams how they call it
com 
that they try to deceive you in some businesses and things like that .  Those are dangerous right ?  Even by phone ,  they also do that type of
ah ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  aha
That type of right ?  of work .  One has to be careful with those things of advertisements ,  mm
yes ,  and ,  and mm ,  and when one enters into any international thing
mm
one ,  one of the big scams are all the ,  the scams from Nigeria . 
mm ,  ah ,  really ? 
yes ,  oh ,  that ,  I read somewhere that the ,  those scams was the second industry of Nigeria after the oil . 
ah ,  really ?  I can't believe it ,  how awful
ah ,  yes ,  yes no ,  that's notorious . 
yes ,  not too long ago I received some ,  eh ,  some letters that a lawyer from ,  from Africa I don't know ,  Nigeria or I don't know ,  another country
yes
but it was in Africa had been ,  had been the ,  the lawyer of this very rich family that had a lot of possessions and that well
aha ,  aha
was looking for the relatives and that has come to the conclusion that I ,  my family is one of the ,  right ?  the ones related with that
rich family that there's nobody from the inheritance that he has to distribute then he has to I have to contact him and give him my
information ,  something like that , 
ah
Okay but that ,  that you can say ,  one immediately knows that is a
yes yes ,  yes ,  that ,  that's typical of those scams from Nigeria . 
a lie ,  right ?  because one doesn't have ,  I say from where ,  I don't have any connection with any African
no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  mm ,  mm
I don't have African family if they said South America ,  well maybe I start to think . 
yes ,  ah ,  yes
But ,  in Africa
is like that ,  yes
No ,  in Africa no ,  that already ,  is already completely ,  no ,  is a lie . 
yes
That they try to deceive you . 
yes ,  yes ,  and it's incredible that there really are people that let themselves
mm
be scammed by those things . 
aha yes that is ,  is very dangerous right ?  there are people that are in desperate situation or I don't know what
yes
aha they want to see ,  try their luck . 
and see and ,  how did you know about this study ?   because ,  I knew because it's crazy here ,  but how ,  it called my attention that I've talked with people
in Chicago ,  in Connecticut ,  in Florida
Ah ,  I knew because I enrolled in a survey company ,  the survey scout . 
ah , 
I enrolled in the company ,  hmm ,  I payed them thirty dollars so that they could send me their whole list of surveys ,  of their companies
aha
who do surveys to do the surveys ,  no ?   and
yes ,  yes ,  just in these days I was seeing survey scout ,  is it worth it ? 
and respond .   yes ,  more or less .   no ?   because no ,  like I don't know ,  my personal case is that I really didn't get what I wanted to get ,  no ? 
Many times ,  ah ,  I find no ?   a survey ,  or a study that pays me thirty dollars but every now and then ,  not every day . 
And many times you don't qualify because ,  eh they ask for different people ,  no ?   of a certain age
aha ,  aha
or the ,  people for example who are professionals .   I ,  I'm a home maker and I'm a landlady ,  no ?   or people who
have ,  I don't know ,  teenage kids ,  and I have small kids .   A question of ,  they're different
aha ,  aha ,  aha
no ?   conditions that you have to fill .   And if you ju  ,  no ,  yes ,  if you have all the requisites and qualify and do the study and they pay you thirty dollars ,  and well if they disqualify you and don't
and how many do you think that you do a year ? 
well ,  no ,  well ,  not many really .   Well ,  recently these people are really lucky because to me ,  not really ,  I don't get many .   Sometimes I accumulate ,  no ?   I accumulate for
points ,  my points and I can pass them for money in another company ,  for example there's one that well I accumulate my points and I can change them for money .  For one thousand five hundred
points they give me fifty dollars . 
ah
Well ,  but that's also the same case right ?  they send you surveys but you have to qualify for those surveys .  yes ,  for ,  with the requirements ,  if not , no . 
mm yes ,  here ,  here in Philadelphia there's a ,  a ,  eh one of those groups that does ,  eh ,  group discussion
aha
and ,  and I signed up with them because a friend recommended it . 
aha
And ,  and they would call me and they would call me and they would call me and they asked me a bunch of questions and there was always something
That would disqualify you . 
that would make ,  exactly ,  yes . 
yes is what happens to me too I've only done a study up to now that , 
yes
that they paid me one hundred fifty dollars
ah
right ?  but only  this was last year
ah
no ,  and that ,  only that one hundred fifty dollars a year is not
I don't know yes
is not much ,  is nothing . 
no yes because I've just been seeing these things of ,  of ,  of
mm
that sell the information of the surveys that say that you can make thousands a month
ah ,  yes ,  but that's for ,  only so that you register in that I think
ah , 
Because I also registered right ?  there and paid them thirty dollars .  Well ,  also thirty dollars is not a lot right ?  and they sent me the list of
yes ,  thirty is not a lot . 
Hi ,  hi
Hello good ,  Who am I talking to ? 
ah ,  you're talking to Vicente
Vicente
yes from New York ,  and where are you from ? 
ah I'm in Georgia ,  Paulina
in Georgia
yes ,  where are you from Vicente ? 
ah
Where are you from ? 
I ,  I'm from Panama
from Panama
yes ,  I spoke with a previous person ,  from Georgia ,  I don't remember
I from Chile ,  ah yes
yes ,  yes ,  look from ,  the matter that we have to talk about ,  I didn't understand very well because the machine was speaking with
yes ,  it spoke I think about ,  about marketing of
of spam and telemarketing
of ,  yes what happens with if you buy things through the internet and email that come to you even no ,  no
well it's ,  that's what here ,  it's saying that if you buy ,  not only is speaking about telemarketing and spam but also if they bought something like
yes
ah ,  yes we bought something like that
or by phone when they call and offer you things
and they offer things like ah
yes
if they sell
I generally don't ,  I don't even give them a chance of
you don't buy things like that
not unless I'm the one looking for the thing ,  but I like it when they offer me ,  yes ,  yes
when they call you and they offer you ah
I buy a lot through the Internet but when I'm looking
ah ,  exactly that is the with me if they call me to tell me something no ,  but if I see something on television ,  in a magazine ,  in another place
and things that that I need right or things that I think that I want to know about that thing or that can is of the ,  is of health ,  something like that for health
maybe I buy it ,  do you understand ? 
eh yes
or something that I already know ,  do you understand ? 
yes
if you call me and you are offering me something maybe something for health that I already know that it's a medi  a pill or whatever right
if I already know of that ,  of that ,  that what you're talking or that you're offering me maybe I will buy it if the price is good
yes
but is for  very rarely that I do it ,  do you understand me ? 
yes I generally no ,  I don't buy a lot of things if they call me ,  only because there are so many of these who call and get your information and after no ,  they're false
yes
and also want information ,  because many of those who talk to you are offering something on the internet or over the phone ,  many times they want your credit card number
yes credit
and you ,  you have to stay there ,  because you want ,  do you understand what I'm saying ? 
sure
you have to be careful with this
yes well
and sometimes they act like they're from a big company ,  a major company
yeah
and they aren't
sure
so you have to be very
you need to do an investigation on the other side
yes I un 
this is what I do ,  and whenever I go to buy something on the internet ,  or something like that I go to see those sites where the
they put a rating ,  how do you say rating ?   that the
aha
well they say no ,  they have the opinions of people who have used this company and say ,  this wasn't a good company ,  or they don't fail ,  they don't send the things ,  or they send it late or whatever
and very late
I do that ,  I see that first and see how the company sounds and later I use it
ah
that's what we do when we buy things on the internet what things  what type of things have you bought
well ,  I haven't bought ,  I bought once with a ,  a vitamin
some vitamins ? 
yes
you like the health thing a lot
ah ,  sometimes I think ,  sometimes I think in health things because nowadays ,  not only do you have to be buying health things but that not only of the food ,  understand ? 
aha
you have to ,  get in something ,  a supplement with the food not just the food ,  so I think sometimes in getting something else because sometimes
I don't eat like I should eat ,  you understand me ?  I'm sometimes eating fast in the street and I'm eating this and the other
okay
and not only that because ah when one is from Latin America he of Latin last name thinks that they eat well but they don't eat well because
I think the truth is like that because the ,  the food from Latin American is very greasy ,  with a lot of fat and all that
of course it depends who cooks ,  yes
yes and it depends what you are eating right ,  but the thing is that one thinks that
but in general ,  yes ,  we use a lot of oil
a lot of oil and they think that ,  I talk with the ,  here in New York we have a lot of Dominicans and Puerto Ricans ,  there's the food ,  they think and think that they are eating better that the United States
the propaganda of Latin America is very strong ,  you understand me ? 
yes ,  I find that in that case the difference is that there is in ,  in Latin American generally one walks a lot ,  well in New York I imagine you take the sub
yes
the subway
aha . 
I don't know ,  in Latin American you take the bus ,  all those buses everywhere and almost ,  not many people ,  well there are people with cars obviously but
is more common walking and taking the
aha
the buses and things
well but
like it helps camouflage that ,  that fat like you lose weight walking ,  but when one is here and keeps eating the same and plus on top of that you go in car
well ,  the thing is that where you live in Georgia perhaps they use cars a lot and California the same ,  in California you go everywhere in car
yes
because the people you don't know ,  the people from New York walk more than many people that ,  that
yes is that you are in the city itself
in the city itself ,  exactly so you walk
yes that city is very crazy
is still very hard having a car
yes
the car you move the car it cost you two three hundred dollars a month to park the car
sure
you understand me ? 
and it's really full of cars
yes no ,  we use public transportation ,  you know ? 
and it's good because they have ,  the bus passes here every hour so ,  what you do ,  if you miss it then you have to wait an hour stuck there
yes ,  we walk a lot in the city ,  I was reading a report on this and
in what part of New York are you in ? 
I'm in the city itself ,  Manhattan
in Manhattan
New York ,  New York man ,  the city of man ,  New York consists of five boroughs and they're called boroughs ,  ok ,  there are five
five ,  what ? 
five ,  they say ,  I don't know how you say it in Spanish ,  five blocks ,  no not blocks but five ,  ah
neighborhoods ,  neighborhoods
no ,  it's bigger than a neighborhood ,  much bigger than a neighborhood ,  the city of New York consists of five boroughs ,  no ,  I'm always looking for the word for boroughs but I can never find it
there are five boroughs in New York city
ah yes ,  Manhattan ,  Queens , 
exactly ,  Manhattan ,  Queens
what else ? 
ah ,  Staten Island ,  Manhattan ,  Queens ,  and the Bronx
the Bronx ,  I know
there are many
Brooklyn ,  Queens ,  Manhattan
do you know ,  Brooklyn ,  Queens and Manhattan
and the island ,  that is more
Staten Island that is State ,  Island
like I don´t know I know it ,  no maybe we did went there
a a a that part too the Bronx the Bronx there is much
yes the Bronx I think that I did not go to visit we
yeah ,  yeah because the Bronx there are many Puerto Ricans
yeah
in Manhattan in the upper part of Manhattan in the north of Manhattan there are many Dominicans
yeah
see and even when I am here ,  the ,  the Puerto Ricans speak Spanish very bad
very fast I imagine
Oh my God no ,  not only fast ,  the thing is that we wll you know have some words slang that belong to a country ,  a region ,  in your country there are some regions where people talk different do you understand me ? 
aha
but there is a base there where you can understand the Puerto Ricans ,  they a a problem with the r they have a problem with the r
the Puerto Ricans pronounce it different
"pelo" instead of "pero"
like a ,  more like an L
you know ,  when I say "pelo"
hmm
but the ,  the hair is what they have in the hair
yes they pronounce it different
and the dog is what runs ,  is an animal they ,  they ,  have problems with the  r itself ,  all the words that have  r they have problems with that
the ones from other countries that I've know and was hard to understand at first was El Salvador
aha
it was also hard
okay
understanding the Salvadorans
but ,  I can understand many other countries ,  I can understand them very well ,  but the truth that I see the Puerto Ricans that there are so many words ,  how are you going to have problems with the  r
the  r ,  then there are many words that you can't pronounce ,  you understand me ? 
yes
I'm going to tell you that
and you Where are you from ?  from Panama ,  right ? 
ah yes is Panama ,  yes
yes
Panama ,  a small country ,  understand ? 
yes
three million but is very developed ,  because the Panama commerce is very big but ,  the Panama Canal in all parts of the world ,  you understand me ? 
and there ,  is very commercial there
yes I can imagine ,  I have ,  I have a friend who is from Panama
yes ,  yes ,  it's developed for a small country ,  you know what I mean ?  and there ,  there ,  they've always had ,  Panama's currency has always been the United States' currency
dollars ,  that's Panama's currency
they have so much commerce
ah
they have so much commerce
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  we use the dollar ,  the American dollar ,  right ?  it's just that when you have money in your country ,  it's money from the United States
um ,  yeah
and there's a lot ,  there was a time when we had more than a hundred banks ,  for a small country that has nothing because ,  the commerce ,  do you know what I mean ,  from all over the world
and what's Panama like ?  it has three million
people
yes ,  but ,  how many millions does the biggest city have ? 
the biggest city is Panama ,  Panama City
I see
that's Pana ,  that's the capital as well
and how many people does it have
no ,  I don't how many exactly ,  I can't tell you how many people ,  because it's changed so much ,  I left Panama more than 30 years ago
the situation has changed a lot there ,  there are more people living away from the capital
I see
you know what I mean ,  Panama city expanded ,  it's like Mexico ,  Mexico city
yeah
understand ? 
yes well
well consider it
but Mexico ,  the city of Mexico has millions
exactly ,  it was ,  it was ,  no at one time it was the most populated city in the world
bigger what Mexico
Mexico city ,  yes
yes
yes ,  it was the most populated in the world ,  because you have the capital you have the country of Mexico right ? 
yes yes is huge
in Mexico city you know what I mean
yes
understand me ?  while in other countries ,  the United States ,  there's no capital like that in the United States there's no capital of the United States ,  the capital of the United States is Washington ,  DC understand ? 
yes ,  but it's a political capital ,  more than anything
yes ,  politically ,  only for ,  Mexico ,  the capital of Mexico
is not for the number of residents
yes ,  of residents at one time it had more people than New York many ,  many people didn't know that and still still like that the city of ,  of Mexico ,  capital of Mexico had more people that all ,  all the world
but ah that was before ,  I've always liked a man named Puentes he was one of Mexico philosophy and things like that he ,  he wrote many books and things
aha
he had a bridge ,  a good vision ,  how do you say it ,  he could say things that many Latins didn't like to hear
yes
so
good political eyesight or something
he wrote about political and situations in general
I see
in general ,  you know what I mean ?  he writes about many things in general and when he writes he makes you think a lot
What's his forename ? 
Puentes ,  I can't remember the forename ,  I don't know ,  no ,  Puentes
I see ,  the surname
political ,  how is it ?  political active ,  philosopher ,  he writes about a lot of things
I see ,  philosophy
and everything ,  you would like to talk to him
I see
Well ,  good night .  Carmen
good night okay what do you want ? 
I am Jenny
I talked to you yesterday ,  or the day before yesterday . 
yes it is in Nebraska
okay How are you ? 
yes ,  I´m fine
okay today´s episode is about
telemarketing and spam
okay ,  okay ,  you start however you want
yes ,  I don't like when people calls by phone trying to sell things
okay
because they always speak in a time that should not call
okay ,  specially when people are eating and  things like that
yes
okay
okay ,  they don´t take a no as an answer
okay
they are always working trying to sell things
okay ,  okay . 
and sometimes it's not even the truth
aha ,  aha
mhm and you know ,  it bothers me that when you look at your email
aha
it's full of trash ,  of spam I don't even read them I just take a look and the email has this folder
aha
it's called bookmail and you can just delete it ,  I don't even look at it
aha ,  well ,  I'm going to tell you something ,  look
aha ,  aha
I get lots of telephone calls because there are some companies that have five cents per minute ,  right ?  long distance since I use the phone
to call long distance
aha ,  aha
well ,  I call my mom to Puerto Rico everyday . 
aha
so ,  they call me and say they charge five cents per minute and I don't listen to them
aha
and then they keep on calling me they want to speak with the person who owns the phone ,  it's me but I always tell them that
yes
the person is not here ,  he's not here ,  so they ask me at what time is he getting home and I say ,  at nine PM ,  so that they stop bothering me
aha ,  oh aha
and yeah after nine at night they don't call me but the other day they started all day long they called me and the machine answers when I see the caller ID
aha ,  oh
that it's long distance ,  MCI I tell them no ,  and I won't pick up the phone
aha
but every now and then they come and call me ,  well sometimes I get up to fifteen ,  sixteen calls a day
aye God
but I don't answer because ah ,  I'm already tired of them and
aha
ah and always when I go to work and when I come home the machine is full of messages ,  the caller ID is full of numbers
aha
and what I do is I hear the messages
aha
and the ones that aren't important I erase
aha
but those that interest me ,  yes ,  I take down the number and I call who I have to call
aha
but ah also the telephone company like two years ago ,  the telephone company ,  I was in Puerto Rico
aha
and my daughter stayed there ,  with my son living in my apartment
aha
and the telephone company called my house here
aha
but I told my kids don't get the phone when it's the telephone company don't get it at all
ah
because they start to sell that if they have phone with camera ,  that if they have phone with answering machine with caller id
aha
that if they have cordless phone cheap and all ,  I tell my kids don't get the phone for nothing
aha
that it's from the telephone company since they call here I don't know how they changed my telephone number without me giving them permission
really ? 
that supposedly when you are you are responsible for your own phone
aha
you are the one that gives the authorization for them to change the number
aha ,  ah
and they changed it without me giving well I didn't ,  I was in Puerto Rico
aha . 
and my kids never answered the phone
aha
then ah
ah
I don't know how they do telemarketing I receive every four five days but I never answer either
mhm you know that with the MCI you just
aha
you have to tell them to erase your name from the computer and they don't dial you up again
so that they don't bother you ohhh
aha you ask them to erase your name from the computer
aha ,  aha
and like that they don't dial you again
oh so in the mail I receive many applications
mhm oh me too
from yes credit cards if I want to apply for a credit card
aha
subscriptions for magazines the what I do is that I tear up everything
aha
I throw it in the the ah in the garbage because I don't dare leaving a paper
ah
I mean I shred it
aha
and I throw it in the garbage can because I'm afraid of tearing it only once and throwing it in the garbage can
aha
and that someone ah since that has so much personal information
it
someone gets it and steals my identity
yes
then the spam doesn't worry me because I don't use the computer ,  I hardly ever use the computer
oh aha
but my daughter yes ,  my daughter uses the computer a lot and she says ,  and she says that when ah it has a lot ah they send a lot of spam
aha
and well she receives like fifty spam email
oh aha
and she what she does is that she erases all the ones that don't interest her
aha
sometimes ah the the ,  they sell her a lot of things through the email and she all that interest her she buys but hardly ever
aha
because what they sell is garbage
yes
then ah they also send me in the mail many letters of insurance
yes me too
of life that since I already turned fifty that I already have to get a life insurance so that my loved ones don't stay ah
bankrupt when I die ,  many things
Yes
I also get lots of letters from banks to become a member
right
and .  .  .  but i don't listen to them ,  what i do is i read them ,  i tear them and i throw them into the trash can
Uh huh
because if you listen to all of those letters ,  you'll end up bankrupt and you'll start sending
yes
finding everything they advertise
Yes ,  that's how it is ¿right ?  ,  i even put my name on that list
So ,  right
that i don't get telemarketing calls
Right
and they're still calling me
ok ,  because a girl ,  i stalked to a girl yesterday about this very thing
Right
she lives in Philadelphia and she told me that [if] i call a number and i call a place
right
and tell them not to send me any more letters ,  that I'm not interested about insurance or credit cards or anything
right
and all ,  and they get me off the list
oh aha
to do not send me because sometimes the mailbox ,  I have a mailbox
aha
and I have to go everyday the the seven ,  the six days of the week I have to go for my letters
aha ,  aha
because it gets so full so and so much that if someone send me a package they cannot put it inside the mailbox I have to pick it up inside the mail office
yes ,  yes
and that is a waste of time too too here at home I have a big mailbox
aha , 
and they put inside it garbage ,  a lot a lot a lot of garbage of of papers and today I receive one from from globe insurance I don´t know where that is
oh I also received that today aha
and I said why do that people send me this if
aha
what for am I going to take a life insurance if you pay more for life insurance than they are going to give ,  what
what they are going to give you
yes
then ah I told my daughter not now every time as the owner of the house put a big garbage collector
aha
every time I receive letters that I am not interested in I break them and throw in the garbage
do you know what my grandmother´s husband does
aha ,  aha
when they send things ,  he always puts an envelope inside the card
aha
he puts all their papers
aha
And back the envelope ,  they send it back
they break it and you send it back to them
yes
and they send it back again ah ah
ah
they send the paper back again or what ? 
I don't know if the company sends back another ,  but he always breaks the cards
aha
and you put it in their envelope and they send it back in the mail
ohhhhhhhhhhh interesting
always ah
so it doesn't continue because it's a lot
yes
and they bother you on the telephone too ,  they bother you ,  they send cards ah ,  in the mail
aha
because the mailbox fills up a lot a lot a lot
yes always what gets me a lot is someone calling to ah ,  sell children's books
oh like like the it's that one that comes
yes
and encyclopaedias and all yes yes
aha
yes before the used to call me not any more thanks God
yes
because now my children are grown ups
yeah they always tell me that
aha ,  aha ,  aha
and now they don't call me from from the phone companies yes AT and T and MCI called me a lot
aha
but now now I told them that well that that
aha
I erased my name and I told them that I have Spring and I am happy with them
aha ,  aha ,  aha
with them and now now they don't bother me with that
well the other time about two weeks ago someone called me and as I was working the left the phone number in the caller ID
aha
I come and say I don´t know this telephone ,  I don´t know the number ,  I called back and it was a telephone company
Oh my God
and tells me thank you for calling but see right now I came from work I am sorry but I cannot talk to you because I am tired and want to eat
call me later ,  later was ten at night I know they are not going to call me nothing more
aha
but when ah they call me I will recognize the number I will not
aha
answer but when they call me and I do not recognize the number in the box
aha ,  aha
I call them back but when there are those the companies selling you a thing selling you another one that if changing you to another long distance company
aha
I tell them I am sorry I cannot talk to you now I don´t have the time call me in one or two hours
aha
and if one hour or two if they call me I have the number in the box I know is the same person who
is calling me but it bothers very much much much much
aha yes short time ago they called me telling that ah a company was going to give me back some money I spent on things like people that sell things on the phone
aha
and needed the number of my bank account to deposit money
oh
and I told him that I don´t have a bank account and told me that
aha
if I had an account there in the same town where I live
aha
I told him I don't I told him sorry but I don't have an account

yes ,  yes . 
and we will pay everything ,  and then ,  it was not cheap ,  right ? 
Uh huh . 
And then you get these marvelous pictures . 
uh huh
the hotel ,  and how was this ,  and the restaurants . 
mm . 
and when they arrived there it was crap
ah . 
That everything was dirty or the beds broken ,  the doors are ,  eh ,  everything moldy ,  so that like you can't even touch things
Um
dirty ,  the sheets ,  well ,  they had to ,  they had to rent somewhere else and they left somewhere else ,  ¿right ? 
Oh
it was ,  they lost what they had payed for
Um
but the pictures were wonderful and
yes ,  yes ,  yes
and what they offered then ,  they said they spent twice as much because they had to
yes
to ,  of course they weren't staying in that filthy place
No ,  no ,  of course not ,  oh
and i say ,  oh my god ,  because they have sent me a lot of ,  from ,  they say Meat Cross Valcruz ,  ¿right ? 
yes ,  yes ,  but those are more serious
And ,  yes ,  but she tells me ,  reed ,  reed way down ,  it says it's not connected to the carnival company
Oh ,  they use the name
the use the name
Oh
And they're impostors ,  ¿right ?  ,  so
Uh huh
And you think they are that
Uh huh
And he went to buy that and then
Sure ,  sure ,  yes
these people that paid to Mexico ,  uh ,  they payed by check
Uh huh
And ,  well ,  the check was cashed by a person that doesn't exist ,  bogus name
Uh huh
With fake id's ,  so they could never ask for a devolution like it happened to me with the computer
yes ,  yes ,  yes
it's terrible
What a sin ,  for people so evil to exist ,  that want to steal people's money ,  ¿right ? 
I think so ,  i say I'm so scared about so many things that you no longer know who to trust ,  ¿right ? 
yes ,  i really ,  for example ,  offers or things that show up in ,  uh ,  Hispanic things ,  i wouldn't trust anything
Right ,  it's seems untrue ,  it's too bad ,  really ,  that
That ,  yeah ,  right
that you have to say that
Yes ,  exactly yes
thing
but it's just that American things are more serious
Sure ,  with ,  sure ,  and the signature ,  ¿right ?  ,  oh
yes . 
he name of the thing that you're buying ,  and like a site where you can ,  eh have a customer service to call ,  like where you can complain and everything
Sure ,  hmm ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
but if those who are there are the same who sell and are the same who charge and are the sa 
yes
what are you going to do ? 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
Aye God ,  and what do you think about Cuba and Venezuela ?   With this Chavez guy ,  aye , 
Aye . 
It's a tragedy ,  here we're really sad . 
And ,  and I don't know how they certified this election of this Carter who was
Hmm . 
and said that the election was legitimate
Because this ,  aye ,  I remember ,  I was remembering today that ah ,  they duplicated the identification of the ID
Hmm . 
They went out on
Hmm . 
on the internet ,  they send me an advisory but this is ,  that the voting there is very rare ,  for example ,  out of ten million people a million will go
and vote ,  and that's all there is ,  no ? 
Aha . 
sorry ,  it's that ,  they should say no ,  there's no election or something because no  no one came
All the same ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
and it's what happened that those who go are so few
Ah ,  aha . 
that they say ,  well ,  I won because I ended up with so many votes but
yes . 
it's that people abstained and so this is what's happening
And why did they abstain ? 
the first time  because since they were all ,  desperate to get out of the regime that no one voted but I don't know ,  I imagine that for ,  well obviously this man stayed
Ah . 
and everyone believed in him ,  no ? 
Aha . 
so some people voted ,  thirty percent ,  I think ,  of the voting population
This is really little ,  around here
aha . 
because here in the United States ,  eh ,  few people vote but they vote about fifty percent ,  something like that I think
Ah ,  something like that ,  this has to be because
yes . 
they have to count the votes that weren't powerful ,  right ? 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
Then that was the first time ,  later everybody already said ,  no we'll never do this again ,  let's vote even if it's against the other person ,  but
Sure . 
after they've done it ,  then already this ,  this ,  has so much force that they cancel uh ,  well ,  they do the ,  the impossible so that you can't see the ,  the opposite but rather the
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes .  What a sin . 
And that is the part that ,  yes ,  already the people won't be able to do more
And I regret that in the United States they are not concerned about that ,  nor do they give any publicity to what's happening in Venezuela . 
Mm .  yes ,  they know that is bad and they sometimes put it on the news but they don't put that many things that have happened of dead people and of
well ,  how the tyranny how it is ,  right ? 
Like that . 
that one doesn't even know because they don't even publish it that one ,  one finds out through their family and through other people
Sure ,  yes . 
but they are already terrified of talking on the phone ,  now it got really bad . 
No ,  I feel very bad for Venezuela because ,  with seeing that ,  that Chavez eh is such a lover of Fidel Castro ,  one ,  one already understands what type of regime he wants to impose
Ah .  And today that they said ,  my dad told me here in the television that Venezuela was Venezuela and Brazil ,  the two worst countries that ,  that have not contributed anything in Latin America . 
Ah . 
Then I don't know ,  because he's full of himself that ah ,  that Venezuela is the model ,  because since is there
yes . 
with Cuba
Mm ,  mm
but ,  and instead they came out that they don't do anything for anybody . 
And the bad luck that ,  with ,  with the increase in oil prices all the extra money that fell to this man now
This is bad ,  right ? 
yes .   And who knows if he will use it to make each ,  ah ,  evil against
Damage ,  hmm . 
and to do damage ,  yes . 
He says that ,  what ,  from here they wanted to do a ,  a ,  how do you say ?  an ambush and kill him ,  well ,  there there are many people who want
How good ,  right ? 
them to leave after they sent him to the other side
yes ,  hmm . 
but ,  I don't know and so  who knows ?  he says that this is very certain ,  but here it's not planned and there there's a lot
eh ,  of soldiers and near Venezuela and on the island in front ,  no ?   and there are ships ,  and there's this ,  there are airplanes
but who knows if it's true or made up ,  because he's such a liar
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
that you don't know what he says
yes ,  yes . 
you can't believe it ,  but what a pity ,  hopefully this will have another ,  another life ,  no ? 
Aye ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
another way of getting out of this
But they're such liars ,  I was watching an interview last night where an American man who had ,  he ,  had passed a year in Cuba was saying ,  aye ,  everything in Cuba's good ,  only that
oh
eh ,  they are materially backwards
Mm . 
due to the American embargo . 
Those are people that don't even know what they are saying ,  I think .  Because they are not living in the ,  the toughness of that ,  right ? 
they go and look and say ah ,  they are
Bessy
Oh ,  Tammy ,  how are you ? 
What's up ?  Look ,  I was thinking ,  oh ,  when will I talk to Tammy ? 
Oh ,  it's just that every day at six o'clock I have been running ,  and I just forgot my number to log in ,  and my computer is giving mew some problems ,  so the other day I just decided to remember the number
aha
And so ,  how are you ? 
Fine ,  and you ?  how was your weekend ?  I know we are not supposed to talk about weekend ,  but ,  oh well
No ,  I went on hikinf this weekend
Aha ,  oh

Oh ,  I see .  And
My bones still hurt .  Inventing
I can see from here ,  the ,  yeah
From there ?  yes ,  when I was up there ,  some people from Canada
Really ? 
Up there ,  I got to
Aha
I said ,  let's walk seven miles forward and seven miles back ,  but no way ,  I walked four miles because it was so plain and wide
almost two feet wide
Mhm
and after I went down there .   And it was earth ,  and rocks ,  and water ,  and ,  and I wasn't used to this .   So ,  i said ,  no ,  man ,  Mr , 
Ah .   Aye ,  how terrible . 
Hey ,  so ,  no one from telemarketing has called you lately ? 
Ah ,  I want to see .   Ah ,  no ,  no no one .   And you ?   Really ? 
Aha ,  because my son laughs when they call me ,  I say ,  because it was ,  it was part of refinancing the house , 
Aha . 
and so ,  since they're always calling me ,  I say no ,  the woman rents the house ,  she's not here .   He watches me and says ,  who are you talking too ? 
And I say ,  I'm tired of and I say no ,  and yeah . 
Aha . 
They haven't called me ,  today .   But ,  but what makes me smile ,  my husband ,  is crazy . 
Ah .   Yeah ,  it's really annoying .   But I ,  I worked in this before . 
Ah ,  you also did this ? 
yes ,  but ,  be before .   Of ,  of selling . 
yes . 
But this ,  this was bad because they always hung up the phone .   And ,  the sound ,  how it ,  it hurt . 
yes ,  I couldn't do this kind of job .   I can't ,  I say to my husband ,  you can't make me sell anything ,  because I don't like selling things to people ,  trying to sell people things . 
Ah .   No ,  me neither . 
I can't . 
Sell . 
Eh ,  because ,  I was ,  I was looking ,  and my husband started to laugh .   That no ,  the sales ,  no ,  no nothing in sales . 
And he works in sales ? 
No , and ,  my husband works in ,  eh ,  computers . 
Ah ,  mm . 
so ,  that's what he ,  he's trying to help me find a job .  But ,  and now no ,  Are you washing dishes ? 
No ,  I'm just washing my hands . 
Well ,  it seems as if you were moving and the pots there outside
No ,  I'm in the kitchen . 
Ah ,  he just called me because I have a headache that is killing me .  And ,  he tells me ,  Are you going to cook today ,  or you want to cook today ?  And I say no . 
He says ,  okay ,  I'll bring food ,  I say ,  thank God . 
Ah ,  thank you ,  how nice . 
yes ,  and he ask me What do you want ?  And I Say ,  bring me anything ,  because I can't think about what to eat right now with this headache . 
No ,  no .  you want to cook ?  Ah ,  no ,  well ,  that doesn't bother you ,  if they tell you ,  you want to cook ?  No ,  no ,  I don't want to cook .  But ,  What do you want to eat ?  Ah ,  whatever ,  it doesn't matter . 
Try it   surprise I tell mine . 
Aha . 
Okay ,  but later ,  Ah ? 
yes ,  my husband is the cook .  My husband is the cook . 
Ah ,  what a gentleman ,  not mine . 
I cook every now and then ,  he cooks more than me . 
Really ? 
He likes to cook ,  he's an inventor ,  I don't cook for Thanksgiving nor Christmas ,  because I don't know how to make the turkey . 
You ,  you don't know to cook turkey ? 
No ,  my brother taught my husband how to cook turkey ,  it makes me laugh ,  so ,  he's the one who cooks the turkey . 
Really ? 
And ,  he's calm ,  he doesn't say to me ,  aye ,  this year ,  he says ,  no ,  what size am I going to buy ?   and the inventions that he does with this turkey ,  and in the end ,  he knows well . 
Aha . 
I say ,  thank god that I have a man like that . 
Hmm . 
Aye , 
Aha . 
But ,  ah ,  yes .   These people ,  here ,  I think that they sent it to me today in my
The work . 
e mail . 
Aha . 
I had ninety six messages .   Ninety six messages .   out of these ninety six messages ,  only twelve were from people who I knew . 
Two ,  that's it . 
Twelve , 
Ah ,  twelve , 
and the rest were trash . 
Telemarketing
I say ,  aye ,  my god ,  and my husband says ,  man ,  you get all these things that come out there ?   And I say ,  I say ,  I say ,  this is why , 
You will see .  Is that ,  when you get on the internet and they ask you for the email . 
Mm
you give it and they send you a bunch of , 
Mm ,  and they give it to other people ,  and those people to other people ,  and they finish .  So , 
yeah ,  is true . 
I told him that I have to get again to put ,  here to my filter ,  more
And ,  I also have filters in the computer ,  but they always send you things in the email . 
hard . 
I hate that .  Well ,  yes .  Ah ? 
And ,  sometimes ,  when I ,  I do a lot of surveys on the computer .  So ,  that's also what happens to me . 
What do you do ? 
Surveys like this one ,  but on the computer .  Or sometimes ,  my son does it . 
Ah ,  okay ,  me too .  Aha . 
That ,  so , 
They pay me for the survey
mm ,  me too . 
Some ,  not all . 
yes ,  my husband laughs because ,  eh ,  they send me the money in PayPal . 
Ah ,  me too ,  I still have it in the PayPal ,  no ,  no ,  I haven't
and since I don't ,  My husb 
I haven't cashed it . 
my husband is the one who ,  he takes it form there ,  like giving me a bill ,  and I laughed ,  because he said it was for services given ,  and I say ,  what services did you give me for me to pay you ? 
So ,  he started laughing because he ,  so ,  because I didn't put my credit card .   So ,  he , 
Aha . 
he took it out ,  he gave me a bill ,  I say ok ,  pay him . 
Ah ,  aha .   Have you ever bought something on the internet ? 
yes ,  I bought ,  I bought on Amazon ,  or Sam Goody ,  or , 
Ah ,  aha .   I've bought one or two times .   But ,  there ,  yeah ,  no . 
yes ,  I like to buy things ,  the majority ,  some of the surveys that I do ,  pay me with with Amazon . 
Oh ,  aha . 
Certificates .   So ,  now I have like ninety eight dollars ,  I told my husband ,  okay ,  someone will get something free for Christmas .   I say ,  less money for me ,  to spend .   So , 
and ,  you're going to have the ,  the laser eye surgery . 
aye ,  yes .   No ,  not this Christmas .   I have to have a surgery the other month . 
The other month ? 
Aha . 
Oh ,  so it's really flirty . 
No ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  this is the other surgery ,  that they told me ,  I have to put ,  I go to , 
O 
I'm looking for work ,  and now I can't look for work because they told me that I have to stay in bed for two weeks , 
Aha . 
And two weeks later ,  i have to take it softly
Oh
I tell my husband ,  ¿what job is gonna give me a month off when I'm just starting ? 
Right ,  and ,  ¿what's that ,  that surgery about ? 
Oh ,  i got some bumps ,  near the ovaries
Right ,  o well ,  and ,  ¿what's it's name ? 
So ,  uh huh ,  i had a ,  four ,  uh ,  four ,  i mean ,  six years ago
¿You see ?  ,  uh huh
and when i went to the doctor ,  he said i had six now
Oh
then my husband says "lets go ,  do that now"
¿Dangerous ? 
¿Huh ? 
Are they dangerous
No
Dangerous ,  ¿right ? 
That ,  he says it they aren't ,  that's what he ,  that's what gives me trouble when that time of the month comes
Right
Plenty of blood comes out
Oh
yes ,  that ,  and it bothers me a lot .   So ,  this is why
E 
I use too many tampons a month .   So ,  they told me ,  the doctor tells me ,  use use them too much ,  he says .   And the pain ,  I say well ,  I deal with it ,  because I don't like to take medicine . 
He says ,  you're crazy ,  woman . 
And it hurts you ? 
Aha .   It hurts me a lot so ,  he says that it's this .   So , 
Oh .   Because this happened to me to but well ,  it's called endometrosis and yeah ,  it happened a lot ,  they're like grapes ,  the doctor says , 
in the fallopian tubes ,  and in the ovaries . 
yes ,  and I don't have tubes ,  yeah ,  they'll pay us for this call ,  right ?   They're going to pay us both for this call . 
Yes ,  I still have it .   Ah ,  sorry ?   No ,  yeah ,  well ,  yes ,  telemarketing is really annoying .   Yeah ,  they'll pay us for this ,  certainly . 
They must
Aye
to ,  talk about what we want for ten minutes . 
Aha .   No one ,  so ,  what I should do is get your email and send you an email so we can talk there .   Because ,  I like you . 
Ah ,  yeah . 
Huh ? 
I also like you .   Talking ,  like five times ,  with this . 
yes ,  we keep talking ,  yesterday I talked with a guy who does salsa
And what did he tell you ? 
And I talked with him twice .   And ,  ah ,  he's called Alex . 
And he started to cry .   Ah ,  Alex . 
So ,  you ,  yes ,  so if you take the call ,  like this one at nine and night ,  you'll call Alex . 
Oh ,  no ,  that's very late . 
Because , 
No .   What ,  what time is it there in Seattle ? 
Here it's six . 
Here it's also six .

He's in California ? 
Aha . 
No ,  I will never take a call at nine at night . 
yes ,  yes my , 
Very late , 
yes ,  they call me from six until ten . 
From ,  until ten ? 
Hmm .   Since I'm always awake until really late ,  so ,  I told them that they can call me until , 
oh ,  aha ,  my husband gets mad sometimes ,  when they're calling and calling .   And if you don't take it right then ,  will they talk to you until midnight ?   I say no ,  no ,  no .

Oh no ,  so ,  ¿you ,  you ? 
Before we run out of the ten minutes
Yes ,  ¿did you put yourself there ?  ,  ¿where you the one who told me that you put yourself on ,  uh ? 
Oh ,  ¿where ? 
Or it wasn't you ?  ,  the list so they won't call you
¿Which list ? 
The ,  uh ,  these people that calls you to sell you stuff
Oh ,  no ,  i ,  i haven't signed to any ,  any list
no ,  oh
I didn't know there was a list
I think only here in the United States .  It's just ,  it's a list where you can get in ,  and they don't ,  they don't call you anymore
Right
But ,  i don't know where you start to find this alleged list
No ,  maybe ,  uh ,  call ,  call the phone company ,  ¿what is it ? 
The telephone maybe
Right ,  maybe they know
Right ,  ok ,  yeah i have heard that yeah ,  you give your name ,  your name and your phone and they don't send
Hello
Hello
yes
Good evening
Uh ,  my name is Annie ,  ¿what's your name ? 
Oh ,  my name is Jose ,  ¿and you ? 
Annie
Annie
Yes
Oh ,  nice to meet you
¿Where are you calling from ? 
Uh ,  from Philadelphia
Oh ,  i believe i have spoken to you previously
Oh ,  yeah ,  ¿where do you live ? 
Miami
Um ,  possibly ,  yeah ,  i don't know
You're from Spain ,  ¿right ? 
No ,  no ,  I'm from ,  well ,  half Guatemalan and half Cuban
Oh ,  well then it wasn't you ,  I'm sorry
No ,  no ,  no ,  i don't think so ,  yeah ,  ¿what do you think about telemarketing ? 
Ah ,  I don't like it . 
I think that no one likes it .   With everyone I've talked to ,  no one likes it .   No ,  but ,  yes ,  it's bothersome ,  right . 
Yes ,  I've never understood the reason for this .   Why do people call ?   But
yes
apparently ,  you know ,  they make money because if not ,  they wouldn't do it ,  you know ,  call so much . 
yes ,  yes .   I don't know ,  and luckily I have a cell phone and I don't give my number to any companies and ,  this is why no one calls me ,  but I'm lucky , 
eh ,  for example in the residential houses ,  where ,  I imagine they get the numbers out of the phone books , 
yes
always ,  they're always calling and calling ,  I know that in the case of my mom ,  she had ,  yeah ,  almost every day someone called selling something . 
And one day she called the telephone company and they said that ,  there was a service and with this service ,  if the person called a number that wasn't identified ,  if it wasn't identified . 
so ,  a recording came out saying that they didn't ,  well accept numbers ,  calls from ,  from the number ,  where the person hadn't identified themselves ,  only if they , 
yes
say your name .   So the company records the name and then they call you ,  and ask if you want to accept the call . 
yes
but the problem is that ,  this requires a human to be on the other line ,  but the thing is ,  the majority of these calls , 
are done by computers , 
yes
And so well this never happens calls ,  well ,  it's very rare to get a call from telemarketing . 
hmm
So it's fantastic ,  it's fantastic .   But it's really annoying . 
mm yes ,  we ,  oh
yes
We put it in the do not call list
mhm
And that did help a lot but the problem is that apparently ,  we had this phone oh ,  it was a phone number of course ,  that once belonged to somebody else ,  and they assigned it to us . 
mhm
And that person was not paying his bill ,  so a lot of times . 
aha , 
you know ,  we would get calls from people asking us if we knew that person ,  I don't even remember his name ,  and you know telling us that we had to pay this ,  and that ,  but I was like ,  you know ,  this
I don't know him ,  that people . 
yes
But and ,  they kept on calling me and I can't do anything about it and that's what bothers me most
And they probably didn't believe you ,  right ,  they would think ,  they don't want to pay and are just making up stories and
aha mhm
that's horrible
So ,  you know ,  I've called the phone company but ,  since it's usually a one eight hundred number
mhm
they can't block the calls . 
mm
so ,  you know ,  but I know that this is not telemarketing or spam but ,  it still bothers me
Well ,  yes ,  yes ,  it's worse ,  oh that's a shame ,  no ,  not once ,  we o
mhm
Well ,  the first cellphone that my family had was many years ago ,  it was like this big thing ,  that a person ,  a man called us and he left a message and it said something like
hey ,  I know that you have my  money ,  he said something like that ,  I don't want to go to your house and fight you but I'll have to do it if you don't send me my money ,  something like that ,  right . 
so ,  we never called him back ,  really ,  because it wasn't for us ,  we didn't know that person ,  we thought that someone had previously had that same number .  But , 
hey ,  you do sometimes get these calls ,  they are ,  they are I mean ,  destined to someone else . 
yes ,  yes
But ,  no ,  it also happened to us one time as we are ,  we used to live in Tennessee ,  so ,  oh , 
aha
Well ,  the truth is that I don't know ,  fifteen years ,  a long time ,  so ,  oh ,  not that much really ,  ten years ,  someone called ,  it was a man from Tennessee
So ,  he left a message in the phone ,  it was like , 
mhm
oh ,  oh ,  it was like ,  Joan I'm in the hospital and they never knew who Joan was or who the man was ,  nn ,  but sometimes we do get calls that
are kind of crazy ,  but
We have also received calls from an inmate . 
and ,  yes
he thinks we are his family and so they allow him to make a call ,  so ,  oh , 
oh
so ,  before you answer the call ,  the inmate has to ,  I think he has like fifteen or thirty seconds to say his name
mhm
and ,  and he was calling me and was telling me instead of saying his name ,  well ,  he said his name really quickly and then he said call me I need help . 
I ,  I don't know you ,  I'm not going to call you ,  you know . 
No ,  I don't know ,  yes
But , 
yes ,  this is a little more dangerous too . 
yes ,  yes , 
yes
But you know ,  to me ,  the telemarketers ,  I don't know how they make their money ,  because I don't know anyone ,  anyone who has bought something , 
You know ,  what they're selling . 
yes
Or what they're offering . 
yes
And ,  and even less the spam that they send you . 
Ah yes ,  yes but the problem is that ,  eh ,  it costs so little to send all this mail ,  if one person in a thousand responds ,  they'll earn enough money ,  right . 
yes ,  but also ,  not so much with telemarketing but with spam . 
yes
It's completely automatic because they ,  they have a computer ,  that goes on the internet and then looks for
hmm
ah ,  email addresses ,  so it makes a ,  it creates a list ,  so people buy it .   So this doesn't even take one second of human time ,  the computer does it ,  so they resell them so
yes
The person has the list already .  They make their message ,  they send it to the computer ,  and send it and send it .  It takes
no effort ,  almost no effort ,  really
mhm
Then ,  if ,  if a few people answer you earn
yes
But it is incredible ,  it is incredibly cheap ,  sending all that ,  because before ,  hundred years ago for instance ,  there were not such messages ,  right ?  but now everything is so cheap
Creating information ,  information and at least
yes
it is rubbish ,  a waste of time ,  because before ,  imagine when you had to write letters by hand ,  the only messages sent were important things ,  right ? 
yes
Nowadays ,  anything .  Sending costs nothing ,  right ? 
yes
No ,  I mean .  But we have never bought anything of spam or telemarketing
And sometimes when you tell them to stop ,  they send you more
yes
They send you more ,  because that's what they are waiting for ,  you know ,  having a valid address
mm
Of spam
Right ,  right
So ,  you know ,  I use hotmail ,  I use hotmail and as soon as I see it is spam I don't even open it
But I immediately send it to ,  to . 
mm
To the trash . 
mm ,  mm ,  yes ,  yes I and already everybody that I know have a ,  have an address that they give everybody on the internet . 
yes
to all the companies on the internet and there they get ,  yes thousands of spam messages every month ,  right . 
yes
but then they always have their private address . 
yes
But ,  and ,  and what I don't understand with hotmail is that for example I create an address that I didn't give anyone ,  anyone ,  an address that I created ,  and never used ,  but , 
there I returned a while later ,  and already ,  I had started receiving spam messages
mm
And I don't know from where ,  is that ,  in some way ,  I don't know with hotmail in some way .  They find the address of people . 
yes
And I don't know if maybe .  I don't know if is ,  eh ,  for example find name ,  for example last names ,  let's say ,  Smith Then they send a letter to ,  to , 
Smith ,  then to  a smith ,  then to  d smith ,  Because one knows that ,  probably there's someone that ,  that with ,  with the name ,  with the address of  d smith
I mean smith  d smith ,  things like that right . 
aha
Because there are so many people in hotmail that ,  that can pick messages randomly ,  like that ,  or emails randomly almost . 
aha
Is going to arrive ,  perhaps fifty percent of the emails arrive . 
yes
But I don't know how ,  but they already had the number ,  the address of ,  of this address that never already I don't know how they found it ,  I don't know . 
mm
But is terrible . 
yes and
And now , 
aha ,  it continues
and ,  and I say that now it has become harder .  um For the scammers in the United States and now there is more spamming that ,  that
that they send ,  even from outside of the United States .  Then for example there are people foreigners that send spam to the United States ,  then no , 
is very hard finding them . 
mm
But ,  ah ,  is terrible ,  and ,  but never now that ah ,  Microsoft wanted
aha
do well ,  it's been like a year two years that they've been talking of creating a technology ,  in which
aha
Each time ,  that one sends a message .  The computer has to ,  I don't know exactly what it is ,  but it has to do a certain process like that in the computer , 
oh is ,  almost like ,  I think that it is ,  finding a code , 
aha
but then ,  on the basis of ,  of being like that like no ,  no ,  I really don't know ,  but a bunch of mathematics combinations of ,  of ,  of ,  no ,  no I don't exactly understand right ,  but then , 
this process requires a certain amount of time ,  right ? 
aha
and then the thing is that when the computer does this process ,  the message has a ,  like a certificate that ,  that the computer made this process to send the message
So ,  the thing is that if the person ,  let's suppose it's you who writes it ,  you write an email ,  then you send it .  It is so short , this process ,  that you don't even notice ,  and you send it ,  and that's it ,  right ? 
mhm
But ,  if you are sending thousands of emails ,  the process is done while sending the thousands and thousands
Hello ? 
Hello ? 
Hello ,  how are you ? 
Fine ,  how are you ?   Fine ,  thanks ,  thanks . 
I'm Paulina ,  with whom am I speaking ? 
Ah ,  Vicente .   I'm Vicente and from ,  from ,  where are you from ,  Paulina ?

That's what I was thinking .   We talked yesterday . 
yes ,  and it was the same topic
Eh ,  was it yesterday or the day before ?   I talked with ,  with a Spanish woman too ,  I don't remember exactly . 
Ah ,  I don't know ,  I think that it was yesterday . 
And what an ,  eh ,  and
Ah ,  yes ,  you were talking about the
of
Carlos Fuentes . 
of telemarketing that you don't buy from many people when they call or something like that . 
yes ,  yesterday . 
yes ,  oh ,  boy
And ,  we finished the conversation with Carlos Fuentes that if you wanted to talk with someone ,  I don't know what ,  that didn't speak with Latins with someone cultured or I don't know what
Oh ,  yes ,  yes ,  eh ,  yes that you asked me about ,  about Fuente's first name
It was Carlos ,  right ?  Carlos Fuentes ? 
Ah ?  I don't remember the first name ,  but a ,  a library or bookstore and that they sell ah books in Spanish
yes . 
and then you tell them of Fuentes ,  eh from Mexico ,  perhaps they have the book of the author because he ,  he is ,  he is ,  he's intelligent ,  he says the
he says that the Latins speak with a lot of emotion
Ah ,  yes . 
instead of with the head . 
AH . 
Understand ? 
yes . 
They say things that you can't believe ,  eh ? 
yes ,  no ? 
yes ,  that ,  that he uses is when one when Latins come to the United States ,  eh and they forget how they lived before in their country . 
And and this is ten thousand times more advanced to what they had in their country . 
Ah ,  yes . 
yes ,  he says things like that ,  he ,  he ,  eh ,  he says no ,  he's crazy ,  eh
How old is Carlos Fuentes ,  more or less ? 
What ? 
How old would he be ? 
Me ,  me ? 
No ,  him ,  Carlos Fuen 
And ,  he ,  he has to be at least sixty ,  something ,  fifty ,  something like that . 
Ah ,  yes . 
yes ,  eh ,  I don't know ,  I don't know ,  I haven't heard much about him lately ,  you know but
He's a little old already . 
ah ,  yes ,  eh ,  old ,  yes ,  a little old
Aha . 
eh ,  is of ,  is of the eh ,  well ,  in Mexico the majority of the Mexicans are mixed race ,  with Indians ,  eh ? 
Aha . 
But the ones that are in power are more Europeans . 
yes in ,  in Chile too . 
Eh ,  With ,  eh ,  exactly ,  all Latin America . 
yes . 
and ,  and many of those who are in
Very racist . 
and many of those who are in power are Jewish too . 
yes ,  also . 
They're Jewish ,  they're ,  people think that the leaders are only American and European but there are Jews ,  eh ,  in Spain ,  who speak Spanish ,  you know ? 
No ,  yes ,  there are Jews everywhere
yes ,  yes ,  well everywhere ,  yes ,  in Spanish . 
In Chile there are also many Germans
German ,  ah ,  yes ? 
and many Italians . 
Argentina too . 
yes ,  Argentinians too . 
And ,  and the ,  eh ,  in Cuba ,  right ? 
yes . 
Those who had power ,  those who ,  who were controlling Cuba before Fidel was there ,  right ?   It was a cura  a Cuban ,  ah
Cubans ,  ah ,  who are Jewish
yes ,  I didn't know
that con ,  that controlled everything and ra  ,  the reset of the people didn't have anything .  Well ,  we have to t  ,  we have to talk about telemarketing and that ,  right ? 
yes , 
And h 
eh
Well ,  what I must say ,  the day before eh
It's ,  it's the same topic ,  no ? 
I to  ,  I you yes ,  yes it's the same topic ,  ah I ,  I ,  I to  ,  I told you that they have a list that the government has right ? 
that you could place your
Ah ,  did you get into the list already ? 
No ,  I yes  ,  I bu  ,  I ,  and when it came out last year ,  I think it came out ,  that the b  ,  the government was open ,  the list ,  and that you cou 
man  ,  you can call a ,  a ,  you call ,  right ?  a ,  a ,  a phone call of ,  of eight hundred ,  you know it's from the government ,  and you enter your phone number
And they don't bother you . 
and they can't call you to sell you things they can call you if you owe them chavo , 
If you what ? 
If you owe them money . 
Ah ,  yes . 
yes ,  but po  ,  to tell you that you come ah ,  that I want to sell you this or that I want you to come to this ,  ah ,  to this di  ,  that you buy this ,  they can't do that
Eh ,  and what did you say ?  if you owe them chavos ?  Is that way you said ? 
yes ,  you owe them money ,  they can call you ,  it's different . 
OK ,  no ,  to learn the ,  the
Po  ,  yes ,  yes ,  I did one
eh ,  'chavo' ,  aha ,  is that Panamas or where is it from ? 
No ,  a 'chavo' ,  'chavo' because 'chavo' means money ,  or 'plata' we say 'plata'
yes
'Plata' and money ,  pesos
No ,  how interesting ,  I  , I  ,  I would like to learn how they speak in other countries
In other countries
yes
yes ,  it is like ,  I was talking to an Ecuadorean ,  you know the banana ,  right ? 
yes
Ah ,  the ,  the one you fry and eat ,  the banana
yes
In Ecuador ,  in Ecuador they call them 'maduros'
'Maduros' ,  I see ,  we in Chile call 'platano' to the banana .  Bananas ,  how you call it ?  ,  the English banana
E  No ,  no ,  there are bananas and plantains ,  they are different
e  yes ,  no ,  I know they are different ,  but in Chile there are no plantains and bananas ,  there are just plantains
Do you call banana both of them ? 
We call them both plantains ,  to bananas
You call plantains the bananas ? 
yes ,  because there's only one ,  and we call it plantain .  I learned there were bananas when
Oh . 
I knew a friend from ,  from Ecuador and ,  when one leaves their country you learn many things also . 
Oh ,  yes ,  well yes because in Panama ,  we we called the plantains ,  plantains and we called the banana ,  banana or banana
Okay
ah , eh you call it bananas also or not ? 
No ,  we just called it bananas ,  because we only have that yellow one
Ah . 
that that they call here banana . 
Eh ,  that ,  eh ,  that Oh ,  eh ,  that is what
We don't have the little ones nor the bigger ones . 
that is that ,  like a fruit ,  the bananas are eaten ,  the bananas are eaten like a ,  like a fruit ,  while the eh
The plantains are eaten fried ,  yes . 
the plantains ,  are cooked .  You fry them or ,  they can be cooked green or something like that eh . 
Ah ,  yes ,  see ? 
That can be done too ,  to me ,  when ,  in Ecuador they call it ripe .  And how ripe ,  what is ripe ?  And ,  they showed me a banana ,  and I said ,  that's not a banana ,  eh ? 
But one learns a lot when ,  like you say ,  when one leaves their country .  Is the same that in ,  ah ,  here we have the ah
Puerto Ricans that call ,  ah well ,  you ,  can call it beans
yes
in Mexico they call them beans . 
In Chile we call it beans . 
Poroto so  ,  yes ,  in Panama they say porotos too ,  but porotos are a kind of bean . 
Ah ,  yes ? 
These are the red ones ,  right ?   The big red ones . 
Ah ,  no ,  for us porotos is like generic ,  yes . 
All ,  You all ,  you all say 
There's the red poroto ,  the white ones ,  they're ,  the sabas that are bigger ,  white . 
the  in Panama we call the the the red ,  the big red one poroto . 
Yeah . 
But there's habichuela
We have black porotos ,  white porotos ,  por 
oh ,  you call all this poroto ,  okay ,  because Cubans use the black ones
Sure . 
Cubans all with the ,  with the beans ,  the black habichuela is what they use ,  the Cubans use a lot and the Mexicans use pintos ,  they use pintos a lot
Yeah ,  yes . 
and here the ,  the Puerto Ricans use the pink one . 
yes . 
The habicheula or ,  they ,  they call it habichuela ,  no ,  in other countries they say beans ,  eh
Same as ,  well ,  the ,  ah ,  corn ,  I don't know what you say ,  we say choclo ,  for corn
yes ,  yes we call it corn . 
Corn you call it ,  yes ,  we say choclo . 
yes . 
It's called corn . 
Oh ,  yeah ? 
And the avocado ,  we call it avocado . 
Ah , 
Ah ,  yes and they are different things . 
Okay ,  but there are certain things that are ,  languages that are not appropriate ,  but when you are listening ,  eh ,  to some news they use ,  try to use words that are appropriate . 
Because they have to be more universal . 
For the countries more ,  eh
Understand ? 
in Central America ,  in Argentina ,  Chile ,  Uruguay we use more similar words ,  put on your corn is more of the Indians from the south of ,  of
Yeah that's Indian ,  corn is of the Indians ,  yes yes . 
Sure . 
Eh ,  eh ,  because in Panama we use more correct Spanish ,  which is possible because Panama is very universal ,  understand ?  There are ,  are many people from all parts of the world in Panama ,  there are ,  are ,  are , 
Cubans ,  there are Chileans ,  there are people from all ,  from all parts of Latin America come to ,  to Panama . 
yes ,  then we use a more general Spanish . 
yes , a ,  a ,  yes ,  exactly ,  the Spanish in Panama is more general eh ,  is more correct ,  what it says in the book ,  because they have to talk a ,  from different parts ,  understand ?  of the world . 
Mm , 
Because many people there go there by ships and work for a ship eh and ,  and when they want to leave their country they ,  how do you call it ?  jump ship
Aha . 
Jump ship ,  they leave the ship ,  hide in Panama and stay there for the rest of their life
Oh ,  really ? 
yes  , yes ,  there is immigration ,  after some time ,  they come and become Panamanian and when you are Panamanian it's easier ,  before was easier to come to the United States
Before ,  right ? 
yes ,  it was very easy to come to the United States ,  because remember ,  Panama is like a colony of the Unites States
They bought the Channel
You know hat I mean ?  yes ,  the channel and everything the channel means ,  eh ,  Panama is a creation of the United States
Mhm
You know what I mean ?  The currency in Panama was ,  eh ,  the currency in Pa  ,  eh ,  eh ,  is the United States's currency and it has always been ,  banks ,  eveything is from the United States
It's rather a colony ,  it's like a colony of the United States ,   they think they are an independent country ,  but they aren't independent ,  see ? 
They depend a lot on the United States
yes
And ,  Fuentes says it often ,  people there don't know it is better learning from the United States athn from your own country
because if the United States want to ,  they will cause you problems ,  if the United States want to ,  they can kill your government and so
That's right ,  the United States can kill any government ,  people there ,  in Latin America ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes and they have done it ,  yes
yes .  They have a great influence
A greta one ,  the ,  the dictators there used to be
yes ,  that's how they do their businesses ,  they
yes  , yes ,  very dirty affairs before ,  the United States say stop or leave ,  and they have to stop
because they rule ,  that's what Fuentes says ,  and people can't believe it ,  but he is right ,  in that
in that matter ,  eh ,  but we have to talk about telemarketing telemarketing there's telemarketing now that call you in Spanish also . 
yes . 
yes . 
yes ,  my sister worked once ,  like that ,  ah ,  they send the people
Aha ,  yes ,  I ,  I did that for a while too ,  for a short time ,  yes . 
Ah ,  really ?  what ,  what did you sell ? 
I ,  I work for Sprint
Oh . 
you know ,  Sprint the one of the cellular . 
Mm ,  of telephone . 
yes ,  and what did you and what ,  eh ,  but before ,  before there was of long distance ,  eh Now ,  ah ? 
Of long distance ,  yes .  Of long distance . 
yes ,  long distance ,  now ,  now we don't have to do that because now you have a cell phone a long distance is the same as ,  as if you are making a local call
If you have a cell phone
No . 
no ,  if you have a cell phone that's the nicest thing about the cell phone that if you are calling a person in Colorado ,  in California ,  right ? 
that is the same as making a call ,  a local call . 
Depending on the plan that you have ,  sure . 
Ah ? 
It depends on the plan that you have . 
Eh ,  of ,  all the plans ,  all the plans are the same ,  all the plans the distance now in the ,  in the United States no ,  it does not exist when you have a cell phone
Do you understand ?  it cost the same to call to California that calling a person that ,  that that ,  lives three ,  three blocks from you ,  from the place you live . 
Ah ,  yes ,  How long did you worked at Sprint ? 
Well Sprint ah ,  I worked for a short ,  I worked only for oh ,  around four or five months . 
Ah ,  yes . 
I had free time ,  and wanted to make some money but for a time ,  eh ,  poor little thing Do you understand ?  and I talked to people ,  from Sprint eh ,  Sprint distance
And how do they do the selling ?  They call ,  How do they get the names ? 
They have ,  have a list . 
yes ,  but
Sometimes ,  sometimes ,  sometimes you can ,  eh ,  make the list of names ,  sometimes they have a machine that gives you the names automatically .  And ,  eh ,  sometimes not ,  they have ,  sometimes they have a list
and a computer ,  right ?  when you sit down right ?  when you sit down you have to put a
Hi
Hello ,  yes
Hi ,  I'm Salma from Texas ,  well
Oh ,  that's good ,  because i was about to hang up
Oh ,  ¿yes ? 
It's the first time I'm making a call so i didn't know what to expect ,  ¿where are you from ? 
Right ,  uh ,  from Puerto Rico
Puerto Rico ,  that's good
Uh huh ,  uh huh ,  and you sound like you're from Argentina or Chile
from Chile ,  of course
You're Chilean
Yes ,  it shows ,  our tone rats us out .  And ,  ¿is it the first time you call too ? 
No ,  no ,  this is my fifth call
Oh ,  and ,  ¿could you tell me a little bit of what's this about ? 
Oh ,  well ,  uh ,  every day there's a different subject
Yeah
So ,  they basically give us twelve minutes to talk about that subject
oh ,  OK
And they're studying linguistics ,  so i believe they're comparing different accents like ,  how we speak ,  people from different parts of Latin America
Oh ,  perfect ,  oh ,  so we have to talk about the subject ,  ¿is it telemarketing ? 
mhm ,  okay ,  telemarketing and the spam
what is spam ? 
there are many companies that only send you emails to fill up your inbox . 
your inbox in your email
oh yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  so then we need to have a talk about that ? 
yes ,  we need to talk about the sells ,  tv ,  and cell phones as well . 
okay
you can write down the telephone number so that way they do not call you again . 
oh ,  yes ,  I have a caller ID
okay
It is connected to the telephone
mhm
unknow number ,  it´s always sales people so you leave a message telling them not to call you anymore . 
oh ,  okay .  yes
but you need to always see the caller ID
okay ,  okay
Well ,  maybe
yes ,  of course
okay
the government sets all the lists of the different people that calls sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn´t
it worked for me ,  I put my name there on the list
yes
and ,  after like thirty forty days I just received one call
oh ,  and which is that list ,  I mean ,  how does one apply for that ? 
the list is on the internet and basically you register you telephone number . 
okay
and then they send you an email and you have to confirm through the email they send you and after that they give the companies like forty days to remove you from
from their lists and after that if any company calls you eh ,  you can sue
ah ,  how good ,  I'm going to do it then ,  and that I look for it on the internet through who
mm ,  mm yes ,  ah ,  I don't remember the ,  the address also go to a search engine like google or something like that
okay
and put there eh ,  do not call list
ah ,  and there it comes out
there it will come out ,  yes
and is that only for the telephone calls or can it also be used for the ,  the interne  the no ,  email ? 
no ,  is only for the telephone calls ,  that's one of the questions that it said there that ,  that we should talk about that ,  that if we believe that something like that should exist for the email also
no ,  of course that yes ,  because  ,  isn't it true ? 
yes ,  yes mm
everyday you open the email ,  and like twenty five or more emails that shouldn't be there come out
yes yes ,  yes
like that you don't want ,  ah
yes there are some ,  some companies ,  for example my ,  eh ,  I have a school email that ,  this usually doesn't happen
and they have some really specific filters on the ,  the school email
yeah
but I also have a yahoo address ,  and yahoo also has a lot of really good filters
ah
ah ,  and so everything the think that's spam
yeah
ah ,  they send them ,  to a different folder so if you want to go to this folder and look over things ,  you have to determine if you want to read the messages they sent or not
ah ,  but many times also
yeah
eh ,  when you sign that you want to receive ,  I don't know ,  emails from a theater or from a story ,  what you want to receive
ah
they also send those there ,  because those e mails are also sent en masse . 
sure
and so the ,  the program can't determine ,  so it would be good ,  I think it would be good if there were this kind of thing also for the internet because
of course 
you wouldn't have to be looking on the whole list of all the emails that you're not interested in to find what you want
sure ,  exactly yes ,  eh ,  yeah
hmm yes so ,  have you ever had a problem ,  have they sold you something that hasn't been
and l 
you haven't asked for something ,  that has come
yes ,  yes precisely ,  a little while ago I bought a ,  I can't remember what it was ,  but it was a ,  no ,  I do remember ,  I bought some slimming pills
mhm
through the telephone
mhm
I see ,  so ,  I got them and they said that you had a certain period of time to send them back for a refund and I sent them back the same day when I got them cause I decided not to take them . 
so ,  I sent them back that same day through the mail . 
mhm
I see ,  the problem was that ,  they said they never got them
mm
and ,  and ,  they said that I didn't return them in time ,  or they said that I didn't send them back before the end of the guarantee period ,  I was able to solve it
yes ,  sure
that has been the only time ,  I used to buy some herbs
mhm
I see ,  herbs remedies ,  homeopathic medicines ,  all those kinds of things but I've never had a problem with that . 
mm
Have you bought stuff ? 
no ,  I have never ,  when I get telemarketing calls I immediately ,  before they even start talking I'd hang up and not listen to what they had to say
I would immediately tell them that I was not interested and I'd hang up the phone . 
I see
but ,  but yes ,  I've had problems with ,  with my credit card
oh ,  really ? 
they also call you once in a while to offer you some product ,  which is not specifically theirs but promoted by them ,  and it was ,  ah ,  something to
oh ,  I had to get information about my credit or something like this ,  ans most of the times ,  eh ,  when I get call from ,  I don't know ,  my telephone company or
my credit card company ,  and there is a period to try the product and see whether you like it ,  I usually say yes ,  because  sometimes they give you a
part of ,  the person who is doing the call earns money depending on how many people accepts
sure ,  sure
so ,  I tell them yes ,  for them to have their account ,  nd eh ,  and this time they told me they would call me back if I wanted to keep the product
after the thirty day try period
I see
and they never called ,  so I thought they had cancelled it
I see
and then I got ,  I got charged for the service ,  so I called them and told them I was absolutely sure that the person told me they would call me back to see whether I wanted to go on with the product ,  right ?  ,  that I would get a call to cancel the product because otherwise I would have said no ,  because then I forget
aha ,  that they would call you back ,  I see
yes ,  so ,  I couldn't believe that ,  that my credit cared ,  which is a reliable company
because ,  if your credit card would have done something like that
sure
at the end ,  the ended up cancelling the charge ,  but ,  even so ,  you have to suffer the bad situation of calling and arguing with the person
sure ,  and prove them ,  somehow ,  that you are right ,  don't you ? 
sure ,  yes ,  yes
sure ,   yes ,  is very complicated ,  the other thing is that it's scary because I think that any person has access ,  eh ,  isn't it true ? 
mm
because you send your card to a part where you want to buy I don't know ,  a camera a video and then it turns out that you receive offers from different stores in other words ,  business
of electronics ,  then they say well and nothing ,  I haven't said anything
mm mm ,  yes ,  yes ,  and you the know the other problem I ,  that the lady that was talking ,  because eh ,  since those days they had the same topic ,  and I was talking with a lady and ,  and
and I told her ,  what happens is that there's a lot of these companies that what they do ,  they sell the information
sure
I mean ,  you buy any product today and no and no ,  you don't even know that your information can be sold because eh ,  they have ,  by law ,  the right to sell your information
sure ,  they pass it to others
so ,  then I think they should pass laws that were much more strict and that it would not be possible for someone to sell your information to other companies
exactly ,  only if you want to and it affects that ,  sure ,  but if not
mm sure
the privacy before anything ,  right ? 
mm ,  mm
where you send an email and ,  like an infinite amount ,  eight hundred emails  ,  infinite amount we say the
yes , 
Chileans ,  right ?  instead of eight hundred infinite amount and one that doesn't correspond that doesn't even have any idea of who they are
yes ,  yes no and the problem is that also many of these companies that buy the information yes
okay
ah ,  they look for people who are vulnerable ,  people who don't
exactly ,  who believe in everything they say
yes yes ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  also since they're not so used to hundreds of companies calling every day ,  many times there are companies that are fake and then
what they do
do you know ,  what happened to me a while ago ,  ah ,  I already knew ,  that they called on the telephone ,  saying that it was your credit card
hmm
yeah ?   And that it was your company ,  etcetera ,  so they said that there had been a charge
hmm
that was unjustified on your card for ,  eh ,  a lot of money ,  like many three hundred dollars ,  and they wanted to corroborate if you had made this charge
so ,  eh you say ,  eh ,  the person answered and said ,  no ,  I didn't make this charge .   yeah ?   and so they said good ,  and your number ,  like ,  you number is such and such ,  your address
is such and such ,  social security is such and such ,  the person says ,  okay ,  and your credit card number is this ,  he said ,  yeah ? 
hmm
like ,  you were convinced that the company was really calling you for your credit card ,  yeah ? 
hmm
they said ,  the only thing we need to corroborate is on the back of your card there are four numbers
hmm ,  hmm
yeah ?   can you give us this number to confirm that you're the person who hasn't made this charge ? 
hmm
so the person after everything ,  that this supposed company
hmm
I already knew here ,  she said ,  my numbers are such and such and with that she was doing a fraud
mm
okay ?  and the person would say well ,  then we are going to take from your payment that you haven't made too grateful ,  bla ,  bla ,  and bye and then the person would find that
at the time ,  ah no ,  and also they give them a name and a number where it said ,  eh ,  I'm I don't know ,  Jimenez or a person
mm
already of visa ,  and this is your reference number and call back if you have any doubts
mm
and they give them a number in the visa ,  okay ?  the number where they have to call
mm
so generally the people don't call
mm
but this person called and found out that such a thing didn't exist
mm
okay ?  and then he notified that in all this process ,  that half an hour already passed ,  already they had used his card ,  for more than one thousand dollars
wow
imagine that ,  so
yes ,  yes no yes no ,  they invent many things and and besides that since they have so much information is very hard to know who is official and who is not official

Always ,  always ,  every day ,  they call me twenty four hours a day . 
oh yeah
So I tell them that he's never there ,  that he's never there and when ,  the ,  the other day
aha
they start again in the morning ,  they call often to talk with the person responsible for the phone .  Because they want you to get offers by phone if you want to change company . 
and they give you endless explanations why you should change companies . 
aha yes
I let the answering machine answer ,  when I come from work my answering machine is all full plus the id caller also full
oh boy wow

oh ,  oh ,  oh
because ,  just figure ,  you want to have
they call you every day
every day ,  seven days a week ,  I get called
wow
and they leave me messages in the machine ,  they leave the numbers in the message identifier ,  once they didn't talk on the machine but yet they left me a number in the message identifier
oh yes
and I came and called back to see who it was
aha
and it was a company of magazine's subscriptions
aha ,  oh ,  yes
to subscribe with them ,  that they would send me five for free and afterwards I would start paying
aha ,  oh no
and I said no ,  I am not interested ,  call later or don't call at all ,  but they keep calling ,  I don't know what to do
What did you do for them not to bother you more ? 
oh ,  oh ,  oh ,  that's not good
no
oh ,  no ,  I don't have those problems
But ,  ¿what did you do so they wouldn't bother you on the phone ?  ,  or ,  or send junk mail to your house
No ,  no ,  no ,  uh ,  no ,  i don't have a problem with that
they don't even send you letters when children get lost or anything ?

Right ,  oh yeah
Right
Oh ,  and ¿did you change your number ? 
the phone number ,  i have changed it three times already
Yeah ?  ,  wow
but i don't know how they get my
wow
the last ,  the last letter I got is when I turned fifty ,  they told me that I had to apply for life insurance
aha aha
because I turned fifty and ,  you know ,  what I do ,  I put it in the disposal
aha
so that ,  so they didn't come back to bother me again
wow
But a girl told me last night who was talking with me ,  that her grandmother makes her rip up letters
ah
she does it in the tra  in the same envelope and she sends them back to them . 
wow
yeah
oh boy
this means that they shouldn't bother you ,  no . 
ah ,  ah
because there's a saying that says that for a good understanding ,  few words are enough . 
oh no
because they don't understand ,  they don't understand in any way . 
wow
tell me what you did so they didn't send you anything ? 
not ,  not much
But how did you do it ?

Sunday also ,  I don't know how they do it I don't know and the other time they called me that I had won a car
ah wow
from two thousand six in two thousand five still . 
oh
and ,  and it was ,  it was so that I would give a ,  a so that I would call them ,  so that like that they ,  to waste the phone it had to be . 
aha aha
so that the bill would come bigger .  That I had ,  then also they send me a lot of sweepstake letters .  They don't send you ? 
wow oh yeah
aha ,  they don't send you ,  they do send me a lot of sweepstake letters that I won
no
Hello
Hello
How are you ?  My name is Auria . 
What's your name ? 
Auria . 
Auria ? 
Yes
I'm Pilar . 
Pilar
Pilar ,  yes . 
yes ,  hello ,  nice to meet you . 
Nice to meet you too ,  oh
And ,  where are you calling from ? 
From New York
Oh ,  okay ,  well ,  I'm calling from Atlanta and it seems to me , 
mhm
that I ,  I'm sorry ,  I'm trying to get into my apartment but it seems to me that I forgot the door key . 
Wow
the ,  gate
Well ,  mm ,  what was I going to say ?  Oh ,  yes ,  today's subject is politics ,  isn't it ? 
yes exactly
You ,  understand a lot about politics ,  or not . 
I honestly don't .  no .  I don't want to say that I don't care too much about it but I don't , 
You don't follow it much ,  ah . 
I don't follow it much ,  exactly . 
well ,  I do follow politics a little but from my country ,  not this country ,  in the United States but I haven't been here that long like to understand the politics here much . 
The only thing I say is that I'm a democrat ,  but the truth is ,  that I don't trust the politicians too much it doesn't matter what party they belong to . 
yes on that we agree They are not to be trusted not ones nor the others ,  nor the others from there . 
yes exactly . 
The experience is that all the parties already that have the power . 
exactly
Do something bad ,  they always end up messing up in one thing or another . 
And well they are liars it hurts me to say it ,  but the truth is that they ,  they are more concerned with their own interests ,  and businesses ,  and contracts . 
yes
And scramble with the ,  with the law according to what they need politically . 
yes
And not according to what's best for ,  You know ,  the people . 
sure ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes Is true ,  the times in which the ,  the people voted and lived the politics so much because they thought that they could improve their lives . 
because they believed the promises of the politicians that ,  that the country ,  was going to improve the country ,  the conditions were going to improve .  Those times have already passed because very few people believe already ,  I . 
yes
I think that people don't believe them ,  they vote because they have to ,  or you usually have a preference ,  not
yes
because you really think it will mean a big change
Exactly ,  I always vote democrat just because among the two ,  that is the one that I feel closer ,  you know ,  the most important for people
For the poor people ,  for any colour ,  no matter
hum
And so I vote that party just because that is their ideology ,  but honestly ,  it's been a long time since I
they don't represent that anymore
yes ,  do you think there should be more parties ?  But ,  actually ,  it's the same in most of the countries ,  there is only two big parties and the rest .  .  you can't choose
Not much more ,  do you think there should be more ? 
I think there should not be more than three
Why not ? 
And ,  on second thought ,  here three is not convenient either ,  because the third party ,  the liberal ,  what's the name of that party ?  The liberal party usually all he does is just
supporting the pres  the candidate of their choice ,  republican or democrat
yes
To try to waste the
mhm
the vote .  But ,  I think that ,  no ,  I don't think there should be many choices because then people get confused ,  but ,  afterwards
yes ,  nobody could ,  eh ,  contr  to be able to governate ,  really ,  no
nobody ,  right .  Exactly ,  because if you have more than two parties ,  it means that the other parties have a different point of view to those two
And you already start with five or six or six ,  you know ,  different points of lives ,  views ,   well there's already a lot to choose from and many issues can be confused And
imagine there's going to be a lot of recount
The politic is an issue .  Is an issue that I think is better ,  the people already prefer not to think about it ,  because for me for example sometimes I got upset sometimes when I think about it . 
When I start to think in that really ,  I don't think is that hard to solve many of the country's problems ,  right . 
well
And ,  and they can't ,  they can't ,  or rather don't want to ,  they have other better interests ,  other things to do . 
Is true ,  but also part of the problem we have it for not voting . 
mm
Because the truth is that if each each ,  citizen would vote ,  well then ,  there will be power .  Because one the mass can say or not say ,  look . 
You are a liar ,  I'm not going to vote for you .  And the next ,  the future candidates already see that the mass cares ,  they vote and they try to improve to , 
you know ,  to get ahead . 
mm
But now is always the same percentage of people ,  and that same percentage belong to this group ,  to this other group and the politicians are ,  only care about those groups that vote . 
yes ,  yes
And those groups that vote up to now well You know haven't done anything as they don't want to know when their candidate has done something bad . 
yes yes is true that there are many people that ,  Is very unconditional ,  that vote ,  no matter what happens .  Though ,  though for example the previous elections despite all the things that there were against Bush . 
Ah ,  well they've won the elections ,  there were so many people that had voted anyway because they don't start to think really ,  what is the best ,  or not . 
Exactly .  Exactly ,  and there are many people There are many people that now are starting to say ,  ah ,  perhaps he wasn't the best candidate and this and that . 
But there are others that don't want to admit that he has done wrong or has done things . 
yes ,  yes
that are not necessary for us ,  they just voted for him ,  the Republicans and the , 
Sure ,  it has to be good . 
And that's all .  Exactly . 
That's what their parents were doing ,  they are doing it too . 
But ,  you know ,  yes ,  the people ,  they would vote ,  all the ones that can vote . 
yes
They have a right to vote ,  that would be something else . 
yes ,  yes ,  it can be but you ,  you think ? 
And up to a local level ,  do you understand ? 
hum
because ,  where I live ,  the city where I live in ,  they wanted to pass a law to raise taxes ,  the taxes
yes
and less than one percent of the city voted so they increased the taxes
sure
You know ,  the ones that voted I'm sure own some businesses and the business people ,  and they care about that because they are benefited in some way . 
yes
and then the rest are their friends that live in this city ,  they didn't know what was going to happen and now they are complaining about it . 
I don't know they are not giving us the correct information so that they don't know that it's going to be voted . 
exactly ,  they are complaining right now and I'm like ,  you didn't vote . 
hum
If I had voted maybe it had not increased
of course
maybe if everybody had voted ,  the porcentage would be 90 %
what do you think ?  is there a big difference between republicans and democrats ? 
I believe they have different faces but indeed they are the same . 
mhm
they have ideologies that are different ,  but in the end everyone votes and this makes them the same
yes ,  the differences are very small ,  these are just fundamental things
yes
they are the same
yes
I believe that too
but I believe that if
the bush administration is doing a government out of the ordinary ,  he is doing things very dramatic
I think it has always been like that so
maybe the 70´s was not like that
yes
you know there was the civil rights movement and things like that
democrats were very different from republicans
mm
but that time is gone
yes
parhaps
Why do you think it has changed ? 
segregation no longer exists between politicians ,  well that´s what I believe
those were the only problems he had before . 
if also the U . S .  companies have changed a lot ,  political parties have also changed
you are right everything is controlled by companies with interests
exactly
I think that these companies are the ones that put politicians in power
exactly ,  that is the problem with the system we have
ye
you know that money talks
yes ,  unfortunately that is the true
yes
but this happens everywhere for instance I just came back from Europe and it was not like that over there
okay
for example the United States rules because they have money
the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorest
yes
And the world is going very badly .  But well
mm yes Well and ,  and in the country where I come from ,  you know ,  from my culture which is Puerto Rican ,  the political system there
Basically ,  is like saying a fight between two families .  There's already nothing ,  there's nothing that distinguishes it ,  except either you are popular ,  or you are independent or you are , 
mm
for the party of the United States . 
yes is like you see in a soccer game . 
And one sees ,  and you are born in that ,  because if your family is such and such ,  well you are already that and you can't change from that , 
hello ,  hello
hello
eh I'm Nicole I'm from New York
eh no pardon I didn't hear you too well ,  what's your name ? 
ah Nicole
Nicole ,  and where are you calling from ? 
Nicole yes from New York
ah my name is Any ,  I'm calling from Miami
ah hello ,  how are you ? 
yes
eh ,  where are you from ? 
from Miami
ah I mean but from what country
oh Puerto Rican and you ? 
ah okay eh I was born here in New York but my family is Cuban
ah
eh well the topic is the police
I didn't understand much what it was saying the only thing that it was of politics
yes I mean I think that they said if the republicans and the democrats are really two distinct parties or if they are very similar and if there should be traditional parties
aha
I mean ,  more than those two and and how many and how and I don't know don't know what what do you think of the politics here in this country
eh I don't know is so complicated
mm
eh I think that you know is not necessarily the best person for the job who wins but rather the person that has the most money because is the person that
mm
that can have you know more ads on TV ,  on the radio
sure
in you know wherever
sure
but
sure and well also I think that the person that wins is the person that protects the interests of the ones that have money I mean the ones that have money move
yes
the politics in this country so is not only paying the ads but also eh the power in other words match the favor of the
of the ones that have money
mm ,  I don't know I'm not too you know of politics or anything of that
mm
because it has its good thing and the bad ,  each one
mm
but you know I've never gotten too much into that
mm
I vote when eh you know it's time to go vote but no and also when I go to vote I always try to educate myself
mm
to whom I think would be the best person for the job but
mm
I'm not one of these people that you know that read the newspaper ,  watches the news or whatever to see what is happening with the politics . 
mm
but I do think that we have to give the eh respect and honor to the office
mm
what I want to say with this is how the office of the president
mm
can be that I eh don't like what they are doing . 
mm
but at the same time is the president and I don't see
mm
anything ,  eh good that comes out of the people that criticize the president because that doesn't help
mm
the only thing that does is that it divides
mm
you know we are going to say the people
mm
and it is of no help ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  that won't help ,  do you understand what I'm saying
yes yes
but ,  you know ,  it's like all those things that took place when the hurricane struck New Orleans ,  I mean ,  people started saying good or bad things of the President ,  whatever
m
but they weren't helping the people of New Orleans
m
they were just criticizing the President but if they go and say that the President is doing something wrong ,  well ,  then they should tell him what to do ,  do you understand what I'm saying ? 
yes ,  oh ,  I'm sorry ,  I don't ,  I mean ,  I think lots of people that were criticizing the President were also helping
mhm
I mean ,  people from this country ,  I mean ,  they were donating money to people or they were giving them clothes and and and
mhm
a place to live ,  and shared their homes and furniture I don't know ,  they went there to help I mean ,  to say that people were not
doing anything is false ,  I mean ,  some were criticizing too but I mean ,  I think they were right in doing so ,  I think
yes
they were right in complaining ,  I mean ,  they were complaining because not much was being done and I think it was necessary for them to complain and do something
yes ,  that's what
I mean ,  to complain about the President and don't do anything ,  I mean ,  I believe they were doing something , 
if you don't agree with that ,  then you should complain and do something ,  I mean ,  if you complain and don't do anything is just wrong ,  you must change things yourself
so I don't think they should sit and waiting for the next elections to take place in four years because in the next election ,  something similar might happen and you really can't trust
that the politicians are going to do things honestly and legally ,  so I'd say that people should complain and I think they should continue complaining and to do more things
I mean it's more difficult now to do more things ,  it' harder if you are a normal person ,  oh ,  I mean ,  you can't do the same job that
the President should be doing but you can try ,  I mean ,  you can try to do something from where you are ,  but ,  oh ,  but I
don't know ,  I mean ,  I don't completely agree with what you just said about people not being able to criticize him because I believe that when
you see that something is wrong ,  you should say it
I'm not saying that they shouldn't criticize but I believe the can do it but I don't like it when people start oh
complaining and speaking bad things about others without proposing a solution
sure
if they want to say something ,  you know ,  it's not a good idea to do this or whatever ,  then they should give a solution
sure
because if they don't then only thing that happens is that other people start ,  oh ,  you know
to be on the defensive
and this happens ,  I believe that when someone criticize another person without proposing a solution ,  they confuse the situation
sure
they don't help and that's what I didn't like ,  I saw a lot of people saying this is wrong but you know
mhm
they did it but at the same time ,  they didn't propose a solution
sure
the only thing they did was complain
but what could they do ,  I mean ,  the problem is that they are not part of the government so it's harder for them to do something ,  I mean
mhm
I didn't like too much how Bush eh responded to the situation in in New Orleans I mean I think that he really was like a lack of of
mm
it was like having a country without a president in that situation I mean effectively he like didn't do anything but since I don't know what I could do except give money
I mean I could contribute money to the effort of helping the people there or could
mm
go go over there ah ah ah work there I mean to work in the effort or donate some of my things I mean like throwing some things of mine
but no I can't do the work that he should be doing
mm , 
I'm not the president ,  him I don't know is like I don't know ,  I don't know is hard ,  is hard being a politician because one has to make a lot of decisions and
always the people are looking at you like to criticize I mean the people are never satisfied with what the president is doing any president I mean the people are always full of complaints
but ,  but I don't know sometimes I think that that also in a certain way like it keeps keeps like alive an environment of thinking
mm
that if the people stop criticizing in other words stop complaining and criticizing like the  people stop questioning a lot
and in absence that can be very dangerous also
yes yes
in a situation where the people continue without questioning like there could be very bad things
mm
so now a lot of complaining and little action doesn't do much
yes
is better to complain and do and act but I don't know
well is also better than in other countries
mm sure
because at least one can ,  one has the option of being able to complain and can say whatever one wants
sure
not in other countries
so far but probably they will take that away from us also very soon but
I don't think so ,  because of the constitution that we have I don't think that will happen
I don't know ,  I don't know well the I mean that movement of ah what is it called I forgot the name of this movement that they can
they can see eh all the things that one does ah I forgot what is called ,  well but there's been a lot from September eleven there's been a lot of movement of taking away
the rights of the people I mean especially if one is an immigrant here be careful like one says because you are seeing right that you are seeing in the house a person like that
anyone but if they have any suspicion if one sees a Muslim or I don't know I mean eh ,  I think it could be dangerous to say what one thinks
and in this country in the past it was very dangerous to say what one was thinking in the fifties I mean the people absolutely had no right to say what they thought
because if one if they suspected that one had communist thoughts they could take you out of your house I mean I think that yes the constitution well I well I defend the constitution a lot
but I think that it is very I mean in practice that constitution is not followed as much

But you are from Catalonia ,  yes ,  you told me that you were from Barcelona ,  yes
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  I'm from Barcelona ,  yes
yes ,  talk to me of ,  of the difference of the people let's say from Barcelona ,  to the people from Madrid
Well ,  all complicated ,  let's see ,  um There's a lot of difference I think at a level ,  well .  at a linguistic level ,  or at a political level
um they are ,  I don't know ,  two very different regions ,  what happens is that ,  well is in ,  let's say that Spain is a group of towns ,  no ,  well they all are ,  together ,  and that
yes
Well more or less ,  no ,  we coordinate ,  but ,  I don't know a Basque ,  an Andalusian ,  a person from Madrid ,  a Catalan ,  are really very different ,  there's no ,  and for historic reasons also ,  um
Catalonia and Castile ,  let's say united ,  like four centuries ago ,  which is a long time but that ,  that I don't know ,  each one conserves their history let's say ,  and their different roots
And ,  already ,  they were already formed cultures that not necessarily ,  eh ,  um ,  can ,  um ,  unite
uh ,  yes ,  yes sure ,  sure ,  I mean um and even ,  I don't know ,  I think that in the twentieth century like there's been ,  a very strong migratory movement from ,  for example from Andalusia ,  or from Extremadura to Catalonia ,  well ,  that has contributed to unify us a little ,  no ,  but
but a century ago ,  well in Catalonia nobody spoke Spanish ,  or ,  few people let's say ,  the elite spoke  Spanish ,  but the town people ,  well ,  no ,  no
how interesting
Um ,  perhaps they understood it but they didn't speak it and nowadays ,  everybody speaks Spanish in Catalonia ,  I don't know also the TV and those things ,  well contributes ,  no ,  that we all are more ,  more uniform
but there are even differences ,  and there are misunderstandings sometimes ,  and there's , well ,  stereotypes ,  these are like that ,  these are there .  The Catalans have a reputation of being hard workers
Um ,  um
and of being ,  very thrifty ,  that gives them a certain bad reputation sometimes  ,  in the rest of Spain
yes ,  uh ,  uh ,  Um . 
and and yes ,  and now ,  precisely ,  now or tomorrow ,  they leave ,  they are renewing the ,  the Catalonia statute ,  lets call it the constitution of Catalonia , 
it is ,  it is being updated ,  lets say ,  they've written a new
Oh . 
and and well ,  there has been some controversy because this new constitution ,  lets say ,  defines Catalonia as a nation which is part of Spain ,  no ,  a nation within a State , 
yes what does that mean ? 
well ,  it means that in certain areas ,  like in education ,  or certain economical competencies ,  I mean ,  there will be more autonomy ,  lets say ,  Catalonia has a
she has a special place within Spain
Oh oh
it will be more autonomous than other regions ,  lets say ,  well ,  in Spain ,  they call it history regions . 
Oh . 
and well ,  basically ,  Catalonia ,  the Basque Country and Galicia are well ,  that's the idea ,  they are different towns , 
Oh Galicia ,  I didn't know ,  I knew about Basque and Catalonia . 
yes ,  Galicia ,  too ,  well ,  they have ,  they have their own language ,  what happens is that Galicia ,  is much more ,  lets say the difference have diluted
And the language of Galicia is the Gallego ,  it's similar to Portuguese ,  it's original from the people of ,  um ,  um
Gallego ,  yes yes ,  Gallego and Portuguese ,  they are quite similar ,  it's really difficult to distinguish which one is which
yes yes yes ,  like no
it's a dialect ,  no ,  you could almost say that they are dialects of the same language ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
yes ,  um ,  um ,  um ,  um ,  um
While ,  well the Basque is completely different lets say it has nothing to do with it and Catalan is a romance language
yes ,  totally ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  um ,  um
but ,  that ,  more different from the Castilian ,   which is also becoming Castilian a little ,  for all ,  for all the constant contact that there is
um .  yes . 
but ,  but yes ,  is a complex topic . 
And ,  and ,  what types of freedoms ,  eh ,  of ,  of regional autonomy ,  does Catalonia have that Andalusia doesn't have for example ? 
Um ,  for example .  Catalonia has its own politics ,  the national politic is different in Catalonia than in the rest of Spain
And ,  and ,  and the rest of Spain shares a national policy ? 
Exactly ,  the ,  our country has its own police ,  Catalonia has its own police ,  and the rest of Spain has a common one ,  so to speak
Um ,  um .  Ah ,  um ,  um . 
Um .  yes ,  then ,  I don't know ,  I also think that ,  what they teach in the school ,  is ,  a large part ,  eh ,  is ,  decided by the ,  by the Catalonia parliament ,  not by the Spanish parliament
And how much is taught in Catalan and how much in Spanish ? 
Um ,  well for example ,  I ,  in my case ,  I studied everything in Catalan ,  except the subject of Spanish but all the subjects I did them in Catalan ,  and that ,  that is the norm ,  what happens is that some schools ,  that well ,  teach the Spanish . 
Ah . 
But the norm is that all is in Catalan ,  except the subject of Spanish ,  what happens is that Catalonia is a very bilingual society ,  then you hear the Catalan and Spanish
indistinctly in all parts ,  you hear it in the street ,  yes ,  Catalan ,  Spanish ,  the television has both ,  I don't know ,  there's ,  there's a lot of blend . 
yes ,  um ,  um
Um ,  unless you live in ,  I don't know ,  in in a very complete everyone ends up ,  more or less
yes ,  I can imagine ,  yes ,  yes ,  and ,  and ,  in the Basque Country ,  how is it linguistically ,  eh
Um ,  um ,  yes . 
Do they also maintain the language ? 
Um ,  not so much ,  not so much . 
Um ,  um . 
I suppose because ,  like ,  being so ,  so different ,  and ,  in Cataluna ,  or like
Exactly .   Um ,  um . 
everyone who's more or less from a Catalonian family or even ,  no ,  it's really easy to absorb the language and to learn
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  um ,  um . 
In exchange the ,  the Basque country not so much ,  even the Basque president I think doesn't know how to speak Basque ,  and ,  and it's a president of a national party ,  um ,  nationalist ,  like ,  pro Basque
Ah .   Um . 
But ,  um ,  I think that it's hard to speak Basque ,  and I think that in the scho 
And is there someone ,  there isn't ,  but ,  are there pockets of people who speak it as a first language ? 
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes they speak ,  what happens is I think that they don't speak as much as in Cataluna ,  it's a
Um ,  um . 
the situation is a little ,  well ,  less measured ,  but ,  yes they speak it and there are schools entirely in Basque I think ,  but few
And there's a movement ,  eh ,  to get bring the Basque back more ,  I imagine that this would be part
yes ,  um ,  I don't know ,  the Basque country has a government ,  well ,  a nationalist ,  pro Basque ,  but I think ,  like in Cataluna ,  um ,  I don't know ,  the language is something really important to us
and we give it a lot of weight ,  I think that in the Basque country this isn't as important ,  I think that
Ah ,  how strange . 
I don't know ,  they don't give it as much weight as we do ,  they don't discuss it a lot ,  because in Cataluna they're always talking about Catalan ,  and Castellano ,  and if one is worse than the other
Uh huh ,  Uh huh . 
All day we're like this .   And ,  and I think well ,  neither ,  but I think that in the Basque country they don't talk about it as much
Ah . 
of this topic . 
Um ,  that ,  it surprised me a little that ,  because that ,  is such a part of the cultural identity of a town . 
yes ,  what happens is I think is that they have it as ,  have ,  I think they have the Catalan as very assumed ,  already like something of theirs also
yes ,  um . 
That not just for talking Catalan they stop being any less Basque ,  while that Catalonia ,  um ,  is not so much like that ,  no ,  yes ,  I don't know ,  the Catalan is one thing and the Spanish is another
Okay ,  okay .  Um ,  um .  Um ,  um ,  um ,  um . 
And ,  well ,  that's the impression that I get ,  I could be wrong . 
yes ,  And ,  and ,  the Basque government now what relation does it have with the ETA as ,  as far as its political methods . 
Ah ,  let's see ,  the ,  um ,  the party in charge in the Basque Country is ,  um ,  ah ,  national party ,  is called the Basque Nationalist Party is ,  let's say ,  of middle ,  middle right perhaps ,  middle
but ,  I mean ,  they don't ,  don't give ,  don't give support to the violence at all ,  they ,  well are against the violence ,  are against the  ETA
ah ,  what happens is that ,  um ,  that yes that ,  yes that they have an orientation ,  well ,  um ,  nationalist plus liberties ,  and then already ,  in the Basque Country there's another party
that it is like the ,  the branch ,  the political branch of the  ETA so to speak ,  that they are ,  well ,  they don't condemn the attacks ,  they have a ,  have a much more ambiguous attitude ,  towards the violence
Um ,  um
And these people were ,  in fact ,  under um ,  the ,  under the Aznar government ,  the president that there was before in Spain ,  they banned that party ,  we banned it . 
Um ,  um .  Um . 
And ,  um ,  but this people well ,   well continue ,  they have changed names ,  and I don't know what ,  I mean ,  they continue being there .  And ,  and now with the change of the government ,  I mean the ,  the old one
the president that there was before ,  with the party that there was before ,  they didn't talk with the president of the party ,  of the Basque Country ,  they didn't talk to each other ,  then ,  let's say that it was hard to advance in some solution because they didn't talk to each other
And ,  and ,  and they didn't talk with the president ? 
Aznar ,  didn't talk with the president of the Basque Country ,  they didn't talk to each other ,  yes they were like ,  I don't know ,  three years without meeting ,  outrageous
Um ,  um .  Um .  Um . 
And now ,  with th new government ,  at least they do dialogue ,  they do meet ,  I mean ,  mm ,  there are still differences ,  right ?  but
at least they talk ,  which ,  which is a good way to ,  I don't know ,  solve something
Um ,  um ,  and in Spain ,  how do they see ETA ? 
Well ,  in Spain it is seen as something terrible ,  I don't know ,  like something ca  ,  that ,  whe  ,  ETA first appeared during Franco's dictatorship ,  so
yes ,  yes
maybe at that moment it made sense ,  because well ,  there was a dictatorship and ,  I don't know ,  they had been through some really tough situations and ,  I don't know ,  maybe in that historical moment
it had a reason to be ,  but now ,  most of the people ,  mm ,  think that in a democratic society it has no room ,  when there can be democratic parties who defend all those ideas ,  right ?  ,  in Catalonia there are parties who ,  independentist parties
but who just don't use violence
Um ,  um ,  um ,  um
Um ,  the problem is ,  the right thing is that ,  that in the Basque country ETA does have some social support ,  because otherwise
otherwise it would not have survived ,  right ?  I mean ,  this people ,  ETA ,  I don't know
Right ,  yes

No ,  that could ,  could be seen any moment ,  right ?  for the in each country ,  right ?  always things happen

Oh . 
The governor is Sonny Perdue who's a republican but that the majority of the people are
Aha . 
don't agree with that ,  right ?  that's he's taken many wrong steps here in Georgia
Really ?

Mm
It hasn't benefited the State that much ,  above all the people ,  the teachers and the
Mhm . 
State workers are not very happy with him so I don't think he will be reelected ,  I hope he's not . 
Yeah
I don't like him neither . 
Do you know the name of his wife ?

Yeah ,  yeah
Right now ,  no ,  he's here ,  he has a steady job ,  so
Mm ,  and
we are here for now
yes ,  and

President Bush . 
Well ,  he's don't things ,  he's done many things ,  he's done some things that are positive ,  we have to recognize
Yeah . 
he's had some hits
Yeah .   True . 
No ?   But ,  like ,  in the majority of cases ,  above all in this Iraq war ,  I think that many people are against his decisions ,  no ? 
No ,  he's really ,  eh ,  only spending the taxes of the American ,  no ?   In ,  in like ,  all this ,  this money ,  no ? 
There's many people who are suffering here in America and all this money that's going to this war in Iraq ,  it's completely ridiculous . 
Yeah ,  yeah
No it's really ,  it's really ,  it's ridiculous and besides there are so many people who have died ,  for the pure
okay
yes ,  so
he is very young
yes ,  I do not agree with him ,  right ? 
yeah
I think he only works on his own ,  not to help others
what about me ? 
yes ,  the last one was here the hurican Katrina
Oh ,  really ? 
it destroyed New Orleans
okay
it was a disaster right ?  because
oh ,  yes
No ,  they did not respond ontime . 
oh ,  no
the people have suffered a lot everywhere . 
that´s truth
here on Georgia we have a lot
that´s bad
Many people lost their homes
Ah ,  yes .  Ah ,  yes ,  how bad . 
No I think that in Texas and in many places
Ah . 
also ,  right ?  people that have gone from New Orleans
Yeah . 
because really is ,  is a disaster there . 
Eh ,  is a
No ,  maybe if there would've been a ,  a quicker response eh ,  it would've avoided
aha . 
avoided many ,  many problems ,  right ? 
yes ,  many problems . 
But up to now is ,  up to now ,  that's already a big screw up that it has given him ,  right ?  like it says
Yeah .  And you know that now eh ,  uh ,  another problem also
Sure ,  another problem ,  although with that already ,  they already had the election the first ,  I think ,  and they gave no at least they acted more quickly
Yeah ,  Ah ,  no ,  right ?  yes ,  is very fast
Mm . 
but ,  you know is a big problem in ah
Well ,  really ,  yes ,  is a
New ,  New Orleans and ah
Mm . 
ah ,  ah ,  Louisiana ,  right ? 
yes . 
There's a lot of water . 
Louisiana ,  Mississippi
Ah .  Mm , 
today ,  and all that ,  that now the gas is so expensive
Yeah .  Aha . 
everything is ,  yes ,  is a disaster ,  right ? 
yes . 
Really the majority ,  I think that ,  I mean ,  the people the people that live here that I mean ,  the majority of the people are not rich ,  right ? 
Right . 
The majority of the people are middle class and lower
Aha
then I think that it's affecting the people more ,  right ?  of middle class and lower we are suffering more ,  right ? 
Yeah . 
that the ,  other people ,  because the people that have money don't even feel it ,  goes up ,  goes down and there's not much
Aha .  And do you have a car ? 
yes ,  I have a car . 
Oh ,  I don't have a car ,  I don't
Ah ,  you don't have a car
I don't have
yes ,  I have a car ,  that's why I know ,  because now for instance ,  gas has increased
How much is the gas ? 
Here it is ,  eh ,  right it must have raised already to three dollars and some
Oh ,  my goodness ,  regular ?  regular gasoline ? 
yes ,  yes ,  because right now went my husband to buy gas
Oh ,  no
then ,  a lot ,  a lot of gas stations had no gas because they always save it ,  right ?  they wait for it to raise
Yeah
for the price to raise to start selling it
Mhm
and some ,  some were selling it ,  but at two ninety nine already ,  so tomorrow it may be at
Oh ,  goodness ,  mm
three and some
Oh my goodness
Mm
That's not good ,  what kind of car have you got ? 
Oh ,  I have a Volvo Sedan
Oh
Mhm
Oh ,  the new one
No ,  it's not new ,  it's from ninety six ,  but it's good ,  it's fast ,  it's not
Oh ,  yeah
Uh huh
I want a car ,  but it's very expensive ,  you know ,  i don't have the money ,  oh ,  you know ,  that's not good for me ,  uh ,  the gas
Right
The gas is really expensive
Yeah ,  gas is very expensive ,  it's too expensive
Uh huh
No ,  and my husband is so used to the car now and i tell him "you can go on the bus anyday"
¿right ?  ,  to a certain point to get to work ,  then you take the train from there
Oh
and ,  he says "no ,  i don't have the patience to wait for the train or the bus here"
Oh
"in Atlanta ,  because they take ,  i mean ,  they take too long to come"
Oh ,  you live in Atlanta ¿right ? 
Yes ,  in Atlanta
Oh ,  ¿is it cold [there] ? 
No ,  it seems right now we're .  .  .  it's changing a little ,  it has rained a little bit and it's kinda colder but
Yeah ,  yeah
we are about seventy six ,  so
Hi
Hi ,  ¿how are you ? 
Fine ,  ¿and you ? 
¿Huh ? 
Uh ,  my name is Zulma ,  uh ,  I'm in Texas
You're in Texas
Uh huh
Well ,  uh ,  this is Vicente ,  and I'm in New York
In New York ,  OK
Yes ,  i was ,  i was listening to what we have to talk about
yes
I believe it said we have to talk about politics
Yes ,  it was a bit difficult to understand everything it was saying ,  but uh ,  i think we have to talk about politics and whether
it's right or wrong that there are only two parties
And ,  and more or less the difference between both parties ,  ¿right ? 
yes ,  yes
Something like that and then it went on about too many things they're looking for
yes ,  yes
It's enough about the difference ,  but then it started talking about a party .  .  .  something ,  i didn't get what was ultimately in question ,  ¿you know ? 
Yeah ,  i didn't understand much of what it said
yes because I ,  and one ,  one and he had this gringo accent
yes . 
but the thing is that he says that the difference between the two parties ,  that's my understanding ?  Do you understand ?  One is more liberal and the other is conservative . 
Mhm .  Sure . 
But oh ,  the other ,  he then continued with something else that I didn't understand .  I couldn't understand it from there ,  do you ? 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
but I thought it had to do with politics ,  democrats and republicans ,  oh . 
Aha . 
That democrats are more liberal and the republicans are conservative . 
Mhm . 
and that many of the situations are both because you can't be ,  you can't be too liberal right ? 
Mhm . 
Liberal is good ,  but it does have some bad things too . 
yes , yes . 
And the conservatives ,  if they are too conservative then they don't help people and there can be trouble with that ,  do you understand ? 
yes but I think the politics in the United States ,  traditionally ,  there has always been two main parties ,  it's divided in two parties . 
All the chambers ,  the Senate ,  the House of Representatives and even in the local level ,  everything is divided into two parties .  So ,  oh ,  and and
even if someone is running for a political position and has different ideas ,  they can run because the parties have
so much power that if you are not a democratic or republican candidate you basically won't have a chance to win ,  to win that position .  I think this has limited the political life in the United States ,  it has prevented it from being diverse . 
So ,  you have to either believe what the democrats or the republicans say and if you don't ,  well you don't have a way of expressing your
your opinions that are worth something in the government . 
Well there are only two parties ,  there are many parties ,  but the thing is that the democrats and the republicans have so much that the other country ,  the other parties that try to climb
don't have enough votes to get to any position .  Do you understand what I'm saying ? 
Oh sure ,  yes .  No .  I understand that
There's there's there's a social party ,  there's a party of the working people .  All that exist ,  I'm telling you the truth that it exist ?  But
No ,  I I know they exist ,  but eh ,  but basically they are non existent because they haven't be able
to people because if the people don't
haven't been able Mm ,  yes yes yes .  yes yes yes . 
Ah that was going for president . 
yes ,  yes ,  mm  . 
He had a lot of money ,  a lot .  Money means money ,  understand ? 
Mm ,  Mm . 
So he himself could pay .  He didn't need any other person .  But he got got really on top there ,  close to the to the republicans and the democrats three parties had
close to three parties to vote understand ? 
Mm ,  yes ,  yes . 
But still the republican won ,  understand ?  But I'm telling you like that that yes eh parties exist .  This is the United States ,  you can't for what if no other party exists . 
Still they all need the vote of a certain amount of people eh .  To represent ,  understand ?  To be represented . 
Mm .  Sure ,  yes . 
The thing is now ,  to win is another thing . 
Ah no ,  sure ,  sure ,  yes ,  I understand . 
Understand ?  To win you have to do something else so if you
yes
You you think that you have to be like right ?  that had money for him to pay his own propaganda understand ? 
yes . 
Eh ,  you have that type of money another party perhaps you arrive and perhaps one of these days there could be a representative from the independent ,  or the family ,  or of the workers' party . 
Mm ,  mm
But the thing is that the republicans right ?  and the democrats are so big that it's impossible to get to any other part You need to have a very big idea ,  understand ? 
Sure ,  that's what I'm saying that for that for ah for historic and traditional reasons the United States has maintained only two parties that are majority . 
yes . 
And in the historical trajectory they haven't given the opportunity to any other party of
No ,  no ,  no .  They give it but it doesn't make it .  It doesn't make it ,  but it exist .  This in the United  
Because of that ,  because of that .  That's what I'm saying .  And and then
this is one of the most liberal countries in the world ,  see ? 
Ah . 
You want to start a a party a party if you want to start a political party today see ?  you can start it today . 
yes ,  Sure ,  yes yes ,  I understand that .  No ,  yes ,  yes . 
You can the book party and if the people support the idea of what you want ,  you can make it to be president .  You can become president . 
yes ,  oh sure sure .  I'm not I'm not saying that the laws prevent you that no that no
But the
You can start a political party if you want ,  of course .  The laws
Oh ,  exactly
the law allows that to happen ,  I'm just saying that the people in the United States
Exactly ,  the people
They haven't given another party the chance to reach power as the democratic and republican parties have
Aha . 
And that has caused that the politics in the United States has not evolved .  It has remained still ,  basically and oh oh oh ,  in things as basic as the vote system
Right ,  the vote system has been the same ever since the country was founded . 
And yes ,  but but
And now ,  the people realize that it's causing trouble and for example ,  the really basic problems start to appear in the in the United State's politics . 
it has not changed .  Mhm . 
look ,  it hasn't changed because it's the most perfect one in the world ,  but are they saying the truth ?  Are they ?  Is it the most perfect one or they are not changing it ,  look ,  I can tell you right now
Mhm . 
that if you want ,  right ?  I can get to ,  name a person ,  name a person ,  Micky Mouse ,  he's not alive ,  he might be alive ,  he can become President of the United States . 
Mhm ,  mhm ,  but I don't think that's perfect at all I think it's ridiculous that someone that has no eduction
But no no no no .  It's ridiculous
and and .  no ,  no ,  in the United States ,  money is more important
than education ,  look ,  oh ,  when you get to a certain education level ,  that's not important because you can have a PHD and
Do you understand what I'm trying to say ?  When you are a leader ,  leadership is very important ,  do you understand ? 
No ,  leadership ,  sure ,  leadership is important .  The thing is that the State's leadership ,  I mean ,  in the United States is established in part of the
Do you know what leadership is ?  Leadership
if people like you or not .  That's why ,  that's why a lot of
Not exactly ,  and that is the most important
Hollywood artist have managed to become president or governor
No ,  not exactly ,  because the inspiration of a le  of a leadership is more important than a book .  You can't learn that in a book .  I can't ,  I can't learn how to be a leader .  That is not possible ,  understand ? 
No ,  no ,  no ,  no .  Oh ,  of course you can't .  No ,  no ,  I understand
The , eh ,  the boss of ,  there ain't no book you can read
yes
to learn that because I may be the most ignorant person in the world
Mhm
but have the inspiration for people to see me as a good thing ,  then I can manage to be the President ,  understand ? 
I agree with you ,  one hundred per cent .  Leadership is
That ,  that is the most important thing .  When you get to a certain level
Mh
there is nothing you can put down to paper that says that another . 
No ,  no ,  no ,  I agree .  Leadership is a feature that
Nothing
develops ,  it is a part of your personality .  And you can't study it ,  no way
exactly
But if you are going to be a political leader ,  mm ,  there are other things that are as important as being a good leader
You must know of economy ,  you must know of laws ,  you have to ,  and all that you have to study
no no no no no no ,  I'm absolutely in agreement with you because you know why .  When I'm leadership ,  right ?  I can have consultations that tell me what I can do ,  and what I can say to people . 
Ah ,  but ,  mm . 
I give you counsel ,  I can have good counsel .  Look
Mm
I'm from Panama and there I see that ,  that there ,  there are the richest
MM
The richest come and people want ,  that this doesn't exist in Mexico nor in Forget About Mexico ,  if you aren't ,  if you aren't ,  if you aren't from ,  from Mexico there are the mixed race
The ones who are des  European descent ,  if you are not of European descent ,  you don't become the president of any Latino country . 
Mm ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
You understand me ?  If you are not of European descent ,  you can't become one ,  even though the population
Mm ,  mm hmm ,  mm . 
is Indian or mixed race ,  are in the majority ,  you see ?  You can't get there in any other place . 
yes
Because when you .  The political system of the United States is the most perfect in the world . 
Hm .  I don't believe that .  I'm not in agreement .  I believe that there are European countries that have much better . 
There is a man ,  there is a man ,  there is a man the rest of the world sees right now .  The majority of the world ,  right ?  They notice the United States ,  especially in European countries . 
They are changing their political systems all the time and they are adopting the laws of the United States . 
Mm .  Oh ,  no . 
Because the United States is more advanced than any other .  In the United States ,  in United States you find more problems here that don't exist in other places of the world . 
Now you have another person . 
Aha . 
I'm tell you that there are many laws that because it's more advanced that the rest of the world ,  you see ?   And people of the world ,  the rest of the world doesn't know .   Is there a ,  where are you from ? 
The rest of the world doesn't know this .   There are European countries that much before the United States gave the right to vote to women . 
Look ,  but the United States ,  look
Okay ?   No ,  the politics of many European countries are much more advanced than the United States . 
Let me tell you the United States but much more advanced than any other country because ,  you know why ? 
No ,  no ,  no . 
Because intellectually ,  the United States is one thousand years more advanced than
No . 
When you go to a small countr  if I go to a small country that has ten thousand people
yes ,  hmm . 
I can't compare their politics with the United States .   I can't compare it ,  you know ? 
Hmm ,  yes . 
In the ,  in the United States the system is more important than the president .   You know ?   Remember I could Mickey Mouse president
Hmm ,  yes ,  hmm . 
of the United States .   And it can be effective because the United States system is the most effective in the world . 
No ,  I . 
In Panama ,  this system in Panama adopted the United States system and many of the Latin countries are now adopting things from the United States because they're learning a lot more . 
No ,  I agree with you that many countries in the world look to the United States and are jealous with the system in the United States
Well of course ,  no ?   because
but because it is a system that is individualist and capitalist .  And here ,  who wants
Eh ,  the presidential system ,  yes
and wants to exploit the others and stand on everybody ,  I have the chance to do it and become rich
No ,  eh ,  eh ,  the
And that ,  everybody ,  everybody is jealous of that .  If you come here and want to make money ,  you can make money and you can exploit other people ,  and you can stand on other people ,  you can do it
It's not only the money ,  and not onl  it is not exploiting nobody .  No ,  it is not exploiting nobody .  You are learning how they live ,  because remember when the rest of the countries
No ,  some people do it right ,  it's alright
There is a country in the world ,  there is a country in the world who gives money to the rest of the world ,  if I have to tell you what country is that then
you are in not in earth .  There is a country that gives money to the rest of the world ,  do you know which is that country ? 
Thre are a lot ,  there are a lot of count 
That is the United States
Good evening I'm Joe hello
Hello ,  I'm Patrick
Oh Patrick from New Mexico . 
well yes
yes we've talked like three times we've talked ,  that's good I really like to talk a lot with you ,  how nice . 
Again yes how nice . 
How is everything fine ? 
yes everything is fine . 
And the weather is changing over there ? 
What ? 
The climate ,  is changing in New Mexico or is it still hot there
Ah no ,  no yes ,  well ,  the last ,  three days it changed .  There was a lot of rain and and ah ,  well the temperature went down a little no . 
yes And what do you think of politics Patrick ? 
Well ,  is ,  is a Is something very ah ,  Is very ,  is very hard to talk about the ,  the politics ,  because ,  I mean there are many things that . 
that one has to ,  that one has to think of no ,  ah um But that ,  I I think that the ,  the situation of ,  of our country . 
has to change ,  I think ,  that's my opinion . 
Oh ,  yes ,  I think that between the republican party and between the democrat you see something good in reality ,  but I think that now the is worse with the situation
presently .  Because things have worsened a lot with the republican party ,  right ?  with that of the war and the price increase and ,  the way in which , 
the issues are handled ,  like this of the storms that passed .  And the corruption that is now appearing ,  now from the republican senators in the congress . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes
so ,  those things don't help the image of the country at all . 
yes no pss no and And also the ,  the last elections ,  were very ,  very corrupt I think . 
yes ,  I think there's been corruption ,  for example with what happened ,  in no ,  that so much happened but the other ,  that President Bush won this , 
depending on the Florida votes ,  and I don't know like that ,  in reality for a few votes ,  well the vote of the whole nation was decided . 
Rather
yes is a part of the ,  of the topic ,  that ,  has ,  that has to change ,  that ,  the topic of ,  of voting ,  right .  That
Sure . 
all the votes ,  should count right . 
yes instead of doing it by ,  what is it called ,  by delegates ,  districts ,  by however .  I know that they should all count like that ,  that the majority wins ,  in reality that the majority wins and not that it wins , 
by how many delegates they have here or there . 
yes
Because that doesn't count ,  it shouldn't count like that .  No I was very disillusioned ,  with how the politic is and ,  And where they go walking ,  and
how decisions are being made like that .  Sending people to die to a war that makes no sense .  No ,  I don't think so . 
yes ,  yes um
And do you believe in the existence of other parties ,  do you think they should make more parties or ? 
um I think so ,  there should be more parties because ,  well
yes
They have three strong parties
yes
And also they have an ,  institution that ,  is like ,  like ,  goes checking ,  all the parties ,  that we don't have a ,  a ,  national  institution that is like
it is part of the parties to review all
yes
to check for cheating or not
as the two parties are very powerful Republican and Democrat
yes
the influence is very large in the American people but sometimes is not enough for both parties
sometimes they take advantage
yes
Now there is much more division then before ,  people disagree with many things
the nation is divided for example Louisiana is a poor area
you can not compare Houston and mississippi .  because the president is from there
for example in Texas things got better super fast ,  not as many people who died in Louisiana
truth who died in Louisiana and Mississippi
yes ,  yes . 
they are powerful parties and control everything
yes
not only matches ,  but there are also government agencies that must operate
yes , yes
for example FEMA took too long to take action when Hurricane Katrina was catastrophic
they took a long time to close something
yes
they reacted very ,  very slow . 
yes it is sad . 
yes and
And which parties dominate New Mexico ? 
Well it is ,  one of the ,  of the ,  of the States of battle ,  right .  of the
yes
then it depends .  the past elections ,  won ,  Bush won by little but in two thousand ,  Algore won By around six hundred votes ,  something like that very
Oh ,  yes
so ,  yes but in general I think that it is more than ,  the democrat . 
yes
the states . 
I don´t know when they begun to do this ,  and I don´t know how much ,  helps ,  for example ,  in Colorado so ,  I think they were going to have more .  Power in the votes . 
Because like Colorado is expanding to much too .  Well there they are going to have more .  Power in the votes but it really didn´t happen like .  at least this past year of the elections . 
the last time ,  didn´t ,  didn´t work Because they did not have it was not so organized and the did not have ,  the districts they wanted to have and give more power to Colorado . 
Compare to other places like Ohio ,  new York ,  Texas . 
yes
That have much ,  that have more power in the vote and I don´t know those things well of course ,  they affect .  The question ,  is like I was thinking about here in Colorado . 
It does not matter yes ,  if you vote or not because really states like these I said ,  Ohio ,  so Pennsylvania ,  all these states ,  New York .  Florida decides all . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes it must be .  for each district . 
Yes
Imagine that every district has a vote for the electoral college ,  ¿right ? 
Yes
And they must ,  uh ,  be spread ,  ¿right ?  ,  instead of being ,  uh ,  most of them win ,  they all win ,  like yeah
They definitely need to improve the system
But yes
Regarding that
uh ,  well ,  last semester
Right
i studied uh ,  politics ,  ¿right ?  ,  and there are two states who did change their laws ,  ¿right ? 
yes
Nebraska and Maine are like that
Yes
But i think that they always ,  they always go to ,  uh ,  Main ,  always ,  because it's always Democrat ,  and Nebraska always goes Repubilcan
I think ,  but yeah ,  they do have ,  they do have laws that votes can be distributed ,  ¿right ? 
That the majority of votes count ,  that's what they say
yes
oh
i mean ,  that they can spread their districts like that ,  if ,  if Bush wins in a district
oh
wins a vote ,  but if for example Kerry wins ,  another ,  but of ,  of the same state .  he can win that electoral vote . 
oh
I mean is ,  is more fair like that . 
Sure . 
Because ,  in our system now .  Although the election ,  is going very evenly the one that wins ,  wins all .  all the votes . 
yes
Like that ,  is not fair . 
Exactly .  And I also think with nominations for big positions ,  like for example supreme court chief ,  well that only is picked by the president
I think that there should be another way of deciding that because .  the president is always going to pick someone who leans towards his party .  And someone who supports his political system . 
Ah yes ,  yes is true . 
You understand me ?  But that doesn't necessarily ,  mean that it's for the well being of the nation is that all the influence . 
Hello ,  this is John from New York
Um ,  oh ,  ¿do you speak Spanish ? 
Yes ,  of course ,  good afternoon ,  I'm sorry ,  i forgot
Oh ,  well ,  oh
That we're talking in Spanish
Yes
And you ? 
Uh ,  I'm Pilar
¿Where from ,  Pilar ? 
From New York too
¿Yeah ?  ,  wow ,  I'm in Queens ,  ¿where are you ? 
In Manhattan
Oh ,  wow ,  that's good
Um
Uh ,  you can't understand very well what these people are saying ,  ¿right ?  ,  i know
No ,  the truth is i don't ,  but well ,  i understood the subject was politics
Yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  and ,  ¿where are you from ? 
Spain
Oh ,  spanyard ,  wow ,  that's good .  All my grand parents are from Spain ,  from the south
¿Yeah ? 
Yes ,  my ,  my grandmother was from the Canary Islands
Um ,  uh huh
So ,  i ,  i ,  i have gone to Spain many times ,  i love Madrid ,  Barcelona ,  Marbella
¿Yes ? 
Ibiza ,  yeah ,  ¿how long have you been here Pilar ? 
One year
Oh ,  ¿yeah ?  ,  ¿just one year ?  ,  and how different do you find it
Oh ,  the truth is it's completely different
Yeah ,  ¿right ?  ,  but you ,  ¿you lived in Madrid ? 
Yeah
But well ,  well ,  the only thing is that the night starts later than here
The night and everything ,  lunch ,  dinner
Yeah ,  yeah ,  and there's no nap
¿Where is there no nap ,  there ? 
In ,  uh ,  there's no nap here
Oh ,  there's no nap here ,  no
In Spain there is
Yeah ,  although
So ,  well ,  and ¿what do you think about politics ?  ,  well ,  i imagine Spaniards have many opinions about politics
Um ,  well ,  i don't know about the spanyards ,  i don't have much
No
Man ,  I have an opinion on Spain ,  but here in the United States
Hmm . 
I don't know the parties
yes yes well ,  they're the democrats and they're the
or anything
they're the republicans and
and little more ,  no ? 
no ,  we don't know which of the two is worse ,  no ?   they both have their good things and they have their bad things .   But well ,  and in Spain ,  the no 
In Spain it's ,  man ,  I don't know what the difference is between the parties ,  but there are also two that are the most important
yes . 
that are ,  they're called the Popular Party
Hmm . 
and the Socialist Party
Aha ,  aha . 
Spanish Worker and ,  they're pretty different ,  the truth is that they govern the country in a way
yes . 
I think that more than anything to contradict one another
yes ,  yes I think tha 
When you're in the government ,  the others don't do more ,  they complain about anything they do
yes . 
and when they themselves eh are in the government they dedicate to ,  undo all that the last government has done
yes . 
to be contrary ,  I think so
Exactly   That ,  yes ,  here ,  here is more or ,  is the same .  It is the same here . 
yes ,  right ? 
yes ,  yes . 
And the democracy ,  I don´t know ,  really if ,  if you could call  democracy when the elections
yes . 
so when the parties those you can choose or not you do not like any ,  yes ,  well yeah
yes .  Not specially ,  eh ,  see for example here even when I am in favor of the because the truth is that it has made many good things the Mayor of this place
Hmm . 
has been very good .  Originally he was democrat but he changed to republican
Hmm . 
and well ,  and now ,  acts like with ,  like a liberal ,  many times
yes . 
So ,  then ,  wait a second Hello ?  Hello ? 
yes ,  so that ,  you do not distinguish ,  so there is not a pure thing there ,  right ? 
yes ,  no ,  no ,  it is not distinguished ,  but at least him has been good for the city eh
Of course
because in this election are going to spend much money on TV Overhead announcements and advertisements
Mn ,  yes that is very sad
now there is only one coming out every day in the newspaper
first thing he said is that God would make him win the election because
he said that it was in god´s hands
All this week was a mistake ,  so everyone looks  at him like a clown
and what is its name ? 
Oh ,  Ferrer
Ferrer ? 
He is puertorican ,  from the Bronx
okay
yes ,  he is a clown
here in the United States people critizes very much
well ,  It has gotten better
good people no longer supports both parties
this city is a Democrat ,  yet he is a Republican ,  they are tired of Democrats
they have raised taxes
yes
so we have a mayor who is a Republican what is his Name ? 
so he is also republican
So you tend to be more of the center ,  right ? 
yes ,  exactly
They compensate each other
yes ,  yes ,  so ,  well ,  and so I guess you miss a lot Spain
Eh ,  well ,  on one side I do ,  but on the other side there so many good things here that I don't have much time left to miss
yes ,  yes ,  look ,  we have a ,  we have just refurbished the kitchen ,  and I found ,  online ,  a boy who is good at
painting ,  eh ,  mm ,  and plaster and everything ,  but really good ,  really good
Mhm
and he said ,  look ,  John I love my country and I miss it a lot but this country is giving me the chance to work hard ,  I have my car ,  I have my apartment that I have almost paid
and he is here ,  I think he has been here for three years ,  he is ,  he hasn't been here too long
yes
but he works hard ,  he is saving his money and he says 'here I have the chance wile there I couldn't ,  because when it was not the taxes it was some other thing
Yes ,  the situation in Spain is very bad for the young people
And could not ,  and so that's how it is
because salaries are ,  although the standard for living ,  I mean the cost of living has raised a lot
yes
because ,  because of the euro
yes
when we changed to euro ,  everything raised ,  up to a seventy percent
yes ,  yes ,  wow
some things went up
Wow . 
and ,  but the salaries didn't go up at all . 
Mm . 
they did the fair conversion to the salaries but not to the prices
yes . 
then the salaries are very low and that's the first problem ,  right ? 
yes ,  yes . 
but the second problem is that the houses ,  the eh ,  the price of the houses
Mm . 
ah ,  has been increasing since many years ago to some prices that are ridiculously high that nobody can afford to buy ,  I mean the people that
that can buy a house are only the ones that are ,  charging with the housing
yes ,  yes . 
the ones that buy ,  the ones that buy houses to rent or to resell
yes . 
but not the people that need to live in them
Exactly . 
they can't pay the house
yes ,  that is what has happened here now in New York in the last five years ,  the prices have been double
yes . 
The luck that we bought our house five years ago but double ,  it's more than double than when we bought it so ,  it's ridiculous truly
so ,  but well
and the rents ,  well ,  eh Spain at least the rent is more reasonable because ,  I don't know ,  it's not very widespread
yes ,  yes . 
there aren't many renters ,  so they aren't very expensive
And ,  and ,  and
here they're really expensive ,  really expensive
And you haven't tried to find something outside of Manhattan ? 
No ,  I'm studying in a university . 
Or you don't like it ?   Ah ,  what university are you in ? 
En ,  in Colombia . 
Ah ,  wow ,  ah ,  you're in uptown
Sure ,  yes . 
yes ,  but up ,  up there ,  up there in uptown you can ,  Washington you can get ,  eh
No ,  the ,  the university ones are cheaper ,  but ,  that's why I'm here ,  but
yes . 
that in general the prices you're seeing are for renting ,  they're really really expensive in New York . 
yes ,  yes ,  no ,  eh ,  they're
Almost unpayable in the lower part of New York ,  they're simply expensive ,  almost
yes ,  yes . 
but
Wow . 
and ,  but in Spain there's a tradition of ,  of buying the house ,  people don't like to pay rent because it's money
Thrown away ,  yes ,  exactly . 
more or less thrown away ,  and they always want to buy a house ,  but it's impossible ,  people can't ,  this is why many people are going
yes . 
because they can't ,  because they both have to work ,  the husband and the wife ,  and they can't have kids
Hmm . 
in Spain ,  I don't know ,  it's a bit of a simple society ,  what people want is to get married
Hmm . 
have kids and their family and little more ,  well it's that ,  you can't do this in Spain . 
yes .  And ,  and God willing the parents give them a little money to start ,  no ? 
Sure ,  well this was before ,  before the parents gave us a little money to start and well ,  it's that the money the parents can give isn't enough now
yes . 
unless the parents are rich . 
Right ,  right ,  wow . 
So the situation is very bad ,  and this is why ,  people are going like out in Europe
Hmm . 
now it's ,  hmm ,  there's problems going anywhere in Europe to work
Hmm . 
well many people are leaving
Wow ,  um . 
and that's one thing that those politicians right ?  that had to solve it and is always being discussed
yes . 
that they have to ,  well in fact they are building official protection houses ,  they are called
Mm . 
that are houses that they build and they sell them quite a lot cheaper . 
yes ,  yes , 
But they are not enough
Mm . 
is a disaster
Wow ,  uh .  Wow ,  listen tell me ,  have you found a good restaurant here ? 
Mm ,  I haven't looked . 
You haven't looked ?  I'm going to recommend you one ,  is one that's in ,  that's in the street eh ,  in the tenth and first avenue
In tenth street and first avenue ,  mm . 
yes ,  it's called Xunta with  X
Really ?  I mean that is Basque or ,  or is
Yes ,  Xunta .  There ,  you will feel with ,  with your fellow countrymen very good ,  eh ,  is very ,  how do you call it ?  eh for the young people ,  right ? 
and they serve very delicious ,  the ,  the tapas are very delicious and is very ,  What's the word ?  Is very Eh ,  fantastic .  Right ?  eh ,  ah ,  I'm looking for another eh ,  eh ,  bohemian
yes .  Ah ,  uh .

Okay ,  thanks a lot . 
yes ,  so ,  I recommend you by up there ,  by up ,  uptown the only thing there is are Dominican restaurants and and there's still some Cuban ones left ,  which are quite good ,  but
Spanish ,  that I know ,  by up there no
No
there isn't ,  but Xunnta ,  if ,  if you have the chance of going with your friends eh ,  to Xunta ,  you will like it a lot
Okay ,  Okay ,  well I'll go ,  I'll go to see . 
Yes ,  there immediately you hear the voice of your homeland
Mm . 
because that gets full of ,  of Spaniards
Well here in the university there's also a lot of Spaniards ,  that no ,  yes ,  yes
Oh ,  yes ,  also ?  you don't say . 
Studying ,  many . 
Wow .  Yeah ,  wow ,  how nice ,  how nice . 
Well ,  let's talk a little more of politics that if not ,  the call is not going to count
yes ,  no ,  no ,  I don't have is that I've been doing this already a while that I've been doing this ,  and ,  no you know ,  they
is ,  first that you don't understand what ,  what they are saying that ,  I already wrote them an email the other day I told them listen
at least you should have put a person that speaks Spanish so that
yes . 
to say ,  so that it can be understood clearly ,  he says no ,  yes ,  is that we didn't have and then we are going to look for one ,  and are going to record it all again and
and I said well ,  that's good ,  but let me tell you that you can't understand anything some times . 
But sometimes it doesn't have ,  but sometimes they use words that don't exist . 
yes ,  exactly ,  exactly .  So ,  anyway
And besides is the same topic every day ,  is a bore . 
yes ,  yes ,  also ,  there have been many days the same topic so ,  but well ,  about the politics I think that ,  at least this city is
is marching ahead ,  is very safe the crime has decreased a lot and
the city is doing well ,  but the country
yes ,  same ,  the country needs a lot of work . 
Yes ,  true
So ,  but if you have the chance you should also eh ,  take a little trip by eh ,  by mm ,  now ,  now that is autumn ,  now the colors change in the

Uh ,  here in Philadelphia ,  so yes ,  I'm dedicated to that most of the time
And ¿where are you from ? 
I'm from Mexico ,  from Mexico City
Right
I just moved like three years ago just to study ,  ¿and you ? 
So ,  uh ,  i was born in Puerto Rico but my fathers came to the United States when i was five years old
Oh ,  OK
So uh ,  I've lived in Miami for almost all my life
And you go back to Puerto Rico a lot ,  don't you ? 
Oh
Yeah ,  you go back to Puerto Rico often ,  don't you ? 
No ,  not much because i was born in Puerto Rico ,  but my parents are actually Dominicans ,  so
Oh ,  OK
The whole family is Dominican but I'm
mm
you know ,  the lady that raised me was Puerto Rican
okay
you know ,  I have like a mix of both
okay ,  how interesting
well and
And
how is the politic let's say in Mexico ,  that I'm not ,  I don't know much . 
how is the politic in Mexico I think that right now is in one of the worst moments ,  because not long ago ,  we had always had the same party ,  the Pri ,  for like seventy years
aha aha
And it barely changed with Fox I mean the president that we have now .  But what has happened ,  is that everybody had the hope that it was seriously going to be different
aha
And it has been much worse than before ,  in other words ,  he hasn't done anything that they used to do before  And the little good that the government did before ,  he doesn't do it anymore
then we just had a change for worse then the people already don't
wow
don't care at all now ,  they are already disappointed
aha
that they don't even pay too much attention to the politic ,  they are not interested anymore in voting ,  is already like whoever it is they know that it will be bad ,  so they don't care too much . 
wow
mm And here ,  did you vote here oh
oh yes ,  of course
they voted
yes ,  I'm not really into it right now because I have a small child and I live for her
yes ,  I believe you do
so ,  oh ,  politics ,  you know ,  I ,  I don't really know if it's okay or wrong but what I do like is that at least ,  oh
people can say what they think
mhm
I know that in my parent's country ,  the Dominican Republic ,  it wasn't always like that ,  I don't know if it's like that now or not ,  you know ,  you have had that problem in Mexico too ,  right ? 
yes
but ,  I was raised in a way in which politics were not discussed for that same reason
really ? 
yes
Okay
so ,  you know ,  I speak with my husband but we don't discuss politics
You don't talk about many
I don't give my opinions about it or anything like that because you know ,  where they come from ,  you weren't able to say what you thought about
the party in power ,  it could cause you lots of problems
yes ,  that's right
so ,  oh
yes ,  they don't use that in Mexico
aha
I mean it hasn't happened as strong as in these countries
aha
But I don't know I say ,  the people in Mexico depends ,  if they're interested in politics and all that they talk about that
aha
but what I've seen is that the majority are a little ,  well
ah ,  I can't hear you too good
No ,  already better ,  no
no still like every other word comes
ah ,  is that my phone doesn't have very good reception here but , 
it's a little bit better now
yes I was saying that in Mexico there's not that much but that not many people talk about that anyways because they worry more about working and just being healthy and all that
aha
but instead of talking ,  but I think that is a little more although Mexico is kind of conservative in the sense of the moral and the family and how to live and all . 
mm
generally I think they tend to be a little more liberal
mm
I mean is not like here ,  that you see that the liberals have an idea of the economy ,  well ,  a different idea of how to do things that ,  that are totally different
aha aha
yes they all have similar ideas And there it goes ,  and then I don't know perhaps that makes things a little bit harder for me
similar But also here it looks a little either you are of one side or you're from another . 
yes
I stand in the middle and that's a little complicated because nobody ,  nobody likes extremes .  I mean I couldn't choose just one extreme . 
mm
then I don't know But if you want let's change topic ,  we can talk about whatever something you do like to talk about
eh ,  eh ,  like what ? 
um ,  I don't know what does your husband do ,  for example
eh ,  he works ,  for the justice department ,  he works in a prison . 
ah ,  really
yes and he
that must be hard ,  and how long have you been married ? 
is    eh thirteen or fourteen years
ah ,  seriously
mm
wow that's a lot that's great ,  congratulations also
thanks ,  And how do you like the United States ? 
yes I like it eh ,  I've found somethings that I don't
Like what ? 
but in general I'm liking it like eh ,  the society seems very different for example when I go out to dance and all that
mm
I do not like dancing here ,  the atmosphere makes it inappropriate
it not fun and easy as in Mexico
mhm
I don´t like hanging out with friends who are not Latinos
okay
they are different from other people who usually do not like what they do but I like to work
I like to see how the world works
yes
you live well ,  you have opportunities ,  but I am not used to it
yes
although the more you work things are not going to get better
mhm
here the difference is if you want to have more you can actually do it
mhm
so I just want to be here and make my life here
for what ? 
because it is good to know that there are opportunities
there is also a lot of fear in the society by terrorism
mhm
also having all these international problems do not make me feel comfortable
Uh huh
And besides ,  I'm not american ,  so it's even harder to me
Yes
to get used to that
¿And how much time do you have left ? 
To finish ?  ,  i don't know ,  it must be like ,  i hope two years
Right
But maybe I'll take a little bit more because i want to do a couple minors to .  .  and i don't know ,  let's see ,  ad i don't know ,  working ,  or i also have to wait
or if i better go to another country ,  it all depends ,  [it's not] just about the money
Hello ,  i can't ,  i can't hear you again
Right ,  no ,  that ,  here the ones who have money are below and i think i want to live
right
Hello ,  hi . 
Hello ,  hi .   Eh ,  who is this ? 
Don't tell me it's Miguel Angel . 
Hello ,  Fina .   How are you ? 
How great ,  no ? 
How nice .   I'm very happy to be able to talk with you . 
Yeah ,  I recognized your voice ,  yes .   How are you ?   You know that I lost your telephone number .   I was
yes . 
My god ,   but yes ,  I left it here .   So  So it finally showed up ,  and
Wow ,  Ah ,  yes . 
and ,  after I was about to call you ,  but this week has been crazy . 
Me too ,  I've had a lot of work ,  well ,  it called me ,  this Fisher machine called me ,  the one that speaks normally ,  and
And I didn't hear anything they asked . 
nothing ,  nothing .   And ,  and I couldn't even answer .  Because ,  I tell you that I had a week ,  also ,  incredible week of work .   You know ? 
yes ,  Right ?   So ,  so you're studying really hard . 
Hmm .   Yes because I spent all day in the laboratory .   You know ? 
Aha . 
yes ,  when the reaction works out ,  it works out .   But when it doesn't work out ,  you have to be there ,  eh ,  you know so ,  well . 
And how ,  how did your plans work out ,  your hypothesis ,  your theory ,  your , 
So , 
your experiments
Well ,  well ,  at the moment .  at the moment it is going well ,  what happens ,  is that ,  of course ,  it requires much work ,  because everything ,  eh ,  are new things ,  all are reactions ,  new products
nobody has done before .  Do you know ?  then ,  lets say
Oh ,  but how clever . 
you go as a pioneer right ?  for the life . 
I congratulate you because you have ,  maybe ,  a very good future . 
Man ,  of course ,  see it ,  of the future I know ,  but ,  but at work ,  the present is very good because ,  because I do what I like most ,  and ,  and to me ,  it is something very interesting . 
And ,  you get things that you are waiting to come , 
Of course . 
and so .  Oh boy ,  well ,  fantastic ,  I don´t  I don´t
Of course ,  it is true . 
I have not done very much ,  because I live with my dad .  Do you see it ?  He ,  he is very old .  Then , 
Aha ,  aha . 
I practically am who takes care of him and
Of course .  So that ,  you have double job ,  out of home and at home ,  of course
but besides ,  I work .  And at home ,  and then ,  well ,  when he arrives ,  I talk to him ,  and see a television program ,  you know .  And and if a thing
Of course ,  of course ,  yes ,  and Is your father ,  is you father ,  so ,  is he fine ,  so ,  do you take care of him because he is sick ? 
He has ,  memory problems . 
Ah ,  yeah . 
but ,  however ,  he is alone all the ,  all the ,  practically . 
Poor him ,  poor him . 
And then ,  I call him every now and then ,  and I'm at least ,  I'm an agitation ,  with the people that come tomorrow from repair . 
Sure . 
They are going to put new windows in all the ,  in this apartment ,  and ,  and everything has been
Ah ,  to put windows ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  Because you ,  you live here in ,  in Philadelphia in the city ,  or you live outside ? 
yes ,  yes ,  in ,  in ,  Is a street that's more to the northeast Right ? 
Mm ,  Northeast ? 
Six ,  nine ,  six ,  nine ,  zero ,  six
Okay ,  I'm not ,  I'm not in the same one ,  but yes . 
that is like the sun ,  rising sun .  Right ? 
Okay ,  okay . 
Um ,  is an apartment ,  but it has , 
Mm . 
mm ,  quite a few years ,  and I like the location ,  because of that ,  that my dad is calm here ,  no , 
Aha .  Sure .  Well ,  but ,  but he can manage on his own ,  I mean ,  you don't have to . 
the place is peaceful .  No ,  he does everything ,  he makes his , 
He can walk and he can eat and , 
no ,  he does everything except the  I come and make the food .  I mean that ,  right now I finished so he can eat . 
Sure .  Sure .  And besides the food ,  is important that he doesn't make it ,  because he has memory problems ,  you know what happens right ?  well ,  you are a psychologist ,  you know . 
But ,  okay Mm . 
Who leave the fire on
yes .  And since he is intelligent ,  he hasn't wanted
It can cause a fire ,  of course
He doesn't do anything himself ,  it must be because he knows it ,  right ? 
Sure ,  he knows he has memory lapses
since the doctor talked to him  ,  yes ,  oh
And ,  how old is your father ? 
Ninety two
Wow .  Congratulations ,  be happy he is still alive
Thank you ,  yes .  I
Congratulations ,  congratulations ,  how good . 
Amen .  My mother died five years ago
Aha
And then
Did your mother die old also ? 
she was seventy nine when she died
Well ,  well ,  no ,  well ,  yes ,  well ,  but
Forty eight .  He is about ten years older than her
I see ,  I see
Oh ,  mm ,  eh ,  so ,  I say that ,  well ,  I am thinking of putting him a person ,  right ?  I mean ,  putting him a
Sure ,  sure ,  maybe a person ,  or
even if it's for an hour .  But ,  is that he is the one that doesn't want to . 
okay .  But .  You know what happens ?  that the ,  the people look ,  I'm going to tell you a case which is very similar to yours , 
Aha . 
and is of my grandmother .  My grandmother is eighty nine years old . 
if  if we get disconnected I'll call you ,  aha ,  aha
Okay ,  okay ,  well ,  look ,  my grandmother is eighty nine years old . 
Mm . 
And ,  the same .  She was ,  well ,  like ,  like your dad ,  that I don't want anyone ,  that I'm happy alone ,  that I don't know this ,  that I don't know that . 
But ,  but ,  this past summer ,  I don't know if I told you ,  but she was very ill and we thought that already it didn't ,  didn't count it you know ?  Because ,  she stopped eating ,  already
Okay
no ,  she was dehydrated .  Well ,  well ,  that she was already going , 
Ah ,  my God .  How old ,  how old was she ,  sorry ?  That you didn't tell me . 
eighty nine ,  she's eighty nine . 
Ah . 
And ,  and well ,  and like that Right ?  The thing is that my mom ,  of course ,  she couldn't be in the house anymore , 
Ah . 
because ,  because is that ,  a person that you already have to feed ,  that you already have to do everything to , 
They would get into trouble . 
but she didn't want to ,  she didn't want to .  And that if you take me somewhere ,  I'll throw myself out the window ,  well ,  I mean ,  making a drama
Aha
doing big drama ,  how good , 
yes
And ,  now she has taken her to a residence ,  where she is enjoying
Oh
they treat her like a queen
Oh ,  what a luck
And ,  ah ,  and she spent the first week crying ,  where have you put me ?  but now she is enjoying it ,  she doesn't want to leave
Oh ,  so happy
Old people ,  you know what is their problem ?  they are very reluctant to such things ,  but afterwards ,  once they are in ,  they enjoy it
I tell you because
I tell you
if you think that your father will be better in the company of someone ,  stop thinking about it and do it .  Because in the beginning he won't like it ,  and will make some drama
I die
But then ,  then ,  he'll thank you
Mhm
Because being alone all day long ,  that's not good .  Because ,  being alone ,  no ,  it's much better being with somebody ,  or somewhere ,  you know ? 
Well ,  so far ,  thanks God ,  I have been alright in this ,  and I get apid
Sure ,  sure
I even get paid to take care of him .  There are a lot of things here
Ah ,  look ,  very good . 
yes ,  they give me ,  like a quantity ,  an allocation ,  a little bit . 
Like some help ,  a subsidy ,  no ? 
yes ,  so he can be with me and that .   So , 
Ah ,  how nice .   How nice . 
what I need ,  since he's still whole ,  that he put ,  that he gets his clothes ,  he fixes himself ,  he bathes himself ,  he
Ah ,  good .   Very good ,  very good . 
I say that ,  so well ,  while he can .   But ,  in time . 
Sure . 
Well ,  the thing is good ,  after no
Sure ,  or ,  or at best ,  I don't know ,  this time ,  I imagine that there will be ,  in Spain there's something called Day Centers , 
Ah . 
that are ,  senior citizen residences ,  but they're ,  sure . 
yes .   Exactly .   He didn't want it because he doesn't speak English .   It's also the language so 
They're places where ,  ah ,  he doesn't speak English ,  sure ,  sure ,  sure . 
So ,  he doesn't want to because if he gets lost ,  because they'll come to look for him and everything .   No ? 
Yeah ,  yeah . 
And they take him and they bring him .   But ,  so , 
They take him and they bring him ,  sure . 
but the chauffeur doesn't speak Spanish ,  the chauffeur ,  so he says ,  and if I don't
yes ,  really ?  Listen ,  and there isn't something ,  there isn't something ,  there isn't one of these day centers that speak Spanish ?  There isn't ?  For the Spanish speaking community . 
There in the center .  There are places that speak Spanish ,  the inside ones . 
Sure ,  because I think there has to be ,  eh ,  there has to be . 
But the transportation no ,  well ,  I would have to see if I can take him myself . 
Okay , 
Is what I was thinking of doing next ,  being with him ,  there a while with that , 
Mm .  Sure . 
Also take him with the 
You take him ,  and stay with him one day ,  so he sees that you are not abandoning him . 
yes . 
And ,  then ,  well , 
And that the people see ,  and that he talks
that the people see you ,  you stay with him a while ,  and like that ,  at the end ,  he will ask you for it .  At the end ,  he will be the one who will tell you ,  Fina , 
Because
take me to the place ,  that here in the house I get bored ,  you'll see . 
Oh ,  yes ,  Then ,  my mom ,  eh ,  also got me a little  because when they got here ,  I would say ,  she would tell him ,  Josefina is going to put is in a
in a home ,  here they call it a home .  A nursing home . 
Ah ,  in a home a nursing home ,  yes . 
And ,  then , 
No ,  but no ,  but
I would tell her ,  but mom ,  Why do you tell me that ? 
 . 
Ah ? 
No ,  that is that ,  a company ,  excuse me ,  they are asking me something . 
Ah ,  sorry .  Okay .  Then ,  my mom would tell him like that ,  and now he stayed with the idea that I'm going to leave him alone somewhere and
No ,  God ,  no . 
she has him traumati well ,  they were both like that with that fear .  And ,  me no ,  ah ,  I say ,  how that you are going But ,  that ,  of doing it ,  would be a fabulous thing that ,  that he would love .  Right ? 
Sure ,  if at the end then ,  sure ,  that at the end he gets used to it and he will ask you for it ,  you'll see . 
Ah . 
So ,  at first yes
He's told me like that ,  and that leave me in a hospital ,  he tells me .  Take me to a hospital .  Because sometimes ,  I stay out a little longer and that .  Then , 
Okay ,  okay
he tell me ,  that ,  I'm a nuisance for you ,  that I don't know   ah ,  my God ,  is a drama . 
Ah ,  the elderly people ,  really ,  eh .  That ,  that ,  become like small children . 
And ,  and us that can , 
Right ? 
yes ,  I don't want to torture him either . 
The people eh ,  no ,  But ,  is not torturing him ,  but it's for his own good .  What happens is that the elderly people ,  become like small children . 
Mm . 
They become very dependent .  They become yes ,  I mean ,  they are very old ,  but they become like babies . 
Like ,  yes ,  to , 
Like babies . 
like he's scared . 
Ah ,  is a ,  is a ,  is a regression ,  yes ,  yes .  My grandmother ,  the same .  My mom went on vacation this summer ,  and well ,  and you're leaving ,  you're leaving me alone , 
what value does that have ,  I mean that ,  my mom had been without a vacation ,  two years already .  You know ? 
Aha .  Oh ,  Can you imagine ? 
I mean that ,  they are very ,  are very tyrannical ,  they blackmail you a lot .  I mean that no ,  eh ,  not the

But yes .  But ,  I'm always the smallest ,  sure . 
You are young ,  yes ,  still .

Ah .  Eh ,  I think that yes ,  they are the ones in first year . 
You see them very young ,  yes ,  the ones in first year .  And ,  you see them so young ,  so young .

In Clinical Psychology ,  imagine now ,  right ? 
And you told me that the ,  the PhD is not so ,  ¿how's that ?  ,  like the masters where you have to study a lot ,  but
Yes ,  the PhD is more about doing your own research
It's something else
I mean ,  it's more ,  a more creative process ,  ¿right ? 
Uh huh ,  yeah ,  and doing the ,  a thesis ,  ¿right ?  ,  it's a
Study more ,  sure ,  the thesis ,  the thesis
Oh ,  and ¿is it just you or are you doing it with someone else ? 
I'm doing it ,  i mean ,  it's my own ,  i have my own project ,  but well ,  I'm here .  I work with other people researching ,  ¿you know ?  ,  but my ,  my project is mine .  I mean ,  no ,  no one else is doing it .  I mean ,  it's an original research
¿And on what year will you finish it ?

Look ,  is is  MVLAS , 
 MV of ,   V of cow ? 
no ,   B of donkey . 
um e 
Good evening ,  I'm Joe
Hello ,  this is Patrick
I had the feeling that they were going to put us together again . 
yes
How is  how was your day ,  how did it go ? 
Good ,  well ,  it ,  it's Friday ,  and we are eating pizza in my p  ,  parents house
Ah ,  that's sgood
yes .  And you ? 
Is it pretty down there ? 
yes ,  yes ,  the weather ,  today was very ,  very ,  very good . 
And here it was warm ans shinny .  And well ,  I'm alone ,  but ,  also ,  I went out to eat ,  so ,  I'm very happy .  The I was watching television right now ,  to see what's going on . 
yes
Well ,  what else ,  we'll talk about politics ,  ah ? 
yes ,  well ,  what else can we talk about ? 
Patrick ? 
Ay ,  I don't know ,  let's see ,  ah
Well I know that ,  well ,  they show in television of ,  something about ,  political changes ,  um .  I know what they are doing ,  there is a republican guy
that made pejorative comments about black race .  So ,  has been criticised a lot .  He is ,  I think he has a radio show .  o I think that the ,  the president said something about that he didn't want , 
Oh ,  hm . 
So ,  the White House was not involved in his comments ,  or something like that
Hmm . 
yes ,  it seems that there were some commentators who say that the best way to reduce crime is for black families to abort their kids .   Like ,  to not have , 
those who are going to have kids ,  that they abort them ,  and then crime will be reduced .   Pretty stupid commentary . 
yes . 
I think that it was cited in a book ,  or something like that
Psh
Well yes ,  this is like ,  but was it last night we talked ? 
yes . 
Eh ,  I still think that there should be more parties because in reality ,  republican and democrat don't give their time ,  aunt with the ball ,  as we say there in Puerto Rico . 
No ,  really it's that they have so much dominance ,  that in reality ,  they're really relaxed in the ways that they manage their issues .   like ,  that they don't catch with , 
with the seriousness and the dedication that they should give it .   So what they do is open a big path to corruption . 
yes ,  yes . 
Well ,  it's something that I dislike a lot .   At the same time they were talking in the news about all the people who died in Iraq this week . 
yes . 
Among them sixteen Americans and more than two hundred Iraqis . 
yes ,  yes
Like ,  this issue of the war keeps being a really sad issue ,  and how they say in English ,  uh ,  well ,  for president ,  because in reality
they're letting him continue to do this . 
yes ,  it's very bad . 
Well ,  so the
yes .  I think ,  I think that they should put p  ,  like a ,  a ,  one of the rules that must change is the
that the ,  the parties ,  we can't receive um ,  money ,  from ,  from the ,  from the big companies ,  or the
Oh yes
the um ,  yes ,  the
yes ,  I agree ,  because a long time ago that big company is like they have a lot of influence eh ,  true ,  some ,  well ,  leaders ,  or some congressmen ,  whatever it is ,  well they favor some laws
yes
or they are against
They do laws to ,  to be convenient to ,  to ,  to the ,  the ,  the big companies . 
As in the past there was a lot of pollution y a lot of politicians knew that the companies were throwing out ans still do it but not at a great scale as before ,  that
they disposed of the contaminated products ,  the eh
yes
waste like they say in English ,  they throw it out in areas that could affect the community
yes
In fact here in Colorado there are several areas that underground ,  well ,  well ,  well they pollute the water ,  that's because ,  of the things they buried that
they was a lot ,  even radioactivity too . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  here is my daughter Ivonne
yes ,  she is talking
yes
And now I was talking with my girl also .  Are you with your mom today ? 
Ah ,  okay ,  yes ,  ay ,  I ,  I have her on Thursdays . 
yes
Fridays and Saturdays ,  and half of the Sundays
yes ,  all of the week ? 
More or less ,  no ,   half of the week .  Thursday ,  Thursday to
I mean ,  do you have the same schedule every week ?  Thursday to .  . 
yes ,  every week ,  yes
Friday ?  Oh that's cool
yes ,  yes
And mine stays with me on Tuesdays ,  Thursdays and sometimes from Friday to Saturday or from Saturday to Sunday
That's fine
I mean ,  but it's always three times a week
Oh ,  that's fine
yes ,  I enjoy a lot the company of my little daughter .  Do you have only one ,  Patrick ? 
yes ,  just one
yes .  How old is she ? 
Five years ? 
Oh ,  oh yes ,  just like mine ,  right .  But you are younger than me ,  aren't you Patrick ?  How old are you ? 
I am twenty six ,  twenty seven years old
Twenty seven .  I am twenty years older than you .  I am forty . seven .  I had my daughter when I was already old .  But my girl fills me with energy .  She is my inspiration ,  actually
Well ,  yes ,  yes
The mo mother of hers is from Mexico ,  and she's very young .  It's like also is relatively young ,  she's like twenty five years old .  yes . 
That's good . 
We get along well in the sense of be  being like parents right .  We don't get along as spouses but we get along well like ,  like parents of the girl .  We work well together . 
Ah yes ,  yes su  That's ,  that's good like that .  That's how it should be ,  yes ,  if not it would be , 
yes . 
um ,  husbands ,  or spouses no . 
yes
Oh ,  mm . 
And as a result of that the girl is happy . 
At least ha 
Because even though she would like ,  it's true that she would like to see us both together again , 
yes . 
but at least she's happy that ,  the ,  the parents get along well ,  and that we treat her with lots of love ,  and there's no discord in front of her
That's right . 
because that would affect her a lot . 
yes . 
I have seen that a lot in other ,  ah , 
yes . 
people and I have seen how it has affected the children ,  and I no I have never wanted that to happen to my little girl . 
yes ,  that specially in houses
yes
but
and they are well
seasoned . 
they have great perception of what happens . 
yes . 
That my daughter is very conscious of what is happening around her .  And she knows if something is bad ,  if there is something sad ,  someone is angry ,  she always knows . 
yes ,  yes .  yes ,  it's like they have a ,  a ,  sixth sense at ,  at times . 
yes ,  yes .  And thanks to that ,  well ,  I always keep ,  it helps keep her mom and me well balanced in the ,  in the in the dealing with
or at least in front of her ,  so that it does not affect her .  Because we are very conscious as well that if ,  say ,  we have some discord ,  we begin to discuss that in front of her ,  well ,  it will affect
the little girl . 
yes .  yes . 
But speaking of this and the laws it's true ,  this ,  this has lots to do with the parties ,  how they greatly discriminate against us ,  the ,  the fathers in regard to things because
my ex wife makes more money than I ,  and ,  in reality ,  and I worked very hard for my house and when I gave it ,  I'm paying this ,  child support and
and ,  well ,  this ,  the residence is with ,  eh ,  her mom ,  not me ,  even though she is still her mother ,  she got it because they always discriminate more ,  oh ,  the most important question that I was going to talk about is on taxes ,  that
she claims two years and I claim the third year . 
Ahk . 
That this ,  this always affects me a great deal . 
yes ,  yes yes . 
You know all the expenses that one
discriminate no ,  a little ,  I suppose , 
yes ,  they discriminate a lot against men .  And it's true that there's a bunch of scoundrels ah by there ,  but the laws discriminate a lot against the men . 
Well here in Colorado they are quite tough .  When things like that come ,  almost all the friends that I know who have ended up in divorce the fathers have been
very unfortunate and have for example ,  a ,  like my brother that his kids every other weekend
Ah . 
I mean ,  instead of like that like me ,  yes . 
Well ,  is good . 
But ,  nothing . 
And yes .  They are ,  the good thing is that you do have like three days a week ,  and
And yes I enjoy that a lot ,  I would love to have her every day . 
yes I ,  I
But I have to accept it and be satisfied so and ,  help the girl understand that I fully enjoy her company those three days also . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes .  And
And since the girl is growing up eh .  Do you and your ex wife get along well ? 
yes ,  yes ,  we get along well ,  um Well ,  at first ,  there were some problems no .  But , 
yes .  Yes for us too
right now it's
but it changed a lot .  Here the situation improved a lot . 
yes ,  yes ,  already ,  already we
yes
we understand us better and and ,  ah ,  well ,  our first thing is to take care of her ,  our
Of course ,  of course .  Have you married again Patrick ? 
What ? 
Did you married again ,  or ? 
Who ? 
You ,  you .  After the divorce ,  did you found someone ? 
Um ,  no ,  she goes out with some ,  sometimes she has boyfriends ,  but never have been like that . 
Oh . 
Well I ,  I ,  I do have a girlfriend we have been together for five months right now . 
Oh yes ? 
And ,  I like her a lot ,  and
How good . 
we get along very well right now . 
How nice .  That is good . 
And she is
yes ,  to me it has been difficult to have a relationship after that because eh ,  this was my second divorce .  The first one was ah ,  when I was very young but I stayed married almost ten years . 
Ah . 
And ,  well ,  it is like you don´t feel the desire to get married again . 
yes ,  it is very difficult . 
yes ,  it is very difficult 
And ,  and ,  and we have been married for three years
¿Yes ? 
But this ,  i mean ,  with the one I'm with now
Yes
Uh ,  also has a daughter that's six years old and also ,  kinda ,  the same thing happened ,  ¿right ? 
Yes
So ,  it's like ,  we understand each other very well in that aspect ,  right ? 
that's good
of ,  of how things are and
¿Do you know her ?  ,  yes
and ,  i think ,  yes ,  yes ,  she's very cool and
That's good ,  that's good ,  when you find someone good like that and that you get along fine ,  and love each other very much ,  that's very important
Yes ,  and it's also ,  uh ,  she's also a good mom ,  luckily
That too ,  even more important
Because ,  uh ,  i see ,  i see ,  i see how she treats her daughter ,  and she treats her very good
She treats her baby well ,  the
yes ,  yes ,  very well
That's good
Good evening ,  from New York . 
Hello ,  eh ,  from New York too . 
Ah ,  which part of New York ? 
Eh ,  Manhattan . 
Oh ,  how good .  Are you Spanish ,  right ? 
yes ,  are you John ? 
yes ,  we talked last night .  Oh . 
yes ,  eh ,  we talked yesterday and  ,  we have to talk of the same thing
yes ,  I know ,  then ,  now I think that I know what are we going to do .  Ouch . 
yes ,  yes ,  the topic is , 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  today I was talking with my ,  my dad was here today and ,  and he was talking about ,  Spain because ,  like I told you yesterday ,  my grandparents are from Spain and
Uh hum . 
and well ,  he talked to me about ,  about about my parents who ,  his grandfather was from ,  his father was from Canary Island ,  etc so
I don´t know what ,  no ,  I don´t know so and what ,  how are you doing today ?  a very beautiful day ,  right ? 
Ah ,  eh ,  I have not go out from house yet
Oh ,  right ?  Ah ,  were you out until late last night ? 
No . 
No ? 
No ,  but I had to work ,  well to study and I have not gone out
Oh ,  yes ?  Oh ,  And what do you work in ? 
Study . 
Ah ,  ah ,  you are studying .  yes ,  well that's what you had told me in Colombia right ? 
Uh um yes . 
Ah ,  wow .  Wow .  Well ,  then ,  how do we talk about the topic today ?  Because the truth is that is going to be hard I already think that yesterday we covered it
What already had to be said . 
almost everything
Well ,  yes ,  well I have a question ,  you
Tell me . 
think there should be more parties ?  Would you like it if there were other parties ? 
Um ,  well ,  yes ,  it wouldn't be a bad idea eh ,  have one but there have been parties the only thing that just that the parties eh ,  the other parties there have been ,  have no strength at all
yes . 
But there are other parties ,  there's the liberal party ,  there's well eh ,  other small parties . 
yes ,  but ,  uh ,  do you like the other parties ,  better ,  ,  than the bigger ones ? 
No the truth is that the politic is so is so hard ,  right ? 
Um . 
that ,  well at least the possibility of choosing one or another that has ideas ,  eh ,  eh ,  obviously is better than having a
Dictator ,  oh ,  yes . 
a dictator right ?  that is what he says and there's no opinion at all I mean ,  but like we were talking yesterday ,  the ,  the parties are more or less the same ,  they have similar ideas
one want to cut a little more ,  others want to cut a little less and and well ,  so
yes ,  the good thing that the democracy has perhaps is that if something really is bad for ,  eh ,  ah ,  ah ,  uh ,  the people ,  they really don't like it
Uhum . 
always ways from ,  to avoid it ,  it's really bad . 
yes . 
With a dictator you can't ,  a dictator
Uhum . 
he has ,  oh ,  the army and the strength to do what he likes . 
Exactly . 
That's the only difference maybe ,  besides that ,  the government do what they like . 
yes . 
It's really bad . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  for example ,  the mayor here ,  he did something that I really didn't like because and you know ,  you have your freedom and you can live your
life as you want but he took away the freedom of the people because they can't smoke in the restaurants . 
Um . 
And I don't smoke ,  no ? 
No . 
But ,  I think that they do have a separate area in which the ones that like to smoke ,  they can do it ,  I think that obviously ,  I don't like it when they are in the other table and you are and I
oh ,  I just started eating and it is over and they are smoking and they are blowing the smoke ,  the smoke right at your face . 
yes ,  that's wrong . 
when I'm eating ,  you know ?  But ,  yes ,  in general ,  if they choose a place in the restaurant and they go ,  this part
you can smoke but well then ,  smoke ,  and the bars too ,  there's a bar in which ,  everyone is smoking so I had to
the smoke bothers you ,  well you go since there are so many bars in ,  in New York ,  well if you don't like
Hum .   Sure but what happens is that you're if your friends smoke ,  then
yes ,  well also . 
you can't go out with them ,  or you have to put up with the smoke
Exactly ,  yes ,  exactly .   So but he ,  he yeah ,  for me what happened is it passed the line to insist that people can't ,  can't smoke . 
But I think that ,  if I choose this it because I want people to permanently stop smoking ,  because it's bad for their health . 
Well yes ,  but it's bad for the ,  the ,  the health ,  I agree but so ,  eh ,  if we're going to start there ,  how many other things are bad for the health ,  so are we going to start to
to take them from people all the vices that there are in the world that are bad for you ?   Drinking is also bad for you ,  if you drink in excess ,  no ? 
yes . 
So what ,  what's the next thing to do ?   Not let people drink . 
No ,  sure ,  there are some ,  from this place there are many things in the
You know . 
life that are bad and you can't prohibit everything . 
yes . 
but the same with the drugs that are very bad . 
yes . 
They're prohibited
yes . 
That even if this part was allowed ,  it would be the same to me because I don't take them . 
yes . 
But just as the drugs are prohibited ,  the cigarette is almost as bad as the drugs
yes . 
is not like the alcohol .  The alcohol if you drink it in moderation well it does very little harm .  The cigarette even if you take it in moderation is bad . 
yes . 
Then ,  to me it doesn't seem so bad .  I mean ,  I understand that the people that smoke that is ,  they can't is very hard to get rid of the cigarette addiction
yes
for them is a big ,  a ,  a ,  a big inconvenience that you can't smoke in the places
Uh um . 
but if this will promote that the people each time smoke less and that the young people don't smoke who they are always
is when the people start ,  when they are young and don't have the judgement still well
Well ,  yes
formed ,  they start to smoke and then they can't they can't quit smoking . 
yes . 
I don't find it so bad . 
yes ,  but ,  but remember that that's also chosen by
Or if not
by the young people ,  because I was raised with all the ,  the friends around me that smoked . 
Um . 
No ,  no ,  I didn't like it .  From the start I didn't like it ,  I never liked the habit and I didn't get it .  And ,  my sister who also
who is young also ,  she's twenty four years old has never smoked either ,  and doesn't drink either ,  she doesn't like alcohol . 
Uh huh . 
Well ,  I
But it's a minority ,  it's few people ,  at this age everyone wants to be a ,  uh ,  I don't know ,  have friends ,  and be the most important
and the ,  and so they have to smoke because this makes them feel older ,  few resist this ,  those who
Uh huh . 
don't call attention ,  don't have enough personality to say I don't need to smoke
yes ,  yes . 
So I don't know .   It's a complex problem but
Uh huh . 
something that they've proved is bad ,  doesn't seem bad to me ,  more than anything for me is whe  the restaurants ,  well ,  tobacco never bothered me too much ,  but in the
bars ,  at night
Uh huh . 
in Spain ,  people smoke so much
I know .   No ,  in Spain ,  I know that sometimes
you get out of there with your skin smelling like tobacco ,  clothes smelling like tobacco ,  like ,  eh
yes . 
you don't smoke ,  and you've smoked like ,  as if you were addicted to tobacco . 
Exactly .   Yes ,  no ,  I remember .   The times when I was in Spain ,  this was something that
And this seemed really bad to me . 
was incredible how ,  how they smoke in Spain ,  and how they smoke in Europe . 
yes ,  yes . 
No ?  Eh ,  so But ,  eh ,  anyway eh ,  I ,  I think that they should ,  also should have their decision of where ,  where they can smoke , that there should be their
restaurants or there should be bars where they say ,  well okay ,  in these bars you can smoke ,  right ?  Or they have a space to smoke . 
Um , 
Because they also have rights too ,  if ,  if they want to die ,  well but one dies in they way that one wants .  Whether ,  whether is drinking or whether is
Okay .  But the bad thing is that it affects the rest ,  is that is not just him but also the
yes ,  yes .  No I understand .  I know that's why ,  that's why they put the law . 
That's the problem .  Sure . 
Right ?  But ,  I think that's already a little too much because
But the people that smoke complain too much ,  because I ah ,  I don't know how long you've been here but the people ,  I see ,  ah that they accept it
quite well ,  you always see in the bars even in the winter ,  the people smoking outside
yes ,  aha . 
and it doesn't seem to bother them too much ,  it doesn't seem like it
yes ,  yes but like , 
I don't know
yes ,  but like you ,  like I told you is one of those things of ,  of the politics that I think has already crossed the line ,  right ? 
yes . 
That ,  at least in finding a way to accommodate them ,  eh in ,  in ,  in some way .  Which ,  which is what we had before that
there was a section in the ,  in the restaurant where one could smoke . 
Um . 
And that didn't actually affect you ,  advices did ,  it was something pe  ,  planes did ,  I can understand
plane because the air
Of course you
flows ,  the everybody was smelling it
yes
So ,  but I don't know
No ,  the planes ,  I makes me sad because for instance a flight to Europe ,  to Spain ,  or from Europe to America
Uhum
takes many hours ,  and for the nonsmokers it must be a torture ,  if flying is bad already ,  a flight is a torture to everybody
yes
if in addition you have to smoke and can't
Uhum ,  uhum
it must be even worse
No ,  they get out of the plane with the nerves at one thousand
yes
I see .  Wow ,  Hum
But anyway ,  and ,  I don't know ,  don't you ever think of founding your own party when you see the politicians doing it all so bad ? 
Oh ,  eh ,  look ,  eh ,  ah ,  I don't like it specially in this country ,  eh , m  I never messed with politics because ,  eh ,  the press ,  the press I really don't like here because they can't
hold back
Um
and they start airing all the dirty laundry because they think that they are acting with interest Who were you sleeping with before ?  What did you smoke ,  didn't smoke
yes . 
and well ,  that honestly that to me ,  if I become a politician I want them to judge me
For what I do in the politics ,  and not for your private life ,  right ? 
No ?  Exactly ,  for ,  for my ability to carry the country or carry the state eh ,  my experience
Sure . 
but not what I do in ,  in ,  in my private life ,  that for me
But you don't think that perhaps is not so much I don't know the media ,  but rather the others ,  the opposition and the other parties who are interested
in getting that out
Both ,  because the press here also eh ,  has divided in ,  in a press of ,  of democrats and of republican press . 
Uh um . 
So Fox for example is ,  they lean to the right and the New York Times ,  leans to the left .  Right ?  Then you are reading
eh ,  from the point of view of ,  of the left or the right .  And ,  the press should be ,  um ,  must be neutral .  Right ?  Report
Okay . 
the events how they are not from a ,  from a political point of view ,  of the left or the right and they don't ,  and is not what they do . 
The New York Times ,  channel twelve ,   CBS are ,  they lean a lot to the left right ?  eh ,  they fired that guy ,  Dan Rather who was
the most important for many years who was in CBS like in ,  in ,  in the nightly news they fired him because they tried to get out eh ,  before ,  a few weeks before Bush's election
they tried to come out with a report that was fabricated ,  eh
Hi
Good afternoon ,  Mildred from Connecticut
Hi ,  good afternoon ,  I'm Miguel Angel ,  ¿what's your name ,  what did you say your name was
Mildred
Oh ,  Mildred ,  right
I live in Connecticut
In Connecticut ,  oh ,  very well ,  my name is Miguel Angel ,  I'm here in Philadelphia
Right ,  OK
Yes , 
¿How's everything there ,  good ? 
Good ,  very good .  We have a great day ,  sunny ,  and a little hot too ,  uh huh
Oh ,  it's cold here
Yes ,  it's ,  sure ,  you're further north .  Very well ,  where ,  ¿where are you from ,  where are you from ,  Mildred ? 
It's starting to .  .  .  Puerto Rican
From Puerto Rico ,  uh huh ,  I'm from Spain
Right ,  oh ,  yeah ,  that's good ,  ¿how many years have you been there ? 
Yes ,  yes ,  well ,  just a year .  Uh huh ,  just one year ,  I'm studying here ,  so ,  i'm doing a doctorate ,  ¿you know ? 
¿In what ? 
In Chemistry ,  uh huh
Oh ,  in Chemistry ,  wow
yes ,  yes . 
You are going to earn good money . 
Ah ,  we will see .  You never know .  And what do you do ? 
And ,  do you participate into politics ?  I am ,  I am not working now ,  but I work in a bank . 
Aha ,  aha . 
yes . 
Are you ,  are you sick leave ,  are you sick ,  or have you had a child ,  or ? 
No ,  I am resting ,  resting , no ,  look ,  my ,  my boyfriend is earning good money ,  so I don´t need to work now .  So
Oh ,  how good ,  how good .  How lucky ,  hear .  Some of you have luck ,  eh .  There are some with luck . 
I am just resting a little bit nothing more . 
That is good ,  very good .  How long have you been in the United States ? 
Yeah Here ,  almost eighteen years , 
Wow ,  wow . 
in the same place ,  living . 
yes ,  yes ,  well ,  that is a whole life ,  yeah ,  eh .  That is a whole life .  My brother has also been here for many years . 
So
My brother lives in New York . 
Oh . 
And ,  he has been ,  well ,  yes ,  like fifteen ,  fifteen ,  fourteen or fifteen years ,  too .  So ,  yes ,  he has been here for a long time ,  and that is what made me decide to come .  Do you know ? 
Ah ,  and do you vote ?  Are you a voter ,  or not ? 
But ,  I can' vote ,  no ,  no .  I don't have , 
Oh ,  that you are ,  this , 
no ,  I have a visa of , 
residency . 
student .  Right ?  I have a
Oh ,  student visa ,  oh ,  okay . 
a  J one a  J one ,  sure .  I can't ,  I can't vote ,  no .  It also wouldn't interest me to vote ,  because ,  honestly ,  how things are ,  so ,  you can . 
No ,  but yes ,  but exactly ,  because if you don't vote ,  things don't change . 
True ,  is ,  that's true ,  that's true .  That's true ,  certainly ,   it got me really mad ,  I don't know what your political ideology is ,  but , 
I got very mad that Bush was reelected again . 
Well ,  but ,  I don't find that he's done a bad job .  What happens is that ,  in many things ,  you know ,  each ,  each ,  how do you say it ?  each leader that is chosen ,  if he doesn't ,  if he doesn't work with all from his party ,  things don't come out too good . 
Sure ,  sure . 
Understand ?  And ,  there are more ,  I think that there are more republicans in ,  in the
yes . 
I don't know if in the senate or the chamber . 
Mm . 
and ,  well ,  the laws ,  is not the same ,  understand ,  that when all the democrats are in power , 
yes . 
well ,  the laws are passed faster ,  they help each other , 
Aha ,  aha . 
when you choose a leader who is working with groups that are not of their same party ,  is very hard . 
Sure ,  sure . 
Very hard ,  for you to be able to make decisions , 
mm . 
that they approve the decisions . 
Okay ,  I mean ,  Do yo say it because of the chamber ? 
So
But ,  now ,  there ,  the majority is republican .  Right ?  Or not ? 
Aha . 
I don't know ,  I don't know .  I ask . 
yes ,  yes . 
Now there's a republican majority .  And ,  you say that
Yeah aha . 
they take longer in appro  passing the laws ,  in approving the laws . 
Oh ,  yes ,  sure ,  sure ,  because they are all going to jump on top ,  on everything that he wants .  I mean , 
Okay . 
eh ,  if it was the democratic party ,  well ,  then ,  they agree ,  understand ?  no let's work ,  or let's find a way , 
And why ,  and why do you think ,  why do you think that is ,  why do you think that the democrats agree more than the republicans
Well ,  because is all ,  is all ,  is as if the republicans were in power ,  if the republicans are in power ,  and all the cabinet is republican , 
Okay . 
they will work together . 
Yeah ,  yeah . 
But ,  if you have from other parties ,  you will always fine ,  eh ,  an opposition ,  you know ?   It's ,  co ,  it's not ,  it's not only one thing . 
Sure ,  well ,  this is sure ,  yes .   I ,  it's true .   What ,  yes . 
It's like when you're studying or working ,  you're in a job , 
Hmm . 
and someone comes who enters after you , 
Hmm . 
who might have ,  well ,  a grade ,  higher ,  more education than you ,  nevertheless ,  doesn't know how to do the job like you because you've been there for many years . 
Sure ,  because he has more experience and spent more time ,  sure . 
Exactly ,  Aha ,  you already have the experience ,  you've spent more time there .   But ,  this guy who came in new ,  only because he has a bigger title ,  they will give him a higher position than you ,  they will go above you ,  you know ? 
Hmm .  Yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah . 
Well ,  the same thing applies in politics . 
Hmm
For me ,  you know ?   I'm I'm a voter . 
yes . 
And ,  at the beginning I didn't vote because ,  but I realized that Hispanics need to count .   You know ?   It doesn't matter where we're from , 
yes ,  of course ,  sure .   Sure . 
whatever your country ,  wherever from . 
No ,  you are where you are ,  you have to have your voice ,  sure ,  of course . 
Exactly ,  you have to contribute ,  some grain you will contribute . 
Mm . 
And ,  if we don't get into the politics ,  they will never listen to us .  Understand ? 
No ,  of course ,  that ,  that is ,  that is super clear .  yes ,  no ,  in Spain I ,  I in
They have us limited .  Then ,  they will limit us even more . 
Okay ,  in Spain I ,  have always voted ,  I think ,  I ,  since ,  well ,  since I was able to vote at eighteen years old . 
Aha . 
I've always voted ,  we always went ,  I think ,  I seem to remember that I've always voted . 
Aha , 
I think that never ,  I've never ,  I've never abstained . 
I was like three years ,  that I was mad with that issue of the politics of ,  of ,  of the garbage of ,  of ,  that they would start ,  to govern ,  and ,  to make laws ,  and not give us benefits .  So
Okay ,  Okay . 
there were like three years that I stopped voting . 
Mm ,  mm
Understand ?  Then ,  later already ,  when I arrived here to the United States ,  well ,  as soon as I got here ,  I register to vote fast . 
Sure .  And now you can ,  sure . 
Because ,  here we need ,  especially us that are what they consider the minority ,  that we are not minority ,  because we are the majority . 
yes ,  well .  But , 
We are the biggest power ,  now ,  in all this nation . 
yes ,  yes .  But ,  well ,  sure . 
Because ,  here ,  without the Hispanic for the jobs , 
Hmm ,  hmm . 
they're not left with anyone ,  you know ? 
Yeah ,  yeah .   And do you think that ,  that the Republicans better defend the interests of the Hispanics than the democrats ? 
It depends on who has power ,  it depend on what roots they have .   You know ? 
Sure ,  aha ,  aha . 
Because ,  believe me ,  all ,  the people ,  don't support Bush .   But I think that Bush has given ,  Bush and Clinton , 
Hmm . 
for me ,  they've been two ,  and the other ,  Reagan , 
Aha . 
have been the two ,  hmm ,  those who participate the most and have given Hispanics in their cabinet . 
Yes ,  and they're from different parties ,  sure . 
And ,  aha ,  and they're from different parties .   Exactly .   This is why I tell you that depending on who it is and the roots that they have . 
Hmm .   Sure . 
In the Bush family there are Hispanic people . 
Hmm ,  hmm . 
Well ,  yes ,  I think it's ,  it's the brother in law or the sister in law are from Mexico ,  or something like that
yes .   yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
And ,  and ,  eh ,  I visited the ,  the white house .   You know the tour that they take you ,  in ,  in high school
Aha ,  yes ,  they take you ,  they take you to Washington ,  and , 
Aha .  Well ,  I was visiting it ,  and there were a lot of Hispanic there ,  working ,  when Clinton .  I went when Clinton
Mhm ,  aha
And ,  there were a lot of Hispanic working ,  in good positions ,  you know what I mean ? 
Mhm ,  mhm
Executive secretaries ,  office secretaries ,  there were many people
yes  , yes .  There are ,  now there are a lot of Hispanic in the responsibility places of the government ,  yes
That's why I tell you ,  because he ,  he has mixed with the Hispanic people .  You know what I mean ?  There are other leaders who have not given any chances ,  not to black people
I see
nor the Hispanic
The blacks ,  that sound funny
yes ,  yes . 
yes ,  the colorted people
yes ,  the Afric  ,  Afr  ,  how do they call them ?  mm
Afro American
Afro american ,  right
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
Wel ,  now ,  the ,  now the Afro American have ,  have had more chances than they had before
Right .  Look at Collin Powell ,  all what he has done
And they have been ,  aha ,  it has only been ,  I think ,  it has all been with these three leaders
Yes ,  yes ,  yes .  Well ,  it has been some years ,  if you add ,  if you add all the mandates of these leadres ,  it has been some years
yes
Because ,  Reagan was eight ,  right ? 
Aha ,  aha
And then there was Clinton ,  eight also ,  that makes sixteen .  And this one will soon make eight also .  So ,  it is twenty some years
yes ,  yeah
It's twenty five years of
And ,  why do you think they didn't change Bush ?  Why do you think that even the democrats voted for Bush ? 
well ,  I don't know ,  really I don't know ,  because I have been in this country for one year ,  and I don't have no idea
Because of the war
But ,  I think that ,  I think that
It was only because of the war .  Otherwise they have thrown him
I think that ,  precisely because of the war is why they should have thrown him
N  ,  eh ? 
That I think that because of the war they shouldn't have re elected him .  The problem is
No ,  no ,  but they can't ,  they can't because what a leader starts ,  he has to finish it
I see
You know what I mean ?  If they had put another person
I see ,  I see ,  already
let's suppose that things turn out wrong ,  who will be responsible for it ? 
Mh
To this new person who entered . 
Sure . 
You know ?   He has to finish what he started . 
Sure ,  sure .   Hmm ,  yes ,  what ,  to make sure ,  to make sure it's over .   Because , 
Because ,  if you notice how ,  how he was going to win ,  if the majority voted ,  the other times it was ,  you know ?   It was the republican ,  and he didn't win . 
Yeah .   Or ,  what we have to see is if he finishes it or doesn't finish it . 
Oh ,  yes ,  he'll finish it ,  he has to finish because ,  for better or worse ,  he has to finish . 
Yeah .   Yeah ,  yeah .   But ,  these things , 
And ,  yeah when ,  when this finishes ,  you'll see that they won't get it . 
these things ,  man ,  you can't get out ,  yeah ,  eh .   Like ,  you can't get out anymore because yeah ,  two legislatures . 
Aha . 
Like ,  even if ,  they don't want to show up .   Even if people wanted to vote for him ,  I don't k 
Well ,  I don't know ,  I don't know how it will be here in the United States .   But ,  in my country ,  we had a governor for twenty eight years .   All ,  eh ,  every four years the same ,  the same ,  the same . 
No . 
Twenty eight years in power . 
No ,  no .   Here in the States ,  no ,  no ,  no .   Here in the United States ,  no .   In the United States you can't have more than two terms .   Like ,  Clinton couldn't run anymore ,  and Reagan couldn't run anymore . 
No ,  if you lose or win ,  you can only be there for two terms ,  you can't be there longer . 
Aha .   yes ,  running ,  running . 
After there has to be another .   After ,  sure ,  after there has to be
Maybe I think that they can come back ,  because they can come back ,  I think that ,  how do you say ?   to
what can happen is that another party's candidate would advertise
okay
bush can not be more in power and has to go ,  so now another republican candidate can cover . 
the only thing they can do is appoint another candidate
okay ,  yes
so then ,  well , 
to represent
of course ,  it would be the only option for the Republican party to stay in power . 
now we have Bush Jr .  in office but he can no longer be there .  you know ? 
he has to finish everything left the war with Iraq
I hope the war ends soon .  .  . 
I think as soon as his term finishes there would be another candidate
Mm . 
the iraqis must have the power ,  and they can do whatever They want do
yes ,  that´s right . 
I will throw a bomb there too ,  and it would be over .  I would do as in Hiroshima .  because these people are bad . 
Mhm
these people are crazy
I do not agree with you ,  because I think it's a small group the one that does it . 
not all of them are like that ,  they only do it because they are indoctrinated . 
the image
no is that they are by their own belief .  Understand ? 
I don't agree .  I think that in the towns there's always a group of fanatic .  And ,  that the rest of the people are normal and good people ,  like in all areas . 
No ,  but this ,  this ,  this town ,  I think that they are all fanatics .  Because ,  if you look there ,  and you don't see a woman in the street .  When they show them ,  you don't see a single woman in the street . 
Mm . 
Because ,  there ,  the woman is not worth anything . 
yes ,  there's a lot ,  there's a lot of sexism ,  yes .  But ,  well ,  there's also sexism in other ,  in other communities .  And , 
Well ,  in all in all the Hispanic areas ,  there's sexism anywhere . 
Sure ,  there's also a lot of sexism in the Hispanic world . 
No ,  no ,  that ,  that one is rotten .

yes eh ,  twenty two months
Oh ,  I have I have a two years old one . 
oh ,  what is her name ? 
ah , 
oh
and yours
her name is Sara Rebeca Thanks
What is your nationality ? 
eh ,  I was born in Puerto Rico but ,  eh we moved here to Miami when I was five
aha
my parents are Dominicans ,  but the lady that raise me was Puerto Rican so I'm like a mix of both
um
so when they ask me I never know exactly how
You were born where ?  Oh ,  you're Puerto Rican
yes
Dominican Puerto Rican and and both
yes and and you ? 
aha Puerto Rican
ah how nice
What part in Puerto Rico ?  you don't remember
ah
What part in Puerto Rico ? 
eh ,  in Levitton it was where we lived for many years well until I was five
oh
And you ? 
I'm from Yaguco on my dad's side and from Cabrojo on my mom's side
aha
But I've never gone there
Oh yes
yes
wow
never ,  and have you returned there ? 
yes no ,  it's been like let me see probably like six years that I don't go ,  but before that I went every summer ,  I would spend the summers in Santo Domingo
No
Then eh from there we always would go to Puerto Rico and from Puerto Rico you know we would return
And are you married ? 
yes yes ,  from
With a Puerto Rican or Dominican ? 
no ,  with an American
or American . 
yes
he's in the Army the , 
ah
he's in the Army
No ,  no he is ,  he works with the department of justice
Oh
so ,  but
doing what ? 
he ,  he eh is guard of prisoners
Oh of counselor ,  okay no because almost all the women that talk in the survey are married with an American today are in the service .  No I ,  I also work in the police too
Oh yes
Yeah ,  with NYPD
wow
yeah
and how's that ,  that must be a tough job
uh ,  it's good ,  and it's fun if you do it when you're young
right
Because doing ,  like that ,  young ,  since I'm more than twenty two ,  i work in the street ,  regular clothes and all that
right
as a covert agent and that
Right
and i like it more than when i first started last year as a rookie ,  i was dressed in uniform but i have more fun now
and ,  your work schedule ,  ¿is it good or is it a little tough ? 
it depends ,  because as a covert it can change
Right
one week i might be here in an area ,  doing a ,  an hour ,  a different schedule ,  like that ,  it depends .  I wanted to do that ,  uh ,  correctional
Uh huh
what you do ,  your husband ,  i don't know ,  i wanted to be that ,  but
Uh huh
i liked being on the streets better
Yes he ,  he's not exactly a correctional officer her is more for recreation
yeah . 
he is ,  he ,  he
right . 
that's what he likes to do ,  the recreation but he's working with the department of
I don't understand the word in Spanish . 
recreation
Oh right . 
um then he ,  he you know ,  he is not necessarily a guard but rather he he is the one that deals ,  with keeping the prisoners occupied
Yeah
so that they don't have you know
fights and that ,  yeah
time to do any other thing
yes I wanted ,  I was interested in doing that
aha
but then like ,  I have many friends in that . 
aha
talking with them they say is good ,  because you are inside there always in the jail and that but the only thing is that after a while you feel as if you are also imprisoned
well
because you are locked up also there with them inside there , 
well that
the only thing different is that you can home at night . 
yes ,  the good thing about him is that he's not inside one of those childish dormitories ,  he is outside his is the one that ,  gives them the basketballs
yeah , 
you know the music ,  whatever ,  so he is not you know in the dormitories
and he has a revolver there when he's working or when he goes out . 
no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  nor when he goes out neither . 
Oh ,  he doesn't have a revolver ,  when he goes out . 
no ,  with the department of justice
yes
or federal bureau of prisons
yes
they don't give them a revolver when they are inside because they think
Okay no ,  here neither but when they leave work . 
neither ,  that's the only department that doesn't give them eh ,  a revolver
here ,  here there are a few that have . 
look
unless it is since we are in New York
aha
that ,  because ,  according to them the only reason they give them the revolver is because if someone who has been imprisoned sees you in the street that recognizes you he can hurt you
wow
That's why here they give the guns to the correction officers
no he ,  he has he ,  he can carry it if he wants ,  well not if he wants ,  is that
yes
the institution where he works hasn't given it to him
oh
and many of the people at ,  at work want the guns ,  but he doesn't want it because he doesn't want to be you know ,  carrying a gun all the time
yes
especially since we have ,  you know a small girl but ,  that is something that the people where he works at are trying to you know ,  to ,  to request
but he ,  every year he has to go to what do they call it to what is it called ,  I even forgot the English
eh , 
a shutting man
yeah ,  yeah ,  then he has to not only do it to let's say ,  to where he works but he also has eh ,  a a
ah ,  ah ,  ah ,  I'm forgetting the words he has a special training
yes
that to be able eh ,  to take the prisoners ,  let's say from the jail to the hospital . 
Oh transport
right then that's why he also has to do the shooting
shooting yes well here all the correctional officers they simply give it to them ,  because you know that in a correctional facility that they do something ,  happens inside they give them that . 
yes
sometimes ,  when they go out to the street ,  you know what they say ,  the world is a small place .  And they can run into them ,  many times we have have heard on the police radios
that there are correctional officers that are hitting them on the street
wow
And the police has to go to help them
wow
they cal a ten thirteen or correctional officer getting [hit] and they say the code they're giving about it
Well ,  thank god here where he's working ,  there are prisoners ,  but not violent ,  and he says the reason for that is that many of the people who go to prison here in Miami
yes
don't want to leave Miami
yeah
so many times they behave ,  because you know ,  if they don't ,  they send them to other places ,  let's say New York ,  Oregon ,  whatever
yes ,  it's like every month ,  like ,  you can't judge the person because there are lots of people that have gone to prison but it's for things
yes
that they didn't do
yes
or things that you know you make mistakes ,  that it's a mistake ,  but it's something illegal
Right
Because look ,  just because they fought ,  and it's not them
Right
but they have to take both people to hear both sides od the story ,  and you're harming the record of a person no matter how innocent it is ,  they didn't do it ,  but you have to arrest them both
for the simple reason is that right now if I go out with five guys in the street and I fall above a man it's good ,  you will say there were three of these guys are abusers ,  I gave it to this man
but ,  they will arrest me ,  they won't arrest him ,  when they ask me ,  why did you fall on this man ?   Oh ,  because he abused someone who I used to see . 
yes
and they have to find out because you said this . 
yes
Because this happened here ,  there was a man who fell on ,  the let the man go ,  and the boys were trying ,  you know how the police were ,  oh ,  shut up you clowns ,  right
hmm
and because he went ,  because the man had seen a robbery in the area ,  and the boys saw him and they sent him to check it out
wow
and they let the man go ,  but after ten ,  fifteen minutes they caught the man .   They jumped on the guys because ,  it's like I say ,  many people will prey . 
They're ,  they don't seem innocent because they did something ,  they did it but by mistake ,  in error
well thank God that you know ,  he where he works ,  like I said ,  eh ,  I know that he doesn't tell me all the details ,  you know ,  because he told me once and I
and he works at night or by day
he works from two thirty to nine
at night
every days except ,  yes except Tuesday and Wednesday so you know ,  from Thursday to Monday
yes
no ,  I don't want to say that we don't have a life ,  but no ,  we can't go out and can't do anything because he's working . 
yeah
so it makes it a bit difficult but at least he has a job . 
well it's like my ,  and you don't work ? 
no ,  I stay here at home with the kid
oh ,  you see ,  the mom of my daughter works too ,  she's a supervisor in a clinic
aha
well she works five ,  no ,  five days a week ,  right a week ,  then the other week she works seven days . 
wow
one week five ,  one week seven ,  like that
wow
But the days that ,  sometimes when she works I'm not working and when I work she's come home from work ,  well ,  one of us is always here . 
wow
and I work five days
Well this is why I was asking you about the schedule ,  because his schedule isn't ,  you know ,  it's not difficult ,  but right now he's coming home and we still haven't eaten dinner . 
and the problem is that before having kids ,  you know ,  it didn't matter ,  we couldn't wait
he works from two thirty in the afternoon to nine thirty at night . 
hmm and this isn't bad ,  because at least he's not working from ten to six
yeah
you know
no ,  like you say ,  today I don't work ,  or tomorrow
aha
Sunday ,  Monday I work ,  but next week I have to work Friday and Saturday and Sunday because it's for the clubs ,  the night clubs
aha
I have to go to the night clubs to dance and something like that
That ,  not ,  yes ,  I think that the two parties are okay ,  but I sometimes think that we could have more than two parties
Because there are lots of different things that those two parties don't touch upon and the problem with that is that the country could become even more divided
So ,  to have more parties you need to have a government style that is more ,  like ,  what do I know ,  more like ,  what's the name ,  the ones that those countries have
that all the parties get together and instead of being elected ,  they form a majority and and they try to achieve a common platform
between two or three different parties so that they are stronger ,  like in the Parliament .  The two parties are different ,  they are not the same .  That's the way I see it
The thing is that both suffer the same problem and that is that have a campaign it requires too much money so they
have to ask for money to the people that has money ,  the corporations ,  so ,  once the corporations and wealthy people give them money
then they are bound to them ,  to those people and even if they don't want to ,  they are influenced by them because they need that people
the politicians need the rich people so ,  they are always going to do things that benefit them ,  because they need them ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  they can't act against them because then they wouldn't get any money
for their campaigns ,  the party that gets more money wins ,  so that's the problem .  I wouldn't want to read oh
that a campaign doesn't have to be paid ,  I mean ,  everything that the candidate says is shown in the television ,  the radio
oh ,  the Internet ,  everywhere ,  so oh ,  they air that info ,  what the candidates say ,  so ,  they just speak about the different issues
and they air it for free ,  and at the same hour ,  no not ,  at midnight or at one o'clock in the morning but during a key hour ,  lets say around seven o'clock . 
Or in the mornings ,  sure ,  the broadcasters would loose money ,  maybe ,  but maybe if they all get a certain amount of money , 
that is the same from both parties ,  then they wouldn't have to buy or sell them to the politicians ,  through people or companies that have lots of money
so that they are sure that they will be politically benefited .  I think that's the way it should be ,  but oh ,  oh
we are in it now ,  in it now ,  no ?  It's been hard to pass laws that change the campaign rules .  It's
because of course ,  both sides ,  they are trying to get an advantage even if they have lots of flaws ,  I think that the countries that have ,  thousands of parties
and well ,  nothing happens ,  nobody ,  nobody ,  they can't move forward because there's so much division ,  they are broken ,  and at the same time ,  we don't want
a country in which one party has all the strength and does whatever they want ,  like Argentina with the Peronistas . 
Mm ,  I think I am not very aware about what is going on ,  about Mexican politics ,  but it seems to me that maybe what's going on there
And some other countries .  Where there is a party with all that strength ,  mm ,  they do whatever they want ,  and if you don't do what they want then
they block it ,  that's the danger when there are only two parties .  And that is the danger we face in the United States
Because we are very divided ,  very divided .  And all the power is held by one party now .  This party has the ,  eh ,  judges ,  the Congress ,  the Presidency
So ,  there is nothing and nobody controlling each other ,  to be sure that no party is taking advantage .  So
this is the danger of having only two parties .  If there were three or four ,  then there can never be a party ,  it would be much more difficult ,  that one party has
all the power .  But ,  once you have three or four ,  why not five ,  why not ten ,  why not twenty ?  So this is a balance
Excuse me ,  you ,  you ,  where are you from ? 
I am Argentinean
And how is it in Argentina ? 
In Argentina ,  there are several parties .  But there are several parties which are all of the 'Peronistas' .  They have different names but they are all 'Peronistas' ,  and then there is the Radical Party
And then there are other parties ,  but they are all very small ones .  But ,  since Peron ,  the party who holds the power is the 'Peronist' country ,  or whatever name it has
aha
it has .  And when comes a president from another party ,  then they are expelled .  They
go on strikes ,  they block them somehow ,  so they can't go on ,  and finally the president has to resign ,  and have new elections
yes .  Like we say ,  'back the donkey to the wheat'
mhm
Now ,  the present President ,  he is of a Peronist party .  But ,  mm ,  it seems to me that he is doing good things
but he is Peronist that I think is someone in a Peronist disguise
mhm
TO be able ,  having entered to be able
To work ,  let's say
follow his policy ,  yes .   This is what it seems to me .   And where are you from ? 
from Mexico actually . 
Hmm
And you were giving your opinion about politics in Mexico too
yes ,  well ,  it's the ,  it's the impression that I have .   Without knowing anything ,  eh . 
hmm
No ,  no ,  the truth is that I know less than a little ,  but ,  how are the parties there ? 
Well ,  it's ,  during many years it was actually governed by only one party .   The "Pri" party
Hmm
In fact Fox ,  is the first President who doesn't belong to the party in power
Oh
Eh ,  he's from the "Pan" and the "Pri . "  The Institutional Revolutionary party has been the one that governed during all those years .  A little
similar to what you're telling me ,  eh ,  in
In Argentina , 
in ,  in Argentina ,  with the Peronista ,  no ? 
yes ,  hmm
This ,  yes ,  Fox ,  eh ,  has also been putting many blocks on a legislative level ,  the Deputies .   At the time that this passed the proposals in exchange . 
Well they didn't let them pass because ,  eh ,  there in the Legislative Chamber they don't have the majority ,  the President's party . 
Sure . 
That is always a means of balance .  Balance when ,  when there are two or eh or very established powers like it is here Right ? 
yes . 
The same happens that in the Legislative Chamber well that just Right ?  All the proposals of the President are not voted and ,  it endela ?  a little there . 
Well the actions of one party ,  Right ?  But is true that in Mexico there are many parties .  but well ,  is eh The Government
gives them money for their campaigns ,  and is a dumping of money in reality .  Almost ,  almost that there what ,  you know that each Presidential campaign ,  the parties are formed
and are ,  in a way very opportunists many of them . 
Ah ,  to get the money of
To get the money and yes ,  they didn't get enough votes to continue ,  for the following period ,  simply well the following the following round they change the name
and form another party again
Ah . 
they get the money and I mean that ,  well
These politicians
There there's a terrible corruption ,  Right ? 
mm
But ,  but well the three important parties that have always been competing so to speak are ,  The Revolutionary Party ,   PRD
mm
Party of the Democratic Revolution ,  that now has an important candidate ,  in which the Mexicans are putting their hopes on .  And it would be a very different proposal
to what there's been with the other two traditional parties .  Which are the "Pan" and the "Pri" ,  like I was telling you
yes . 
Is Lopez Obrador .  Who has been the Governor of the city .  The Regent of the city and has had very consistent and important actions . 
And well so ,  being in a city of twenty six million people
Is like a country . 
Is like a country .  And since he's really done important things .  He's very at the head of all the
mm
eh these opinion polls ,  Right ? 
yes . 
Then is going to be very interesting now the
Ah ,  then now I'm going to understand a little more . 
the
Because it turns out that my parents are six months here and six months there .  Then when they are here I have to eh ,  I put in
I put in the cable the Hispanic channels
of course
And then this in the  CNN in Spanish .  One finds out a lot more .  Than in the regular  CNN that I hear in English .  Because I since nine years old
have been here ,  since seventy four .  I'm fifty years old . 
aha ,  And are you working here ? 
Eh ,  yes ,  since the ,  since I was nine years old that ,  that I live in the United States . 
Ah ,  wow .  no ,  well all your life then , 
yes ,  yes .  And then ,  in the  CNN in English ,  they repeat everything and ,  and is only what's happening here and some things . 
However in the Spanish  CNN
mm
one finds out about other countries ,  and find out much more of Mexico of course because is here next to us and of other things ,  then sometimes when I hear 
hear news from Mexico I don't understand too well what is happening ,  but now what you explained to me will help me . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes of course ,  yes it helps .  And really ,  this Lopez Obrador calls a lot ,  a lot of people ,  he's been helping .  People of scarce resources . 
Elderly people ,  he's given them
Um
a grant ,  paltry because is sixty ,  no not sixty I think that it had been like forty dollars a month
Uh
to each of the old people but since there's no security for them ,  there was no security for them in Mexico
yes . 
well that has mean ,  almost ,  almost the difference between life and death for these people .  Right ? 
Ah ,  ah
Hi
Hi ,  What's your name ? 
Mayra ,  Who am I talking to ? 
eh Pilar
Pilar ,  Where are you ? 
What ? 
Where are you ? 
In New York ,  And you ? 
ah OK ,  it's Philadelphia ,  you're close by mhm
Philadelphia mh ,  And what do you think about ,  about politics ? 
I don't know about politics it seems to me that it's very different here in the United States of here in Mexico but for what I've been
I don't know seeing people and all I don't like it here ,  that you must be by force on one side you have to be either Republican or Democrat
yes you think
and people yes ,  I think ,  well it seems that they're too extremist in their decisions they make like that I mean always they're either Democrats or Republicans and that's it
like that conservatives or liberals and that's it
yeah well there are more parties but they have very little
yes ,  yes
it seems that they have very little right
yes ,  that's the bad thing And what do you think ?  What's your opinion ?  of the
well I'm the same ,  I come from Spain and I don't know much about politics here and I don't I mean I'm not very informed ,  but I don't like it for whatever little I know I don't like the government they have right now
mhm
the United States
mhm
And I don't know if the other party was going to be better ,  it seems to me that they are kind of the same
I believe they are pretty similar regarding economy and economic issues
yes ,  there are not lots
I mean ,  they have to be similar ,  I mean ,  there's no other way
yes ,  it's just that women's rights and
yes ,  I believe so ,  I think that's where the main difference is
yes but
I think one is pretty conservative and then they decide all this and the other  is more liberal and about acknowledging ore rights ,  decisions
and the other one is a bit conservative ,  the other one is just a bit conservative . 
mhm ,  that's the bad thing ,  I mean ,  it's just ,  or at least to me ,  t he people I've spoken to ,  we are worried as everything is becoming so conservative . 
and they are electing key persons for the government that are so conservative and with a similar ideology for the government
mm
but they won't last that long ,  this is going to last until Bush leaves because for example ,  well
that are to be used in the United States ,  I don't think it will change in a long time ,  I don't know if that's a good thing ,  to me ,  it's a backward step too
that they are doing that
yes ,  yes ,  don't you think that people here doesn't vote ,  oh ,  by a party ?  They vote as a tradition or for the specific candidate that wants to be President
I don't know ,  it's about the parties spending ,  they spend so much money in the campaigns because people ,  that's what they vote for . 
yes ,  yes that seems a lot like them ,  well is what I saw many people didn't even know what it was what it was they were offering or proposing and all but rather it was like
proposing yes
this one is Christian ,  we are all Christians ,  that's good
hm
and already I mean it seemed ,  so I don't know how good the arguments they both presented in the campaigns were
yes ,  yes
I mean it surprised me a lot the result of the vote I never thought it would've turned out like that but I don't know
well here by the east coast the people didn't
yes ,  no
didn't ,  didn't believe what came out in the result ,  no is that it can't be
yes ,  no well I think that around the world ,  no I imagine in ,  in other countries ,  what they must've thought ,  someone told me for example in Japan
when they found out they came out with a video in the news that everybody was laughing they thought that it was funny that they seriously voted for him
incredible it was like that so ridiculous ,  so absurd that they just laughed
for me I felt I like crying ,  I felt like
I got very mad
I felt like crying more than laughing
yes no yes I got very mad but I think that they were seeing like that how absurd everything could be
yes
yes ,  yes it really surprises me sometimes that such things happen
yes but is that the government ,  doesn't have a good strategy unfortunately ,  they know how to say what to say to convince the majority in this country the people that don't have much
much education or many ideas ,  so that they believe everything they say
well yes ,  hmm
and they get their votes and then they do what they want because they don't do what they say either ,  they do what they feel like and a little more
hmm
it's really sad ,  truly ,  but well ,  in this country it's like this but not as extreme ,  but
it's not the same ,  I'm from Mexico ,  for example and this ,  really is a campaign that only
but there's a little
tries to sell an imagine or do what they can and yeah ,  and after
yes and then when you come to power and do what you want ,  no
hmm
yes it's the same in Spain it's the same in Spain there are two parties to ,  well ,  I think it's like this everywhere ,  those who are the most powerful
yes
and when one of them is in power ,  the other ,  the opposition dedicates themselves to criticizing everything the other parties does ,  the same ,  it's all bad
yes hmm
and when it's their turn it's the other party who criticizes ,  everything is bad and then the dedicate those in the government try to change and undo everything that the others have done ,  they undo it
yes ,  to undoing it and then they start again ,  yes
yes ,  and the country doesn't progress much
hmm and what are the two ,  what are they two parties called
eh ,  they're called the popular party which is the more conservative
hmm
the workers socialist Spanish party is the most liberal one but the other too are kind of liberal too
okay ,  okay
oh ,  the truth is ,  they are kind of in the center but the problem is that ,  or at least it seems like the socialist party just wants to vote against everything . 
yes
yes ,  well the popular party has now lost the last elections because of the bombings in Madrid ,  do you remember ?  I don't know if you know about it but do you remember that there were some terrorist attacks in Madrid last year ? 
mm ,  in Mexico ,  in Mexico is also like that ,  I'm from there and we have two or three
in March
parties that are quite similar
mhm
but the they are not divided in conservatives or liberal because nobody is really that liberal anyway
I see
I mean ,  I don't know everything about women rights but they are not even discussed in Mexico ,  so ,  I believe that the only difference is that
yes
I don't know ,  they said that their first priority was ,  I don't know
mhm
the economy really but they are all so similar ,  I think that the only reason why they voted for the other party is because we were tired of the old one . 
and people wanted a change
yes
so ,  they voted but it was for the worse and now they don't know what to do because you have to go back to what it used to be or stay with the one that never did anything
yes that's right ,  that same thing happened in Madrid
yes
The socialist party was in the government for twelve years ,  and at the end they voted for the other party because they were doing it bad and people was tired of them ,  and changed ,  right ? 
mhm
the other party stayed for eight years but had also his problems and there was another change ,  but ,  none of them are good ,  people don't like any of them
well ,  yes ,  yes ,  I think that's how we are here too
there comes a point when you realize that both of them are equally bad ,  that all the politicians lie a lot ,  that everything
you never ,  you can never trust what they say ,  it's sad .  it's quite sad
mhm
it's very sad after all
yes ,  yes ,  that's what I have seen ,  not long ago there were elections and I was not here ,  I mean ,  I arrived the next day and I didn't even notice ,  so
people has so little interest that nobody ,  not mu family nor my friends ,  told em there was going to be an election
mhm ,  but they voted ,  didn't they ? 
in the city ,  yes ,  no ,  in Mexico in general ,  I think they vote quite a lot ,  I mean ,  the rate is much higher than here in the United States ,  I think so ,  I'm not sure
but this time it was surprisingly low ,  yes ,  nobody was interested
people ,  you see ,  don't know who to vote for
yes ,  yes ,  there is nobody worth voting for
I think so ,  I don't know if I'm right but I think that young people is not as interested in politics as they were before ,  I mean
our parents' generation
mhm
politics was very important then ,  the age of the revolutions and
well yes I think so ,  is that
and now however the young people don't care
mm now that yes is not time of money or of working in banks and all the rest I think
yes the people don't have any reason to get into politics ,  right
mm ,  yes that I don't know either .  And what do you do ? 
WHat ? 
What do you do
study ,  I'm studying ,  And you ? 
okay also the same ,  I'm in the third year of the university now
mm And what are you studying
I study chemical engineering
ah really me ,  me electrical
yes really ah seriously ,  okay
yes
and the ones that live there in the university of New York some did vote because many of my friends didn't vote here either
no is that me my friends here are all Spaniards
ah okay
then no ,  no we can't vote but well yes I knew an American that was in my class and we did a project together and he did vote and also eh
he got very mad ,  he was from California although he lived here
mm
I get very angry at the world the result
yes of course . 
there is nothing that can be changed
there is nothing that can be changed
mhm
It is very difficult to change a law that has been imposed
It is very difficult to change a law that has been imposed
many states have changed very much
they removed the theory of evolution of the primary books
really
they removed the theory of evolution of the primary books
it is true I have also read that and I can not  believe it
I don´t know how anyone can do that
they removed the theory of evolution and say that God created everything
they are teaching in the place of evolution
the government agrees with the parties
mhm
the truth is that it is incredible
yes ,  no and no one has said anything . 
they have complained many times
yes ,  I never heard a big racket about that ,  I would've ,  well I don't know I wouldn't let my kid go to a school like that
no ,  no ,  certainly ,  the truth ,  it's about I think the strategy here of the United States Is not
I have no idea
Hello ,  this is Mercedes ,  hello ,  yes
hello ,  i don't ,  ¿how are you ?  ,  hello ,  fine ,  ¿how are you ?  ,  oh ,  well ,  and ,  ¿what's your name ? 
Fine ,  uh ,  Mercedes ,  yes
It's mercedes ,  oh ,  and my [name] is
Nice to meet you ,  well ,  we have to talk about politics
Yeah ,  and i don't know much about politics because people is very uh ,  there's a lot of corruption ,  so i don't like politics a lot ,  and you ? 
uh ,  oh
I don't know much about
Oh ,  no ,  well ,  not much either ,  but still a bit ,  more or less ,  and ,  ¿can you vote here in the United States ? 
oh ,  ¿where do you live ? 
Uh ,  in Philadelphia
Oh ,  and i [live] in New York ,  yeah
And ,  ¿can you vote in New York ,  have you ever voted ? 
yeah ,  they're coming in November
Ok ,  right
You know ,  so i don't know ,  i don't know
And what ,  ¿and what did you think about the last candidate you voted for ? 
i don't know
The candidate for which you voted in November
I'm not ,  i don't know ,  maybe ,  maybe yeah ,  yes ,  yes ,  i don't know ,  and you ? 
okay ,  ah well ,  I can't vote here in the United States
oh
no ,  eh ,  because I'm not a citizen
oh ,  and my husband too
hmm ,  hmm ,  okay
so it's a problem for ,  you know ,  but I don't like the people you know
aha
so I don't know ,  you have a husband ? 
yes
and girl or boy ,  daughter ,  son ,  yes ,  how old are you ? 
ah ,  thirty
ohh and I'm forty eight
aha okay
oh you ,  you're very young ,  I have a daughter and she's thirty ,  you know
yes okay ,  and what do you think ,  for example ,  that there are only two dominant parties
that
what do you think that there are two dominant parties
ah I don't know
do you agree yes or no
maybe yes you know ,  and you
okay ah ,  not completely because if they dominate the majority of the votes
mm
then eh ,  if they dominate too much and perhaps there's no opportunity for candidates who perhaps have more qualifications
aha ,  mm
but that belong to parties eh that are no as popular to get ahead
oh ,  oh you ,  you work
yes
oh ,  okay
and what do you also think for example of mm eh you mentioned the corruption before
yes a lot of corruption and
aha ,  what have you lived ,  the area where you live any experience with the corruption for example ,  mm
yes an example there's mm I don't know I don't know you know it has a lot of corruption but I don't know what type or where you know
mm
no but ,  but you know I know there's a lot of corruption
ah okay but what type of situation has seemed corrupt to you to say that there's too much corruption
ah ,  let me see ,  mm maybe ,  maybe you know ,  president Bush ,  ah I is mm I don't know you think
no since ,  ah okay ,  aha yes yes ,  yes well and that's the type of problem that having two dominant parties cause that ah when someone arrives to power they abuse the situation
yeah do you have identification to vote ,  where are you from . 
no I'm originally from Honduras ,  Honduras ,  yes
ah where ,  oh Honduras ,  oh and me here in ah ,  in ah in the United States but my mom she's black
hmm ,  hmm
and dad comes from Puerto Rico so you know I don´t know too much about Honduras but you know it has many problems there right Are there many problems in Honduras ? 
hmm ,  yes with politics right
well yeah
eh right now this year is the election year
aha yeah
and and we also have the problem of four political parties
aha
but only two parties are the most prevalent then eh ,  there are people that ,  the people who usually are the candidates are people with a lot of money and they abuse of their power ,  hmm ,  yes
oh ,  oh ,  no and how many years have ah you lived here in the
ah ,  I have been here around seven years
oh seven do you like eh United States ,  do you like it
yes that is fine ,  yes  I hope eventually to become a citizen and could vote

yes ,  yes yes
oh boy I have eleven ,  eleven and yes
yes ,  well eh continuing with the political issue and what do you think about the political system division in the United States with the Senate ,  the congress and
mja ,  mja
the president ,  do you think he is intelligent ,  logical or not ,  do you agree
well we have you know Bloomberg you know the Bloomberg ,  oh he is very rich but he does not have
hmm oh yes yes yes
much population but I don´t know maybe
hmm
he is not very rich so he is important no problem
hmm
but we have Cedan you know Fernando Cedan
no
yes ,  he's Hispanic ,  and he comes from Puerto Rico so ,  but you know ,  he doesn't have a lot of money so it's not good for him
ahhh yes I was reading an article that said that Bloomberg doesn't get a salary
no ,  no ,  no ,  yes ,  he's really rich ,  really rich
that he works for a dollar his salary ,  aha ,  that his salary is a dollar ,  hmm . 
so yeah ,  only because he's really rich
hmm
many people say this because he ,  he doesn't work for more than a dollar
for a ,  but yes it's true ,  he only works for a dollar
yeah yes
and ehh ,  he's satisfied with the work that he does
yeah true
he's satisfied with the work that he does ,  yes or no
ahh may be yes ,  may be no ,  I don't know ,  I don't know ,  I don't know him much
is he better than Giuliani ? 
ah ,  Giuliani really really good too ,  I don't know ,  you know ,  but he has ,  Giuliani has a lot of corruption too
ahh
but you know ,  everyone likes Giuliani ,  you know ,  yeah ,  and you ,  ahhh ,  what's he called ,  your mayor
ahh ,  yes ,  the ,  hmm ,  we
Hello .  Hello . 
yes ? 
Ah ,  I couldn't hear you .  my name is Zulma ,  from Texas . 
Ah ,  I'm Manuel from Chicago ah ,  we talked yesterday no
Ah we got again ,  the same topic . 
Yeah . 
Okay ,  It's going to be hard to have another conversation on the same thing . 
yes . 
Do you want to start ? 
Mm I don't know what .  I can't think of anything . 
Mm yes . 
Ah .  I suppose that basically I can't think of anything because the same as yesterday ,  ah . 
yes , 
It's just that I didn't think it was the same . 
yes .  It was very hard understand what he was saying but I think that I'm understanding and it says that if the Democratic party and the Democrats are one pea in a pod . 
did you notice when he was saying what we had to talk about ? 
yes ,  yes ,  ah eh there are many things that you can't understand him . 
I didn't understand that at the beginning ,  yes ,  many times you can't understand him to good .  But I think that what he was saying is that if they are two
pods in a pod .  I mean that if they are the same thing or they are different . 
Yeah . 
yes ,  Hm
so ,  what do you think about that ? 
like I told you before ,  I believe in many things
the same
I think they have many things towards the end only care about one sector of society
Mhm
in other words they should do more for society but they are like two giants in a pond
yeah
there are things that divide society ,  for instance the right of homosexuals
yeah
the republicans say yes and the democrats say no
other thing is how the money is spend republicans believe that there should be less social programs
the government should not be taking care of  people´s expenses
yes
so they cut social programs for people ,  who truly needs it . 
all the programs such as Madicaid ,  Medicare ,  en the social security .  The republicans do not like this programs
In the USA they use too much money for that
yeah ,  I have heard that a lot
what about democrats ? 
Yes ,  I saw that they are against that ,  there are many people who truly needs it but there are also people who don´t even needs it . 
Mm .  mm
I don't know what they base it on ,  in what they are I mean ,  what they latch on to to want to remove it . 
Mm .  yes . 
I don't know . 
yes ,  yes ,  no .  I agree that there are many people that ,  that don't need the ,  that ,  the money from that program and use it however . 
There are many people that ,  that can work and don't want to ,  or ,  or there are many people that that lie so they give them that money ,  when they shouldn't be collecting the money . 
Yeah . 
But there are many people that do need it and you can't simply cut all the programs or ,  or put such strong restrictions that then nobody can benefit from the programs . 
Exactly . 
But I think that the problem with the republicans is that they decide to use the money in other things like in the military power or ah they give incentives to ,  to
companies ,  to big companies that have a lot of money and then instead of giving tax incentives to the people that have small businesses ,  for example . 
Mm ,  Yeah ,  Oh no ,  I don't know what else to tell you . 
Today we have to talk for twelve minutes because if we don't talk for twelve complete minutes ,  our call doesn't count . 
Yeah ,  yes ,  I know . 
yes ,  yes .  And you well that have never decided to vote ,  how come you've never been interested in politics ?  why ? 
Well ,  for the same as many others .  That's very complicated and
Mm . 
sometimes you go and if you want to vote ,  you vote and after you voted ,  I don't know in a month ,  two ,  three months when they make the change in government and all
you realize that well in reality it wasn't what you were expecting . 
Mm . 
I mean ,  you get all your hopes up that now this will change ,  this year will be different ,  this president from this party will do this
and practically  yes they do for well for certain people only . 
Mm . 
But at least one at least ,  at least me eh I don't ,  don't notice much that one's help makes much of a difference who wins . 
Mm . 
Perhaps if they do it one notices it but that doesn't interest me much .  That's why what I've been seeing like I was telling you already since
ah from Mexico you see it countries always the same and the same and the same and I don't know ,  that has never called my attention . 
But do you keep informed of what's happening or not ? 
Well yes ,  sure ,  yes ,  I just keep out ,  not very
Mm ,  mm
yes ,  yes I'm ah aware of all that's happening and all but up to there and nothing more . 
yes .  I think that it's important that the people ,  I mean that the ,  that that the people are active in ,  the politics of the country where one lives . 
The problem is that there are many countries like this one where well there's no option . 
Mm . 
Then is hard for one to be interested in the politics when ,  when there are really no options or one feels that they are wasting their time
Alright . 
when you go to ,  to register to vote or try to keep up to date with what's happening if there's no difference ,  or one feels that one can't make a difference . 
Yeah . 
And I think that the American culture is like that ,  here the majority of the people don't vote .  The majority of the people don't feel that ,  that
that there's no ,  it doesn't make a difference if the people go to vote or not . 
Yeah .   Hmm . 
And after there were problems like in the elections ,  ah ,  they ones before the past ones .   Do you remember that there was this problem ? 
Oh yes . 
They didn't know ,  they didn't know who had won the presidency . 
Yeah . 
and they had these problems in Florida and they didn't know if someone had tampered or not . 
Oh yes ,  they were fighting because they said that in Florida it was when they said that ,  that it was the last state they needed ,  that they didn't know
That it depended mostly on this state who won ,  no ? 
yes ,  yes ,  because the voting system in the United States is really strange . 
Yeah . 
Like ,  people vote for the president but this doesn't count . 
Aha . 
Like ,  you go and vote and af  this number of people ,  it doesn't count .   Each state has a number of representatives ,  who are those who go to vote . 
So
So they're the ones who count . 
these are the ones who count .   So
Yeah . 
if everyone votes for republicans then these representatives would also vote for republicans .   But the number of representatives varies from state to state . 
yes . 
So ,  what happened in these elections ,  Al Gore ,  who was running for president ,  won the vote of the people . 
Mhm . 
I mean ,  most of the people voted for him , 
Yeah
but as what it really counts is the number of representatives ,  the number of the representatives ,  then Bush won because Florida voted for him ,  so Bush won the elections
yes . 
So ,  it doesn't make any sense ,  this is a pretty old system ,  the ones that they established since the beginning when the colonies first settled here in the United States
there were problems because the North didn't get along with the South because the North was against slavery and the South was in favor of it
And when they decided to unite and become just one country
Yeah . 
nobody wanted the other to have more power ,  so ,  the ones from the North didn't want the ones from the South to be more powerful than them
Yeah . 
And there were lots of people in the South and not that much in the North ,  so ,  that's why they decided to use this voting system ,  so that the ones from the South wouldn't win all the time because of more people living there . 
Well yeah but right now it's more like a tradition that has been around for years
yes . 
and it didn't happen ,  I don't think they are going to change their voting system
yes .  No ,  I ,  lots of people say it should be changed because it's an old fashioned system and it shouldn't be that way . 
Because of these types of problems ,  some states should definitely not be penalized for others ,  or against the others
Yeah . 
well ,  that's what they say ,  they are united ,  they are just one country and all of that but I think that nobody ,  nobody wants to change it . 
The Americans hold tight to their traditions ,  politically they stick to their traditions .

Good afternoon .  Mildre from Connecticut . 
Hello ,  good afternoon ,  my name is Maira . 
Maira ,  where are you from ? 
From Philadelphia . 
Oh ,  they put a lot of people from Philadelphia . 
Mm .  yes ,  that's what I've noticed ,  who knows why ?  yes ,  how are you ?  Where are you from originally ? 
Well ,  the university ,  I think ,  that's over there ,  right ? 
yes ,  is here ,  I'm in the university ,  in fact . 
Ah ,  that's why .  Ah ,  that's why eh
Then ,  they are the ones that are doing the project ,  but here I haven't seen that much advertising .  Then ,  rather is people from the city . 
No ,  I think they do it more by internet . 
Perhaps ,  or Perhaps people from the city ,  perhaps they've advertised in the city .  Not in the university .  I want to try . 
So ,  what do you think of politics ? 
Mm ,  I don't know . 
You are not a voter yet ? 
What ? 
Are you a voter or not ? 
No ,  no ,  not yet ,  hardly ,  well in Mexico I could but not here . 
You don't vote .  Oh ,  okay . 
Anyways .  But I don't know ,  anyways I don't even know what to say of politics ,  I didn't understand what that man said ,  he speaks terrible . 
But but
Eh ,  eh ,  what the want to ,  what they want to know is whether you think there are distinctions among parties ,  mm ,  let's say if there is an agreement
do you think that they reach such agreemnets even belonging to different parties ? 
Mhm .  What I have seen is that lately there are only liberal and re  ,  de  and regular ,  I mean there isn't even a difference about economy
or ,  between countries ,  or trade or whatever it is they are doing ,  but they are only stating on staying by the side of religion and
and being ,  being conventional ,  and the others want rights .  And that's it ,  that is all I am seeing lately ,  and it looks to me that they are moving to both extremes ,  for some reason
So ,  it looks to me that politics here in the United States is becoming a battle between them both ,  to see who makes everything a little more conventional and how
the liberals make it to defeat the current government and so on ,  but I don't know . 
It is always a ,  a  ,  how you call it ?  a little ,  a little different ,  well I think that now even the democrats themselves  are dividing
and what do you think ?  Mm
They are ,  they are somehow ,  eh ,  quitting ,  you know
Mm ,  they are just fighting ,  I think
yes ,  they are getting angry with themselves ,  they are
Mhm
like they don't want other candidates and they don't help themselves .  I think there are divisions in the country ,  as long as there are two different parties
Sure
there will always be a division ,  but that doesn't mean ,  because in your country ,  if you vote
Mhm
and don't vote ,  eh ,  do you vote for the candidate or for the party ? 
Oh ,  I don't know
Because ,  because your beliefs are a part of ,  of if your family comes from this party ,  or you vote for
No ,  I think that . 
for your own belief ? 
It's for the candidate generally .   In Mexico ,  I saw ,  now they're doing it more for the candidate because he's given a party ,  no ?   they don't make any difference . 
Like ,  they don't give you any guarantee that they will do it better . 
Aha . 
So ,  I don't know ,  but here for example ,  I've seen how the parties have an idea ,  no ?   So the liberals generally follow ,  like ,  the democrats generally follow this ,  eh ,  this side
and the republicans follow the other .   But what I don't understand is this ,  if none of the two is very good ,  who can't there be something in between ?   like ,  why does it have to forcibly be
liberals or republicans ,  eh ,  and everyone else who isn't necessarily in the extremes . 
No ,  just remember that they come from different ideas ,  some are more conservative and others are more ,  how would you say ?  More liberal ,  they're called . 
Hmm . 
You know ?   The ideas of the republicans are a little more conservative
Hmm . 
and the democrats ,  well they are a little more liberal to make decisions and all these issues . 
Well ,  yes .   But I don't know why they can't at least have ,  one in the middle who's a little more neutral for people who aren't on one of the two extremes . 
I don't know . 
Well ,  there have been different parties ,  and what happens is they don't get enough votes to enter into the ,  the
On the list ,  well ,  whatever
yes ,  the list ,  exactly ,  no
they don't recognize them . 
they can't they cant' go in because even the candidates need a certain amount of votes to get in ,  they have primaries and see if
they get enough votes to enter the the the the race
Mhm . 
the ballots ,  to vote
Mhm
I think it's hard to work when they decide between one party and a different one wins ,  it's makes it harder for the winner
you know ,  to have to work with the others in getting their approval
yes . 
it's quite hard . 
yes ,  they always fight ,  no ?  yes ,  I think they do ,  it's like if one of them is in power the other ones are against his proposals . 
No ,  but for as long as someone is in power ,  it's going to be a problem , 
Mhm . 
with that ,  I don't know ,  how is it ? 
Even now ,  anyway ,  this government is putting up so many
They can't
conservatives ,  no ?  In all the posts they are choosing conservative people ,  and that's what I was thinking ,  the day when this ,  when this
I mean ,  when Bush leaves and a new President arrives ,  well everything is going to be conservative . 
I mean ,  the judges in general ,  they are still going to be ,  I don't know if much is going to change because a new
Well ,  it has to change ,  there are so many things that the citizens don't like
No ? 
All the ,  they have to decide it when the next voting comes ,  what's what they have to change and what doesn't .  I vote because i think it's important that we ,  specially the hispanic ,  vote
Uh huh
And ,  when i got here ,  uh ,  well ,  in my country i participated in helping politicians ,  but here i got a little more involved in politics
Oh ,  ¿yes ? 
To fight for our rights ,  specially Hispanics in ,  uh ,  in Connecticut ,  here where i live ,  there are plenty ,  white people control almost everything ,  and they don't let the [ .  .  . ] participate much
the Hispanics
Uh huh
If we don't fight ,  well ,  we get nothing .  I have also worked with the ,  for Puerto Ricans ,  because i am Puerto Rican
Uh huh
to do all those things in favor of our community
Right
To disclose our roots ,  to let them be known everywhere ,  yes ,  i think it's important ,  it's the same with the voting
If you don't vote ,  you don't expose yourself ,  and you have no right
Well ,  that's it
¿Do you understand ?  ,  so
And why don't ,  ¿why is it that so many people don't vote here in the United States ? 
¿What ? 
Because i think about sixty percent of the people votes ,  ¿right ?  ,  they said
Uh ,  but ,  specially ,  most of the elections here depends on hispanics ,  but Hispanics have this mindset of "oh ,  I'm not voting because
I'm not american" ,  or "i'm not from
Mm . 
this country ,  I don't have to see ,  the laws here don't interest me but if you are living here you have to be interested for what's here because
here is where you are voting ,  you can't go to your country to vote .  I don't think that there are many countries that give you the right to vote like that
Well ,  yes ,  I think so . 
here in the United States you can be outside and can come to vote .  You can vote by mail that they do ,  and but there are other countries where that is not permitted ,  you have to be present to vote . 
But you need the nationality ,  right ?  to vote . 
Here ? 
Mm . 
Oh ,  no ,  you have to be an American citizen . 
yes ,  that's why ,  then ,  well maybe half the Hispanics still aren't . 
No ,  no but the majority of the Hispanics ,  even if they have the citizenship here there are people that have been here twenty and thirty years and ,  of my same people ,  Puerto Ricans ,  that we are American citizens ,  and don't vote . 
Mm .  Mm . 
They don't vote because of that mentality of ah ,  I ,  I ,  I don't live here ,  I'm Puerto Rican I say ,   Puerto Rican ,  the politics don't interest me . 
But we are here to fight for our rights and our benefits .  Eh ,  if we don't do that ,  and now we are getting more positions
yes . 
I was visiting the white house ,  with ,  with the school
Mm . 
and ,  and I saw that there are many ,  many Hispanics in good jobs in the white house .  Not all ,  not all the the
Then is good . 
governments give the Hispanics the opportunity ,  but there are certain Hispa  I mean ,  certain governors that do take the Hispanics into account ,  for jobs because they know that besides they are bilingual that they help them
we have a ,  the advantage that we speak two languages ,  after we learn English
Hmm .   Hmm . 
so ,  this is really important too . 
Well yes ,  but how nice that they're doing this ,  because if we're all like this we need a little ,  and what is the ,  you don't know what they say ,  then ,  for example ,  in California now ? 
Because those who also voted for the governor were almost all Hispanic and they're doing worse with the reforms he made ,  no ? 
Eh , 
I say ,  this is what I've heard ,  I didn't pay much attention ,  so the truth is that
Well ,  I don't know ,  I don't know ,  how popular ,  how much Hispanic population there in California ,  even if I think it's pretty big . 
yes . 
But I don't know if they were the ones who chose this candidate or if this candidate was chosen by the rest of the ,  the
the people who live there ,  you know ?   those who are really ,  Californian
Hmm . 
no ,  they aren't Hispanic because the Hispanic at times ,  it's well oriented ,  doesn't know how to vote ,  you know ?   doesn't know who the candidate is
so ,  sometimes ,  like ,  when they go to the polls ,  because I worked helping ,  you know ,  to orient them ,  they don't know where ,  what they have to do
you sometimes have to go in with them to the machine to explain to them what they have to do ,  how they can vote
eh ,  I think that they should give a few more classes ,  especially here in the United States so that they know more
Okay . 
it's not the same in your language as here ,  when you go ,  well ,  there it is ,  it's all in English ,  there aren't instructions in Spanish ,  you know ? 
Well ,  yes .   Hmm . 
When you go into the voting booth ,  it's all in English ,  there's nothing in Spanish ,  except what you're going to vote for but
In English .  Aha . 
and if there's not a person also that helps in the lists we realized one year
Mm . 
that they got all the votes of the ,  of the Hispanics and were saying ,  ah ,  you are not here in the list ,  you have to go to ,  they would send them to another
school ,  then ,  when they would send them to the other school to search in the list
yes ,  . 
already when they returned it was already late for them to be able to vote . 
Ah ,  really ? 
So ,  some one hundred fifty more people stayed without being able to vote that day because they would tell them that
Wow . 
ah ,  no ,  you are not here in the list ,  because there was nobody sitting in ,  in the desk ,  who spoke Spanish who would tell them well look
Ah ,  seriously ? 
this is your name but ,  or ,  or your name doesn't appear here
Mm . 
because you didn't register or ,  or maybe you filled out the paper and didn't take it to where it was
Mm . 
understand ?  so ,  no ,  eh we deci 
Hello ? 
Hello ,  good evening . 
Good evening ,  with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking ? 
With Norma ,  from here ,  Atlanta ,  Georgia
Ah ,  Norma ,  I think we already spoke once . 
Ah yes ? 
My ,  my name is Silvia ,  I live in Philadelphia . 
Ah ,  OK ,  yes yes ,  aha . 
yes it's true ,  that we spoke ,  that you were telling me
yes yes , 
that ,  that you had met that ,  that ,  em ,  you travelled with ,  with religious activities ,  and that you had met your husband ,  and that you had stayed there . 
Aha ,  Aha ,  yes . 
Aha ,  Aha I think you are from Venezuela ,  no . 
No ,  I'm Peruvian . 
Ah ,  from ,  from ,  yes well ,  yes . 
Aha
yes yes yes yes .  yes like no ,  I remember perfectly yes . 
No and how are you ,  what do you think about politics ? 
Ah ,  Nowadays nobody seems to know anything ,  right .  Look ,  tell me about politics in Peru .  I ,  many years ago that I'm not up to date with what is happening in Peru . 
Ah well ,  no ,  well I the truth is I don't know much ,  only the news nothing else . 
Well
So I've lived here for about ten years , 
Aha ,  aha ,  aha
No ,  and well ,  I know that they changed the president ,  and well that people now are suffering ,  like before ,  like always .   Because there aren't jobs ,  that
well there are jobs ,  they have to work really hard and they don't earn ,  they don't earn anything .  No ,  they're always suffering to find
Like ,  for ,  for the government to come ,  people are always bad . 
yes ,  always ,  like ,  it will always see ,  no ,  people who suffer . 
Hmmm ,  hmmm . 
Above all the majority of people are the common people no ,  because people who have money ,  there
Well yes . 
I think that are going to be more favorable to change ,  many times . 
yes ,  tell me about Fujimoral ,  yes ,  what happened with him . 
Ah ,  Fujimori ,  and he ,  a long time ago ,  yeah ,  he got out of there ,  and now he's not ,  he escaped to Japan
Ah , 
He took refuge in Japan because they denounced him . 
I remember that they hit him in the end ,  since he went ,  they hit him from the state ,  since he went how he went . 
Hmm ,  I think yes ,  the truth is I don't remember ,  since I wasn't there
Ah ,  aha ,  aha
No ,  and
And ,  he went ,  he fled to ? 
No ,  of course ,  because they ,  they had bought what was really a ,  uh ,  a corrupt policy ,  so ,  the thing is ,  he stole money ,  money from
Uh
Right ?  ,  from the country ,  something like that ,  so ,  uh
Yes
so ,  uh ,  they sued him ,  they wanted to ,  uh ,  put him in jail
Right ,  right
But well ,  he fled ,  he sought political refuge in Japan ,  so
Oh
I believe he's been there up to this day
so the Japanese are protecting him
Yes
And ,  and ,  how did a Japanese man ever got to Peru ? 
Well ,  he's nor really Japanese ,  he's Peruvian
Right ,  but of Japanese descent
But he has ,  i mean ,  he's from Japanese descent ,  his family is Japanese
Oh ,  and
So ,  now ,  an i guess there must be some clause that ,  since he's son of Japanese
Right ,  right
so you can seek refuge in Japan
Yes ,  maybe ,  maybe
Oh ,  so that's why he ,  he fled to Japan ,  sure ,  right
they give him citizenship or something like that ,  right ,  and ,  but ,  ¿are there many immigrants from Japan to Peru ? 
Yes ,  more or less
Oh ,  yes
Uh huh
That's funny ,  and ,  and
Yes ,  there are lots of Asian people in Peru ,  that have ,  uh ,  they're like very traders there ,  they have their
Right
their place ,  a very big place ,  where they have their stores and they expor  they import things from Japan or China ,  or
Uh um
From Asian countries ,  and they have there
¿And what kind are there more of ?  ,  or aren't there
Business
¿it's more or less a bit of anything ,  without anyone being the principal ? 
Well ,  countries like that
From Asian countries ,  there are some that dom 
Yeah ,  there are lots of Chinese
Right
There are lots of Chinese in Peru
Uh huh ,  uh huh
Chinese and Japanese also ,  of course . 
Aha
No ,  and Koreans
Oh ,  and is that something recent ,  or a historic thing since a long time ago ? 
Well I think that's been a long time ,  right ,  that they started to immigrate . 
Aha ,  aha
no ,  is not ,  is not recent ,  it's been a long time . 
Hm mm ,  hm mm
yes ,  because they already ,  I mean their generations ,  there are already that are Peruvians right . 
Ah ,  aha
No ,  but well . 
Aha ,  and what ,  and ,  and but maybe is like the Chinese in the United States ,  that since they have Chinese names ,  and since they look Chinese ,  one keeps thinking of them as Chinese . 
Sure ,  I mean ,  they are different places ,  but well ,  one really doesn't know why they have their facial features ,  so similar . 
yes yes yes ,  yes . 
Then ,  it's really not known if ,  if is Korean ,  if is Vietnamese
Aha ,  aha yes . 
or if he's Chinese ,  Japanese
yes ,  yes yes yes ,  because one ,  doesn't distinguish
Something like that
the difference like that Perhaps the Vietnamese ,  one ,  one distinguishes them faster . 
Hm ,  sure . 
But ,  eh ,  between Chinese and Japanese and Koreans ,  I don't distinguish . 
yes ,  you really can't distinguish ,  they have ,  and are very similar . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes
Aha
Look ,  and ,  thinking of what famous Peruvian I know ,  eh ,  I'm thinking of Mario Vargas Llosas . 
Ah ,  yes ,  him ,  but he is not Peruvian ,  he became a nationalized Spaniard . 
Ah yes ,   how and why ? 
No ,  really ,  I don't know because maybe he doesn't like it ,  but
It could be because of the politic ,  because I remember that he started
Hm
quite to the left , 
No
and later ,  through the
yes ,  he even ,  even ran for the presidency of the country . 
that ,  oh yes ,  I remember that ,  and never knew
Hm
the details of ,  of ,  of ,  I only knew that ,  without ,  without any detail ,  of ,  of ,  of
Hm mm
eh ,  that and and and he got close to winning ,  or never had a chance to win . 
Well ,  yes yes there were many many people who favored it ,  no ,  it was really very prominent ,  when he part  when he postulated . 
Aha
No ,  but yes but he lost .   Well ,  like ,  since he had recently entered ,  he hadn't been in politics long ,  everyone knew him as a writer ,  no ,  but it's different than being a ,  me being a writing ,  or being a
Sure
a politician
Ah ,  aha ,  aha
So ,  even though he was very famous ,  and this is why he won many votes , 
Ah ,  aha ,  aha ,  yes . 
No ,  but ,  he didn't win the presidency . 
Aha .   And after this he moved to Spain ? 
yes ,  after he went to Spain ,  and had some problem ,  something like that ,  after . 
Where ,  in Peru ,  or in Spain ? 
Yes ,  he became a Spanish national . 
Ah
And now ,  now he lives in Spain ,  but I think that he will always go to Peru ,  something like that ,  because he has family ,  his family is Peruvian . 
yes ,  you don't renounce your own country
Sure
so it's like that . 
Well ,  yes ,  well people have different feelings
yes
they think different things ,  like everywhere ,  like here to the policy isn't ,  umm ,  very good let's say ,  everyone favors his
Aha
What's convenient for him ,  no . 
Hmm ,  hmm ,  yes . 
No ,  every ,  Bush favors the rich more who are his common people . 
yes
No ,  and it doesn't seem that ,  that many people agree .   When  he was reelected and everything ,  it's always ,  eh ,  many
yes
he's making a lot of mistakes . 
yes ,  and compared to here there are two parties and in other countries there are many countries ,  for example ,  in Peru ,  how many principle parties are there ? 
Well ,  there are also the democrats and the republicans there too ,  no . 
Ah ,  only two ? 
The others ,  yes ,  like ,  there are several parties , 
Aha
it's not like the left and the right ,  they're called more
Hm
No ,  or ,  and the democratic party ,  I don't know ,  where and the liberal party ,  there's ,  I know ,  there's about four parties that are most prominent ,  and there are other smaller ones
Ah
there there are always
And today ,  what party is in the government ? 
Hmmm
No ,  what party is in the government in Peru today ? 
Hmm ,  Aye ,  I don't even know .   I know that it's Toledo ,  but I don't know what party this would be . 
Aha ,  aha .   And how's this president ,  do they see him well or do they still feel like he's not helping ? 
No ,  it's the ,  the crisis is there as always ,  no . 
Hmm
No ,  it's always really like it's a country ,  eh ,  like from the third world ,  it's like an underdeveloped country ,  so
Hmm
There are always problems ,  and everything ,  like there are so many problems here too .   There are people who suffer a lot ,  and also
Ah yes yes
they go hungry ,  there they also go hungry . 
Ah ,  I would say more than here . 
Sure ,  like ,  here you ,  you're surprised thinking that it's a very advanced country ,  and you come here ,  and you say ,  well not really ,  you will meet people who are beggars or something like that
But you find them everywhere
yes ,  yes ,  it's a shame really
Aha
yes ,  and ,  hmm what's it called ,  and Peru em ,  tell me a little big about the regions of Peru ,  and what regions it's divided into . 
Well ,  it's Peru ,  it's divided into ,  the coast ,  the sierra ,  eh ,  the parts of the mountains ,  and the jungle . 
Aha
There's a lot of jungle . 
Aha eh
no ,  em ,  the Amazon ,  and there's the Amazon river ,  so . 
Hmm
No ,  that goes to Brazil . 
Aha ,  aha
So ,  eh ,  no ,  there they don't have the three regions . 
How pretty it must be ,  it must give this so much diversity . 
Hmm yes ,  really yes there are many ,  there are ,  well in the sierras ,  above all you can see the descendants of the Inca ,  they're still there ,  there are people who are pure Indian ,  what are they called
Hmm ,  no ,  I was going to ask what ,  how many in 
No ,  that no
indigenous
Hmmm
I lived in Guatemala for many years ,  and in Guatemala there's still a large indigenous population
yes ,  I know ,  aha
em ,  that still ,  eh ,  eh ,  that
Well the majority in Peru ,  the majority have crossed ,  and are mestizos as they're called . 
Aha
No ,  but there are some small ,  small groups that are still descendants from the indigenous ,  and they're conserved there and after ,  well ,  in the jungle of course ,  there are these native groups . 
Ah yes
No ,  the native groups that still live there . 
Like aborigines ? 
yes ,  aborigines ,  ah . 
Ah
Sure ,  including ,  like ,  the Amazonian jungle ,  it's a very very deep jungle ,  and you really don't know who lives there
Hmm
There are human groups that are unknown . 
How interesting ,  hmm
No and yes ,  but the majority are people ,  no ,  the majority are like ,  they're called ,  civilized
Hmm
No ,  they're interracial people who live in the sierra ,  in the jungle ,  there are also cities in the jungle too . 
Aha aha
No ,  there are small ,  small indigenous groups ,  but the majority are interracial ,  Spanish crossed with Indians .   Hmm
Aha aha yes ,  Well ,  and are you an American citizen ? 
No ,  I'm a resident
Who can ,  ah resident ,  yes ,  because you have to be a resident for five years yes ,  and ,  what do the Latinos in Atlanta think about politics here in the United States ? 
Aye ,  well ,  I don't know ,  the majority ,  I don't think that the majority really agree ,  above all for the undocumented people who are here
Ah ,  why ,  why don't they restrict them ? 
Sure ,  well here the ,  here in Georgia the undocumented people can't drive ,  they can't have ,  well they drive ,  but they drive because they want to drive ,  they can buy a car ,  drive ,  and I don't know how they do it ,  but anyway
They can't have ,  no ,  licen

oh
ah ,  places that they use for camping ,  or for weekend activities they are using them as temporary housing . 
yeah
but I think that the majority of the people have decided not to return to New Orleans because since they are so unstable and they couldn't fix the dams and they don't know if there's another flood and the same thing will happen . 
mm
many people have decided that they are not going to return .

hello ,  ah ,  what's your name ?   eh ,  what's your name ?   eh sorry
hi it doesn't matter ,  Any ,  yes
Any ,  I'm Pilar ,  I think that we've talked once before

fine fine ,  and you ? 
who is it ? 
eh what do  yes
where are you calling from ?   ah ,  I'm calling from Miami
from New York ,  hmm ,  what do you think about religion ?   what these people said ,  do you think it divides people or not ? 
it depends I think that if you have the same ,  ehh ,  the language or thoughts that the other person has but if they're different I think it divides ,  of course ,  because
if you're Christian ,  and the other is Jewish and the other is Muslim ,  I don't remember how you say it in Spanish ,  they won't have the
Muslim ,  eh ,  Muslim
aha ,  they won't have the same ,  you know ,  religion or the same idea or whatever
yes but you think that this divides people ,  you think that the fact of having a different religion that they can't at least
be friends or get along well
no ,  what I want to say is that they can be friends and they can get a lot but when the topic of religion of course they will be ,  you know ,  divided because they don't believe in the same
but I don't think that if you know ,  if a person is Christian ,  another person is Jewish ,  that they can't be friends ,  of course
hmm
this is also something personal because some people aren't like this either ,  you know
yes . 
because they believe that if you are not what you know ,  if not ,  if you don't believe what they believe well then
or that it's not so much in your opinion ,  not is so much the religion that divides but rather the people themselves that use religion ,  at best
in some way more ,  more extreme or more no ,  and to separate from society or from people of other religions . 
yes ,  yes . 
no ,  or I mean the religion itself ,  or at least the religion ,  religions that I'm familiar with teach you to be tolerant ,  teach you to be ,  to be good
right ? 
yes
They don't teach ah ,  that the people from other religions should be despised or that they don't deserve to live or anything like that ,  right ? 
yes
religion doesn't teach you that ,  and yet there are people ,  those who are very extreme and interpret it that way
yes ,  but it's true ,  but also I believe that if it ,  eh ,  you know ,  if you are so ,  um ,  talking on the theme of religion ,  or whatever ,  you know
so then this is what divides also ,  because I can't let's say if ,  if I am Jewish and I can't say if I believe what you believe
or I eh ,  eh think the same as what you think if you are a Christian ,  because they aren't ,  you know
yes
they are not the same religion in that way ,  but at the same time you know ,  I believe that
yes but this isn't a reason for division ,  the fact that this ,  in all the themes ,  people have distinct opinions ,  distinct beliefs ,  and this doesn't
Does not have to bring any problem to anyone ,  you know ?  No division . 
yes ,  yes and no but what I want to say that if it's worth living because I can't ,  you can't have your opinion because what I want to say that we are not going to
be equal ,  if we are not equal we are not united ,  so then we are divided ,  you understand ? 
well it also depends on if you're referring to being divided ,  like ,  I think that the fact that people have different religions and different beliefs ,  well
that if everyone were equal ,  I don't think that there would be fewer problems ,  it would be boring
yes
but being divided also ,  like ,  in my opinion refers more to the fact that people don't speak to each other ,  there aren't problems in
that society is divided into groups of people who have different religions and fight between themselves like has happened ,  has happened in history like keeps happening now ,  this is why I refer to the division
yes ,  no
the fact ,  the fact that people living in the same country have different beliefs ,  and they can get along well ,  I don't see any problem ,  no ? 
no no no this ,  you know ,  because I don't think that I can tell someone how to live or what to
believe ,  this is something that you know ,  they have to ,  eh ,  you know ,  I can't think of the word ,  eh
hmm
it's something that the person has to do himself ,  his own decision ,  you know ,  it's not something that I can say to someone
you have to believe this ,  you have to believe that
sure but no
so you know
well it depends on the in  on how easy it is to influence this person because in the end when we're kids
yes
the religions are instilled in us ,  and tell us that you have to believe this ,  and as kids we're very impressionable
yes
they believe it
yes
ah what else it said in the topic
oh I don't know I never understand him
yes I heard is that
he is very hard for me ,  I just hear
not hear the message was terrible ,  terribly said I hardly hear it but I did understand something else but is that I don't remember what he has said ,  ah I don't remember
well ,  eh we can talk about something else it doesn't have to be the topic
no no it does have to be about the topic if it's not the topic the call is not valid
no I read the instructions and they said that the topic is to help you but one doesn't necessarily have to talk about the topic
ah really
because I ,  I had a lot of problems once with a person that couldn't connect ,  we couldn't talk and I read the instructions and that's what they said
ah well ah yes yes
so that pardon
no keep on keep on that you get cut ,  keep on
eh ,  but if you prefer we can talk ,  keep talking about the topic if
ah I don't care is that I thought ,  I had read that if you don't talk of the topic it doesn't count ,  the call doesn't count ,  that if you talked of something else it didn't count
that's why ,  that's why I always try to talk about the topic
okay ,  well so let's continue with the topic because
but no
what I said ,  I read it because I thought that it was that it said something like that if those know that these conversations are very eh
abnormal so to speak then they give you the topic to help you
yes of course
when I have eh talked with the other people eh
not always ,  not always do we talk about the topic
we talk yes the other day I talked with a guy from New York who was a cop
yes
and we spent the whole time talking of you know his job because I found it very interesting but eh
but the calls you don't know yet ,  is that
I don't know I think that the only reason if the call is valid or not valid is if you have talked for twelve minutes
mm
is what I think which that has happened to me many times ,  well it has happened like four times that I'm talking with a person and the call gets cut off
ah yes it hasn't happened to me
yes oh what happened to me yesterday was that they called me and told me okay wait on the line for the other participant and then suddenly they tell me bye and hung up on me
and me okay
no no that hasn't happened to me
so
and well anyways returning to the topic ,  are you then religious or not ?  or you don't have any religion ? 
ambitious
religious
oh um I don't think of myself as religious I you know read the bible ,  go to church ,  eh you know pray with my family but for me a
a religious person ,  is a person that has many rules ,  many eh
well ,  what I mean is that is if you have a religion or not ,  tht's what I mean
yes ,  I think I do ,  yes
eh ,  but what are you ?  are you Catholic or what ? 
Christian ,  mm
Christian ,  and what do you think about the other religions then ?  what do you think about Muslims ?  do you believe in God ?  oh now I remembered what the subject was about ,  I just remembered
whether we believe that religions are actually different ways of seeing the same thing ,  for instance jewish ,  Muslims and Christians
they all pretend the same ,  they are based in the same book ,  well they are not based in it but Jewish and Christians are in the old Testament
and Muslims do have also an Old Testament as a part of their religion
mhm
it's funny ,  isn't it ?  so ,  how do you see that ?  would you say it's three different ways of ,  ah ,  actually adoring the same God ? 
it's more or less the same ,  isn't it ? 
well I think that ,  to start with the Jewish ,  that the Bible ,  the first part of the Bible ,  the Old Testament
yes ,  mhm ,  yes
is the same thing that thy believe in ,  I think that if it was not for the Old Testament
listen
¿Hi ? 
¿Hello ? 
Hi
Hi
I'm Miguel Angel ,  ¿who are you ? 
Oh ,  José
¿José ? 
Yes ,  José
Hi ,  ¿and where are you ? 
Uh ,  in Philadelphia
Oh ,  me too
Oh ,  you too ,  no i think ,  you work at ,  uh ,  ¿are you a student at Penn ? 
Yes too ,  yes ,  in Penn
Of ,  it was Biology ,  ¿wasn't it ? 
No ,  no ,  of Chemistry ,  yes ,  yes
No ,  Chemistry ,  yes ,  i have spoken to you before
Oh ,  oh ,  we talked ,  that's true ,  we talked the other day ,  ¿right ? 
Yes ,  yes
Yes ,  that you're doing Economy ,  ¿right ? 
Exactly ,  exactly
Yes .  How are you ? 
Fine ,  fine here ,  just doing a little bit of homework ,  of math and
Aha . 
and they called ,  then yeah well ,  why not rest a little ,  right ? 
Sure ,  me too ,  they have also called me ,  yes they called me yesterday and I couldn't couldn't accept the call because I was busy ,  and today I say ,  well
Eh
well I'm going to talk a while
Yes ,  yes ,  no because
Very good ,  sure . 
because that's at six in the evening .  Eh ,  eh ,  of the afternoon ,  and ,  and at nine ,  right ,  and if one doesn't get it ,  already ,  is hard
Yes ,  sometimes well there are days that they call you twice .  I
to find . 
if you don't answer at six ,  perhaps later at seven ,  later at eight they call you again
Eh . 
But yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  and
Sip . 
I sometimes don't want to call myself but but is sure ,  if there's no other person waiting for the call ,  well ,  sure ,  no ,  . 
Eh .  No ,  but the problem with ,  with that of six is that that ,  because I talk on the cellular phone ,  then I have a limit of how much I can talk during the day . 
Ah ,  okay . 
and ,  eh ,  then is a bit annoying ,  but , 
Ah ,  but I think that this call is free
eh ,  yes ,  this no 
I mean they don't charge you anything ,  no ?  But this call
No ,  no ,  well ,  well ,  they don't charge me but there is a limi  I  I have six hundred minutes each month
Ah ,  yeah ,  independent from the number you call
And ,  Exactly ,  yes ,  yes .  So ,  because I don't have a land line
Aha
so ,  like that ,  normal ,  like from from home ,  it's just a ,  a cell  phone ,  it's the ,  the only thing I have
Yeah ,  yeah You don't have a line
Yes
Do  why ,  where are you living ,  in a college ? 
I don't have a land line ,  no ,  no ,  no .  Only a cell . 
Yeah ,  yeah , 
Yes . 
but where are you living ,  e  eh  college house or , 
Oh . 
in a dorm ,  or
Yes ,  well ,  in a fraternity house . 
Pardon ?  A fraternity ?  Ah . 
I  in a yes ,  yes ,  so no ,  here there's a public phone . 
Yeah . 
Below . 
And you don't have a phone in the room ? 
And it's the university's .  No ,  I don't have a phone in the room . 
Ah ,  that I believed you had ,  ah yeah ,  yeah ,  hm mm ,  hm mm ,  yeah
But yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  it almost doesn't matter any more ,  because
No ,  with the phones ,  yes
now almost every one yes ,  yes ,  now almost every one that I ,  I know that that lives ,  well that only lives in the dorms one has a line ,  right ,  but
all the same ,  the people ,  every one has cell phones , 
Everyone
all those who live
every one has ,  how ,  how do you call them here ,  cells
all , all the students that
in Spain we call it mobile
Sure ,  the mobiles ,  ah , 
Yes ,  mobiles .  But ,  both ,  if it's mobile the cell ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
Yes .  Yes ,  no . 
Everyone has it .  Yeah .  And it's not necessary to have a phone pre ,  pre fixed yeah
No ,  no ,  and also ,  every one that lives ,  um ,  like in an apartment that ,  like that ,  that ,  that ,  that doesn't ,  that doesn't ,  that doesn't live in the dorms , 
almost no one has a phone ,  like that a land line . 
Sure ,  because they telephone is really expensive because you have pay ,  eh ,  even if you don't consume ,  even if you don't use it ,  you have to pay a minimum quota .   And besides , 
and then ,  after if you have the cell ,  well ,  because ,  no ,  and many people don't use nu 
So ,  exactly . 
they're never at home ,  and prefer people to call the cell ,  and , 
Yes . 
This happened to me ,  I have ,  I have a land line ,  but the truth is that I give the same ,  and I don't know why I have it ,  because
Yes . 
because I never use it
No ,  no ,  a land line is good ,  for example ,  if you have a family and it's a home ,  there are several people ,  and
Yeah .   Sure
you ,  eh ,  because
Sure
you will need so  something right ,  on the phone ,  and maybe several people want to get on the phone , 
Sure ,  I also keep the telephone you know why ,  because
I don't know but ,  yes . 
if I want to call my family in Spain ,  it's much cheaper . 
Ah . 
to call them from a land line than from a cell phone ,  you know .   S 
And ,  but ,  and do you use the ,  the calling cards ? 
Ah ,  yes .   yes ,  I started to use it this call but you know what happens ,  every time I call yes
Ah
Then ,  I'm calling Spain less and less every day ,  then it's almost not worth it ,  you now ,  to buy a card that maybe will expire soon
Ah ,  that's true ,  that's true
the balance ,  or
It's true ,  it's true
you know .  At first ,  I did buy them ,  yes ,  yes .  Because I called a lot .  But now I don't call that often to ,  eh ,  to Spain
But ,  the calls ,  the calls to Spain must be almost free ,  right ,  with the ,  with the phone card .  I guess
I see .  Well ,  it's not .  It's cheap .  I think that ,  well ,  look .  About the phone ,  I'm living in Samson Place ,  well
Because ,  uhm ,  well ,  I lived in France ,  because I studied in France for a few months .  So when I was there
Yeah ,  yeah
my mom used to call me
yes
And it was ,  say .  I was three cents a minute ,  two cents a minute
I think that's it
But
one ,  one eight ,  the minute
Hm
One eight ,  what happens is that you have to add taxes later ,  of course
yes
So ,  it will be ,  it will be two ,  or two and four cents ,  something like that
Yes ,  it is incredible
Two forty ,  something like that .  It is not much ,  the truth ,  I don´t know so ,  but if that is land telephone ,  of course ,  because if you use the cell phone ,  then it is much more expensive
Yes ,  yes ,  no and
Still ,  it is still more expensive the cell phone ,  yes
No ,  it is incredible ,  because ,  um ,  we call from Guatemala ,  because there because my dad my dad lives in Guatemala ,  and
Of course ,  of course . 
it is ,  it is ,  incredible that
Hmm hmm
ten years ago .  We paid sixty cents for ,  for ,  for every minute . 
For a minute ,  yes ,  yes . 
yes .  And now ,  we are paying fifteen cents . 
Yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
It is incredible . 
but well ,  that makes sense ,  because of course ,  television has got cheaper the telephone because because because permanent phones loose territory against the cell phone . 
Then ,  to ,  to make it still , 
Yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
attractive ,  to people use them ,  Well ,  they are cheaper
Yes . 
Because of course ,  it is the only way that they have to people do not throw the telephone in the trash
No ,  no ,  yes ,  yes  , yes . 
and everybody uses cellular ,  you know . 
No , no ,  and also ,  it helps a lot of progress in the psychology and all that ,  and they've been able to ,  for example ,  and ,  someone was telling me ,  I don't know if it's true ,  but ,  for example ,  um
casting use now ah the computers and the Internet a lot . 
Yes ,  yes .  For calls ,  yes . 
to take the ,  for ,  for ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  for the calls .  And for example ,  uh ,  now there is for example ,  something they call the ,  uh ,  Voice
Then one has a phone ,  that one connects to the computer
Hm True ,  true
and ,  yes ,  then one ,  answers .  And is as if it was a normal telephone ,  right .  One has a tone ,  one calls and is
That is ,  that is . 
Yes ,  but . 
But the call is through the internet ,  and it doesn't cost ,  yes
yes ,  yes ,  exactly ,  exactly .  And that same technology is the technology that it's used right .  The companies are using it .  Them uh perhaps one doesn't connect one's phone to the computer .  But when it gets there , 
they transmit through  perhaps is only of the internet right ,  but , 
That is . 
is some similar mechanism ,  right .  Then they transmit
Sure
in their network much more efficiently . 
Yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  perfect . 
And also ,  there's been well I know that since eh ,  in the last fifteen twenty years ,  there's been a lot of deregulation of ,  of all
Hm
Well ,  of all the utilities here in the United States . 
Mm hmm . 
But ,  and ,  and in Guatemala ,  I know that also ,  for example ,  privatization of ,  they privatized Guatel ,  which was a telephone company .  So then
uh huh ,  uh huh .  Yes ,  or if ,  what can you do ,  of course . 
with everything ,  with all of this there has been many technological advances
Of course ,  the monopolies ,  right ,  right ,  right . 
now private enterprise is big .  If ,  m  now there is more private enterprise overall ,  bast  but more efficient in general ,  true ,  but it seems that
they have ,  they have been able to do it much more efficiently .  So then
Hm
It has become very cheap . 
Yes ,  in Spain pa  in Spain the same thing happened . 
Hm . 
Yes ,  ah ,  yes ,  yes .  With the Telephone monopoly
Mm hm . 
Because Telephones was a public company
Hm
And ,  then when they privatized ,  well ,  I'm not sure ,  it's not ,  I don't know if they had privatized everything .  I believe that now yes ,  they have privatized it all . 
But both gave ,  gave rise to the possibility that there would be competition . 
Mm hm ,  mm hm . 
From other ,  from other telephone companies ,  and ,  and other companies came in ,  well ,  not that they came in ,  it's that they created telephone companies in Spain besides the Telephone . 
Yes . 
And "Telefonica" begun to low the prices because they had competence .  Before ,  like they were the only ones , 
Yes . 
well ,  they could charge what they wanted you know . 
Yes ,  yes ,  yes .  Well
And ,  of course . 
Yes ,  yes ,  what has happened in Spain in the last I don´t know well ,  since the ,  eh ,  got into the European community ,  it has been incredible ,  because
I would say ,  fifteen ,  twenty years .  Yes
and ,  and ,  "Telefonica" . 
Hmm .  Yes ,  yes
now the ,  now many Spanish companies ,  Spanish have invested abroad ,  specially in Latin America ,  Specially "telefonica" ,  because the market ,  of Spain
it has became more difficult ,  right .  There is ,  there is more competence and it is a more mature market ,  then
Of course ,  it is more difficult . 
they are in Latin ,  Latin ,  Latin America where still nobody has a cell phone , there are many   many possibilities . 
Of course ,  there are more ,  there are more possibilities of business because the market is not so saturated yet
And in Guatemala   Exactly ,  exactly .  And ,  and ,  there are many Spanish companies that have invested a lot ,  much money and and in countries like Poland too and
Aha . 
The Czech Republic ,  also ,  many ,  specially Poland ,  many Spanish companies
That is true . 
have invested
Yes
yes ,  in these economies .   It's very interesting . 
And it's true that Telefonica is now everywhere
Yes ,  it's true . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes
No I ha  I ,  well ,  I well ,  two years ago ,  I helped a Spanish professor , 
Hmmm
here ,  in the university ,  with the investigations he was doing . 
Aha . 
And well ,  I though that it was ,  he told me to look for data on ,  so he gave me different companies . 
Aha
So ,  for example ,  Prosegur ,  this was one of the companies ,  so I had ,  it's an insurance company .   So I had to go on the internet to see
all the annual reports that they had ,  and to see what their investments were . 
Ah ,  well ,  this is ,  this is interesting ,  right ? 
And yes ,  so ,  so I went ,  true ,  I learned that many ,  a lot of Spanish companies ,  and what they were doing , 
Hmmm ,  hmmm . 
no ,  but ,  Yes ,  well yes .   The , 
yes ,  but surely ,  it's a really big company in Spain . 
No ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes .   No ,  and there ,  e 
Security and of ,  yes ,  yes yes ,  the
Yes ,  but now ,  in the end when it was ,  in eighty seven that that ,  Spain became part of the European community ,  yeah
In ,  in eighty six . 
In eighty six ,  since then ,  it seems that companies say ,  well ,  all of a sudden they have more competition ,  and ,  and they have , 
Ah ,  yes ,  yes ,  no . 
they feel like forced right ,  because of course that one wants to continue
It has been a total change . 
If one want to continue all of a sudden ,  they started to to ,  to ,  invest abroad ,  yes . 
Huh ,  Right ,  right . 
Eh ,  yes . 
Well ,  it has been a very big change that Spain has had ,  and economic ,  of course .  That's undeniable ,  but social too eh . 
Hm
Social too ,  I mean
It's true ,  it's true . 
socio  the way of thinking ,  the people ,  more openness ,  you know I don't know ,  I mean ,  more ,  I mean
Yes ,  it's true .  No ,  no ,  I . 
I ha  has changed very fast
Yes ,  I imagine that
Sure ,  sure
yes ,  yes one compares to the t  to the times of Franco ,  socially it's
Sure . 
has changed a lot
No ,  no ,  no ,  a total change ,  a total change ,  yes . 
Yes ,  yes . 
yes ,  yes .   And well ,  in the ,  in the ,  eh ,  the topic of religion that is what they suppose here ,  is that they suppose that we should talk about this 
Ah ,  yes yes
well in Spain ,  believe me ,  the change has been total . 
Hmm
Like ,  the change has been very big .   Like ,  In Spain ,  during Francoism ,  well ,  it's not ,  Catholicism was the principal religion .   NO ,  it's that ,  that he's Catholic
like you could be something else
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
because it was practically ,  not just the official religion ,  but obligatory ,  you know
Hmm
And nevertheless ,  after ,  well ,  when Franco died ,  and ,  in seventy eight the whole Spanish constitution ,  well ,  was given freedom of worship
and everyone could have the religion that they wanted ,  you know .   But ,  with Francoism ,  no ,  in fact the regime is
Like ,  yeah
eh ,  yes
Hello ,  good afternoon
Good afternoon ,  how are you ? 
Good ,  thanks ,  and you ? 
Good ,  I think that we have already spoken before right . 
What ,  where are you ? 
I'm in Atlanta ,  Georgia Norma
Ah ,  Norma ,  how are you ,  I'm Josefina ,  in Philadelphia ,  yes . 
Ah yes yes ,  we spoke before
You remember now aha ,  Yes ,  they're like tuning us around no ,  to  to once again . 
Eh yes ,  I don't think that there are too many participants for sure . 
One round yes yeah that look  it looks like it ,  but
Aha
I ,  I don't care well ,  to chat again we keep going on and on no .  This about religion ouch My God ,  this people . 
Yes ,  I suppose that you're religious ,  as a good Latin woman or not . 
Ah yes
Of course , 
I am I came back Eh ,  I have been sure ,  one has times in her life a bit like ,  forgetful ,  that
Sure ,  aha
very young ,  but now ah ,  God ,  now I ,  it soothes me a lot .  To pray and that ,  like
Hmm mm
I don't know about you but I'm Catholic ,  well we do have lots of people that are Catholics here too .  Others are from different areas of Christianity and not all
Yes ,  I  mean ,  well ,  I believe there's a God ,  it's only that there are differences in the process that people follow to worship God ,  no . 
Aha , 
The different religions ,  the different denominations . 
Yes ,  yes there are many . 
No ,  really and we ,  one really unifies with a religion ,  it unites people because even ,  when there are natural disasters ,  it doesn't matter which religion you have . 
Oh yes
but people help each other . 
That's right ,  it's like
Hm mm
everybody gets together and they start ,  praying or ,  to
Sure ,  I mean ,  it's
in their own words ,  they each use their words . 
and you can realize that religion unites the people because you ,  during a moment of suffering
in a disaster ,  one
Oh look ,  yes . 
you always look for God's help . 
Yes ,  sure ,  and I've already
You always turn to him
like ,  if you have children ,  when one gets sick ,  it's like oh my God
Right
When you feel the thing's hard
Sure ,  you always
Yeah ,  you have to
You always
trust
You always know there's a superior being that's gonna help us ,  ¿right ?  ,  and
Yes ,  of course
you go to it's mercy
and how's ,  ¿how's the situation there right now ?  ,  the weather and all that
¿Where ,  here in Atlanta ,  Georgia ? 
Oh ,  right ,  ¿oh yes ? 
Yes ,  i mean ,  more or less ,  right ,  like it always is ,  always the crisis ,  the gas has increased a lot and
Right ,  there comes this thing that ,  right ,  oh my god
Yes ,  the gas has increased a lot ,  three dollars thirty ,  something like that ,  the regular
Right
No ,  and ,  uh
And it's being spent
Sure ,  and people ,  well
And it wears away quickly
Now there's one that they're looking after others ,  some ,  uh
uh ,  uh
alternatives ,  ¿right ?  ,  to driving ,  or car pooling or something like that
They're selling here ,  i see lots of people who have large vans
Yes
the new ,  pretty ones ,  but ,  they put them on sale
Oh ,  oh ,  they're selling those ,  sure ,  because they consume lots of gas ,  really
For sale ,  oh
you spend a lot on gas
they turn
uh huh
or ,  money runs like water
That's true ,  the people really hasn't had much ,  and they say "oh ,  i have s little ,  I'm gonna save"
Right
And in the end ,  they don't save anything
They go
Yes ,  yes ,  you think you're saving and in the end ,  it turns away and the money is over
You get ,  uh ,  yeah ,  you get in a bad mood
Yeah ,  right
Because ,  instead of spending ten ,  you spent twenty five ,  and such ,  where you're going to do
Sure
If one goes out to buy something ,  you always remember that you missed something ,  then
Hm mm
ah me
Yes ,  in small things ,  even if one doesn't feel it ,  later already
Yes ,  I don't know and so hard already for money to come in ,  right .  It goes out fast ,  but nothing ,  to come in you have to look for it ,  really look for it .

No ,  it's already like ,  like autumn already of
It's already getting cold here too .  Yes ,  the mornings are very cold .

so , 
Much violence ,  really in this world no
yes ,  I don't understand . 
And ,  and besides ,  so what do you think about homosexuality there ,  with respect to religion ,  because it seems that many religions reject homosexuals ,  or don't want to
give them freedom ,  that according to them they don't need it . 
I say that I have two ,  two tendencies in this aspect .   Sometimes I like ,  sure ,  that they help everyone in the world to be equal ,  and that everyone has the same opportunities . 
Hmm
But ,  at the same time ,  I see that these people who are ,  that ,  that in reality ,  they're disoriented
Hmmm
and at best are perverse , 
No ,  this is true . 
and at best they will hurt someone ,  hmm ? 
Aha ,  yes ,  this is true ,  there's always
I get a like radical on that ,  of being more strict ,  right ?  ,  the people selection ,  right ? 
the problem is that I used to live in Los  Angeles ,  in a neighborhood beside the gay district
Oh ,  OK
No .  And form my window I could see other buildings where the gays lived in .  And they used to cry a lot at night
Hm mm
they were there ,  well dressed in their suits and ties ,  but
Hm mm
they were suffering .  I remember I did that comment .  Oh , m but that people is unhappy
Sure ,  because ,  I mean ,  they feel rejected by the society they live in ,  like they don't .  . 
And they look so fine ,  but yeah
they can do anything ,  because ,  due to their sexual tendencies
They are criticized ,  exactly
Yes ,  no ,  and now it is
They ,  got together themselves ,  and instead of laughing they were crying .  And I thought ,  oh well ,  is this people never gonna be happy ? 
Because they used to make parades ,  you know ,  they went out embraced
Hm mm
parading on the streets
Sure
But yet ,  they were somehow rebels ,  sad ,  I don't know
Sure ,  I mean ,  sometimes I
Eh
I think that there are times ,  a situation ,  very ,  no ,  very terrible for them ,  no . 
I think so ,  because
Yes ,  well ,  and also ,  no ,  yes ,  I agree that really how they say get married or this issue ,  because natural
hmmm ,  hmmm ,  you want
No ,  no not that they ,  like ,  get married ,  an issue ,  yes ,  no ,  yeah this would be ,  this is too
I don't understand ,  yes . 
to ,  to too extreme .   Like ,  for each one here that each one has their freedom ,  no one gives them ,  there are people who are really born
This is the thing . 
so ,  they don't have these ,  these tendencies ,  this karma ,  what's it called ,  from
Of being ,  eh ,  changing things . 
sure ,  like of passing ,  eh ,  for this kind of suffering no ,  agree with
It's I saw a
no ,  their activities
I don't remember if it was a new or some article . 
Hmmm
and there was a school for gay kids ,  who know that ,  they have this since they're little ,  and they're
These inclinations ,  an yes ,  ah ,  I didn't know this . 
they feel good ,  yes ,  they said that they felt completely satisfied in this school ,  because no one bullied or anything . 
Ah ,  yes , 
And and that is what I see ,  that if for example I'm in their way of being ,  and they like it like   between themselves , 
well I don't know if
Hm mm
if they should ,  keep on insisting in belonging to others that ,  that are mixed .  I don't know .  I think that would be worth studying a lot right . 
Yes ,  it really is a very delicate topic no . 
of course . 
Well is that I think no ,  that God is for everybody ,  it doesn't matter that the people are gays ,  that are
Ah I
that have different denominations ,  or
Yes ,  if they are good
rich or poor ,  or whatever they are .  . 
aha
No ,  pe 
They are good people ,  are good friends ,  I know that
Sure ,  eh ,  one well Aha
that there are very good people .  I like to associate with everybody ,  but
Hm mm
if they are going to be in a place ,  they are going to be treating them bad and all that ,  well
Sure ,  I mean ,  that already is
I don't think
part of the karma of each person no ,  because one is born ,  I ,  we believe in one
aha . 
religion that believes in the in the law of karma .  I don't know if you've ever heard about that . 
Yes ,  of the Buddhists . 
Yes ,  I'm ,  I belong to the ,  a Hindu religion . 
Ah okay . 
Then we believe in the karma .  Each person has a yes ,  a reaction for the positive or negative activities that
Yes
that one does . 
yes ,  in the past and in the
No ,  then that ,  the case of the gays ,  is ,  is a type of karma ,  that they come to this world to suffer no . 
aha
For their past activities . 
Ah very interesting . 
Then ,  each one like that has their ,  their reaction ,  is yes ,  in this case the gays ,  they suffer for that ,  no ,  that the society rejects them or something . 
For some negative activity that they did in their past life . 
They would have to feel ,  to feel satisfied because if they understood no ,  their karma and their ,  their way of passing this life . 
Sure ,  and that ,  I mean ,  the problems live this life as positive as possible ,  no ,  according
Hm mm ,  mm mm
within the ,  I mean ,  within their groups ,  of them ,  how they are called ,  no ,  and is
I say put when they insist
doing the more positive things ,  so that en the next life ,  good ,  they're not suffering like this like now
Yes ,  I don't know of your ,  of your religious practices ,  if there is some rejection of homosexuals or not
Well ,  really there is not a rejection because it's not ,  exactly a rejection no
Hm
But always ,  there always is a group of people that know that your religion there exists a group of people that really that ostracize a
little ,  a topic like that
Well if you are of the family ,  of the family
Clearly ,  or ,  us here ,  we accept people ,  it doesn't matter what inclinations or activities that they have .  No but ,  there is a process by which one is purified ,  and those
activities ,  inclinations
Clearly , 
No
Em ,  yes ,  that is a thing that
Hm mm
clearly ,  it depends on what the person wants to move ,  if he/she only wants to be affiliated and is going to attend
Clearly ,  there is freedom .  No ,  no one ,  one no ,  one
oh ,  it wants to leave
follow some rules ,  one knows that religion has rules and regulations
Aha
No ,  and in agreement with that ,  if one wants to be devout to God ,  one has to follow rules and regulations ,  not be homoesexual ,  o man or woman ,  because
the same we are all sinful right . 
Sure ,  we all have many
We all sin ,  man ,  woman ,  homosexual or not homosexual ,  the same one sins .  No ,  one
Exactly . 
then  ,  I mean the difference ,  must be in ,  I mean the spiritual foundation that one makes really .  No ,  in
I would like to know
that one develops his devotion to God . 
Yes ,  one want for one's own ,  the best . 
Hm mm
well one doesn't want for one's mind to be distorted ,  then there's where the thing is ,  that one is not going to be as open with
with a person ,  how you treat
Hm mm Sure ,  there's always that distrust ,  no ,  that some
Aha
like are atheists ,  that are homosexuals
That try to influence . 
or that are perverts ,  and attack the children ,  something like that ,  no ,  but that's why you have to have a lot of
Eh
carefulness ,  no ,  and and well ,  see how the person really is , 
That I
Because some people are born with those tendencies ,  and is already their karma of past lives ,  like I tell you again .  Some are born with the tendencies ,  the internal organs ,  see like that
Yes Yes
feminine hormones ,  and all that matter like that . 
The genetic
Sure
There are Yes ,  there are ,  there are they sometimes adopt  kids ,  and all ,  and live
No ,  oh ,  yes yes , 
Hello .

A bit of bad weather is coming here ,  a storm is coming here .   But ,  the weather's already changing here ,  the storm ,  the temperature , 
There there are seasons ,  yes
yes ,  there in Los Angeles you don't see the seasons ,  the change ,  right ? 
Very little
Very little ,  yes
yes ,  a little but not ,  not like there in Denver
yes ,  here you really notice ,  eh ,  the four seasons ,  and well ,  the topic of today is Religion
¿What's your name ? 
My name is Jou ,  Jou Mendez
Jou ,  Jou
Jou
OK
Like José ,  but Jou
Jou
And you're Alex ,  and ,  ¿what's your last name ? 
Oh ,  Tovar
Escobar sic ,  and ,  ¿are you from Mexico or are you from Los Angeles ? 
Yes ,  uh ,  I'm from here ,  from Los Angeles
I'm a lot ,  I'm from Puerto Rico ,  but I've been living here for like twenty six years here in Colorado
Yes
Yes ,  even my daughter was born here and all that ,  ¿do you have a family ? 
Yes ,  I'm from .  .  .  Colombian
Oh ,  that's good
But i have a small family
I have friends from Colombia ,  and well ,  very nice people of good culture and all that ,  i love the music from there too ,  their culture
[It's] Very nice over there ,  ¿have you gone there recently ? 
No ,  a very long ,  long time ago i
yes ,  wow
Many years
How many years ? 
Like twenty
Oh ,  my goodness
I ,  I ,  I consider myself American and I am here because I am forgetting Spanish yes
Yeah ,  to Puerto Rico I have not gone there since since I think that thirteen years ago ,  when my dad died
yes , 
I have not gone ,  and it has changed a lot ,  because each time I see  a picture there is something new ,  they are making new things
Oh ,  yes all change
Change a lot
And what do you think of religion ? 
Well religion I think that Eh ,  today instead of using it to unite people it is been used to divide because of the religion many people is being killed ,  I
Personally I have a big love for God and And I do have my own religion I Can see the religion is so divided these days ,  everywhere
from ,  the religion of the Jews ,  the Muslims ,  the one That is practiced as if it was Christian but I really don´t know ,  so What ,  what the bible teach us and in the true religion ,  well
I think it is not practiced today as it should
yes ,  I ,  I agree a lot with that ,  a lot ah ,  I see much hypocrisy in religion
Me too
a lot and no Well people go to church but the do not Do not practice to themselves ,  to other people
The same
And the people is so religious ,  they are so ,  like I said in Spanish ,  they judge other people
yes ,  quite a lot
They judge you and ah ,  oh ,  I don't know
it's they way the represent it ,  for example ,  it's not that I'm trying to speak badly of the Catholic church but ,  lately ,  lots of things have come to light
about the religious people ,  priests that have done these terrible things and have abused young people and done inappropriate things and now this is coming to light because it was kept hidden for a long time ,  people knew what was happening
Happening but now it is coming to light and all those claims that have been filed everywhere ,  here in Colorado there's one from eight people
This happened in the seventies
yes , 
and they are ,  the man that did this ,  the priest ,  he died but there's so much people speaking about what he did back then
the now ,  they have a good basis to file the claim against the Catholic church ,  but just like the Catholic church ,  other religions
that claim to follow God ,  they still ,  well I say ,  the Bible says somewhere ,  by the fruit you will know the
that ,  if you look at the people and the fruit that they are producing is not good ,  then it means that something is wrong with that religion
yes ,  I like the Catholic church ,  I was raised as one and I think that there's a lot of hypocrites in it . 
I think so too
And oh
I'm not a Catholic anymore but that's true ,  I agree with you ,  I witnessed so  much hypocrites and my dad ,  I used to think he was a hypocrite too because he used to say ,  I will remain a Catholic until I die but
while we were attending church he would do other things and then . 
Oh ,  and they love money too
No ,  they love money ,  he liked to gamble
And the Bible clearly says that you can't love God and money at the same time
Exactly
And what I've seen in religion is a lot of love for money .   And little help for poor people
And also in the name of the church or God there are these ,  it's like ,  they support this war when God ,  it's not a God of war
No , 
and so since they say that he's supporting the ,  for example here ,  I really love this nation because it has given me many opportunities ,  I'm not bashing it or anything but
What I say is that using God to support the armies who are fighting in other countries then is like if all others were bad
And the truth is that in other countries there are these fanatics ,  true ,  because for example in Iraq ,  for example with these fanatics who don't care
And kill people ,  if they're soldiers that they're killing ,  or kids ,  it's ,  an atrocity ,  I think it's terrible
yes but ,  God doesn't deal with killing people or wars
Exactly
in any religion
In any religion
but when there's fanaticism ,  religion reaches another level
Nevertheless they use it to ,  to support the cause
For example Catholics use religion to get a lot of money
Exactly
For the pockets of the priests
yes that's why they're so rich
This is something I've never liked . 
Me neither ,  and those who are so rich and have ,  and have their museum of art work and all this there inside of
Of what do they called that ,  there in Rome is The chapel sixty nine
What ? 
That is has the Sistine chapel ,  that has a lot of artist's richness of within the decades ,  and that ,  that they guard those treasures for them And all that money ,  and their participation for example in the times of the
second world war that supported the Nazis a lot also
Is an old religion .  Very rigid ,  that doesn't change with the times either That's why I've never liked it
And how do you see the other religions ,  I mean that are not Christians how
Well ,  I don't like the Christian conservatives much either because they are very rigid people that judge everyone if one doesn't believe in Jesus Christ in a certain way
aha
You go to hell .  You are going to burn there .  And well I think that there are good people in all the religions ,  there are Jews ,  there are Muslims ,  there are
And ,  and no I think that is a God that loves people ,  is not a God that hates people .  yes ,  yes
I think that his day will come
Then for God there are no wars or any of that
I think that the only one that can clean this world of so many bad things that are happening is him I know he will do it in its due time
Because man has tried to solve the issues for decades and look how things now keep on getting worse .  In fact they are so bad that we are
We are polluting our planet so much that the temperatures are changing drastically and there are happening
That's why there are hurricanes
the Hurricanes now are more powerful and more consistent
Because the environment is polluted from the man .  The man has a lot of hate ,  the man always wants the war Always wants the money , 
True ,  the materialism
Those are not Godly things
Yes here the concept is ,  if you don't have money ,  you're called a loser because
Ah ,  this is horrible . 
It's a horrible modern concept that is so destructive ,  but they knew that God at least set on the people who had
material things but not spiritual treasures .   And religion today is really corrupt
yes ,  religion is more than anything created for man
And modified and everything ,  in ,  in its way .   For example many of these things that I've seen on television from other religions ,  for example evangelicals teach
ah ,  they also ask for a lot of money in fact and many things that they talk about don't even come from the Bible ,  and so I think that a
an evangelical minister well ,  wasn't something like ,  I forget his name ,  who was saying that they should kill the president of Venezuela ,  Chavez
Horrible Jesus
imagine that someone who ,  someone who takes the lead in their church and said that ,  what the United States needs to do once and for all is to kill
this president
Because if you study the commandments ,  one of the commandments is don't kill your neighbor . 
yes ,  exactly
So you believe in this ,  you can't believe in wars . 
This is why i keep saying by it's fruit they will recognize because ,  in the Bible it talks about ,  about a false Christ ,  a false prophet ,  that talks about coming from the part of God and in reality
He's a hypocrite or is being used by the devil to mislead people .   And many people are being misled these days by this because in reality
Instead of learning what's taught in the bible ,  well ,  learning what the men teach
hmm ,  true
And look at home many religions these days say that they're Christian ,  and have so many different things
You ,  do you go to a religion ?   Do you follow or a religion ?   or do you go to church ? 
Well ,  I ,  I was a Jehovah witness for a long time but not anymore because I had some problems in my marriage that really got to me
in a spiritual way ,  but that has been my faith since I was a teenager .  In the beginning I was a Catholic ,  I was raised as one and then I became a Protestant ,  I was looking
for something ,  so I found it and I think that I really found him
And didn't that religion ask you for money the whole time . 
No ,  not my religion ,  they wouldn't ask for money .

Good afternoon ,  my name is Milgram from Connecticut . 
Hello ,  Stefanie . 
How are you ,  I
From Miami . 
I spoke to you before ,  or not ? 
I think so . 
Mm
How are you ? 
Fine ,  thanks and you ? 
Fine
So listen ,  is that ,  is religion . 
yes , 
What religion are you ? 
Christian . 
Oh ,  Christian . 
And you ? 
I'm Catholic . 
Ah
So you are the one who has the husband who is also in the religion ,  right ? 
yes
Aha
yes
So but ,  we haven't both discussed this topic yet ,  right ? 
yes well we've discussed a lot because I think that you have ,  you have a granddaughter too
Aha ,  aha ,  Hmmm
who was born recently ,  and
yeah
so
well ,  let's keep talking here ,  let's see
Well
So
Eh ,  eh well ,  what do you think about religion ? 
Well ,  I find that it depends on the religion ,  sometimes it divides ,  and sometimes not .   I visit all the churches ,  and where they invite me I go , 
Hmmm
I don't offend anyone ,  their religion ,  but I don't like fanatics either ,  who ,  who know you and try to ,  to put all the religion through their eyes ,  I don't like it
Hmmm
Because I think that each person is free to think ,  and ,  and decides like an adult . 
Hmmm
But I've visited a lot of the evangelical church , 
Hmmm
And they've brought service to the house of what they call ,  like an oration ,  those oration circles that they do . 
Hmmm
that they have a time to go to the house praying for the person ,  and to see if they want to convert and enter into their religion . 
Hmmm
But I've participated a lot ,  because my aunt and my cousin's husband ,  they both belong to the evangelical church . 
Hmmm
So when they had activities ,  they always invited me and I participated with them .   But , 
That's good . 
the Muslim religion is so ,  I don't know ,  I find it a little bit
Fanatical
Yes ,  too much ,  too much .   Yes ,  I think that ,  that the Jews ,  well they are their religion and they don't mix with anyone . 
Well ,  and also ,  ah ? 
But ,  no ,  tell me
No ,  I was going to say that also ,  eh ,  the Jews are the base of the Christian religion . 
Hmmm
And that I ,  you know ,  many times it's not necess  I don't know what I was going to say ,  I forgot ,  but ,  no
But ,  like you think that ,  that the Jewish religion ,  because I ,  I don't find ,  like ,  I find that I ,  they respect their days ,  they are very ,  I think that very
like very organized ,  I would say .   You know
Hmmm
But to everyone ,  religion always divides ,  because not everyone has the same concept ,  I think . 
No
There's a concept that I believe isn't in everyone ,  aha ,  yes . 
Hello ? 
the truth it seems like another call is coming in ,  but they can wait . 
Oh okay , 
It must be my daughter calling me ,  but it's ok .   What a shame that she would call me right now .   Aha ,  So and
yes
Like ,  you know more about religion that I do ,  because you're in Christianity ,  so you must know a lot more than me about
about religion .   Because I feel that I'm in the Catholic church ,  but I'm not fanatic about being there every Sunday ,  or at all the masses . 
Well I think that ,  that religion divides and unifies at the same time .   If you have ,  you know ,  the same idea or you know ,  it's the same religion ,  of course it will unify ,  but
I know that if I get together ,  let's say ,  with a Muslim ,  and we start to talk about religion ,  we won't be unified ,  we will be divided . 
Because they're ,  you know ,  two completely different ways of thinking . 
But you ,  what religion are you ,  are you ,  because there's baptist ,  there's evangelical , 
I'm Christian .   I'm Christian .   I believe in the Bible ,  I believe in God ,  I believe in Jesus Christ ,  I go to a ,  a church
let's say ,  what you say ,  eva ,  evangelical .   I don't have any
Ah
eh ,  classification .   I'm only Christian . 
Oh okay ,  I thought that you were ,  because there's also this religion of the ,  like they call the others ,  the witnesses of
No ,  no ,  no
There are Jehovah's witnesses ,  there are evangelicals ,  baptists ,  I don't remember what the other one was .   But always each ,  each one has its ,  how do you say ,  its difference . 
Hm mm
Because I don't think that the belief is the same ,  right . 
No ,  eh I ,  I don't know .  I don't go to a church where you know ,  they have eh ,  every Sunday ,  eh
You guys wear makeup ,  and dance and all that ,  or not ? 
you know ,  we talk about the bible ,  no ,  no .  We also sing the ,  the songs well a touch yes ,  and you know ,  things like that ,  but is not anything
Hm mm
eh ,  we don't dance or any of that .  You know ,  but
But you put on makeup ,  or cut your hair
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
Oh ,  you can wear makeup ? 
yes ,  is not ,  is none of that . 
yes ,  because the ,  the Evangelical one is that they don't even cut their hair ,  and
Ah ,  well I don't know
yes I don't know ,  the the Evangelicals don't cut their hair and they are not supposed to wear makeup ,  nor use too much jewelry . 
No ,  none of that .  Eh ,  is a ,  you know ,  we are a group of people that believe in the bible ,  and we spend the time you know ,  unified ,  together . 
Hm mm
Sundays singing the songs and and ,  listening to the bible ,  learning what the bible says how it lives in our life .  That is
basically the ,  the
The concept ,  aha . 
how to say it ,  our religion . 
Oh ,  ok . 
But that's nothing .  that you can't cut your hair ,  that you can only wear a skirt ,  that you don't have to wear
Right ,  right ,  no ,  because i thought that ,  when you said christian
You know ,  none of that . 
I thought that you were the kind of christian that doesn't wear pants ,  or ,  or make up ,  or have ,  very long hair
No ,  none of that ,  none of that .  No ,  not even this ,  you know ,  yeah ,  yeah the bible says you shouldn't do it
But ,  uh ,  despite that ,  nothing ,  none of that ,  you know
Right
If i want to go to dance
Uh um . 
I can go to dance ,  i don't like it because i don't like to go to clubs ,  you know
Right ,  right . 
But in ,  you know ,  right ,  right
Look ,  they have ,  lets say ,  a family party ,  you can go to it ,  and it's not
Yes ,  yes . 
Right ,  oh ,  OK
Yeah ,  i ,  i
No ,  because
You know ,  the ones i said ,  if it doesn't say in the bible that it cannot be done ,  well ,  uh
Uh um
I don't do it ,  whatever ,  You know ,  those are my rules ,  but I don't have anything against cutting my hear or like that
Oh
So ,  you kno
I know ,  we agree ,  at the same time it gets closer ,  it also divides
yes
to the people ,  because not everybody is ,  look ,  my cousin's husband is evangelic
Mmm
Also is mu Aunt ,  and they are people ,  that despite their evangelic religion ,  my aunt does not cut her hair ,  neither does dye
her hair ,  my Aunt only wears their suits and skirts ,  well ,  when we trow a family party ,  they go ,  and if there are jokes ,  well they
don't get mad ,  I mean ,  there are other people that are religious and you joke with them and
they get mad ,  and start talking about the lord and how you're are going to get punished ,  by the demon ,  and all those things they say
Mmm
But ,  i find that that all things depends in the level of the people ,  the skill that they have to fell comfortable
yes
with religion ,  do you follow/
Mmm
So ,  I think that everything depends in that ,  the great amount of those people have sinned their whole
life ,  and at one moment they go to church and believe that they are God and they can correct everyone else
Mmm
Do you follow ?  ,  So ,  after all that everyone else is a sinner ,  but they don't see that they sinned first
Not me ,  we are not like that .  We believe that ,  you know ,  even when I go to church ,  and all that stuff ,  and that ,  I am still a sinner . 
I´m not I´m not perfect ,  nothing at all .  You know ,  so I don´t ,  I don´t spend the time ,  you know saying bad things , whatever
but I know that I will never be perfect like him ,  like the Lord .  So I always have to ,  try to live my life the best because I am human . 
Aha
And because I am human ,  I´m not perfect .  But at the same time ,  if I am with a person that believes ,  lets say ,  that she must not cut the
hair ,  or wear makeup ,  or only wears skirts ,  lets say I am invited to a party by them ,  or something ,  then I try to ,  to
to go
yes ,  in the conditions ,  exactly .  Hmmm
Aha .  You know ,  not to offend them
And to respect their ,  their aha ,  yes ,  yes ,  when I go to the ,  I go to the I have visited the church ,  my aunts church , 
and I well ,  when I go to their place ,  well yes I use a suit ,  my ,  my skirt under the knees ,  because they don´t use it other way . 
yes
Although now they are a little more ,  how do you say ,  different ,  and the young people is more modern ,  they are not with that thing so much
they say that people that use short skirts and wear makeup ,  and like jewelry ,  actually have not accepted the Lord . 
That is their theory .  Understand it
yes but I think that the same too if you want that ,  lets say ,  that someone come to the church and hear what the
what the Lord has to say , when people acts like that ,  in my opinion ,  no no it is ,  eh ,  is not easy for a person ,  that comes ,  lets say ,  that has never been at ,  at the church
to go to that church .  You know what I mean .  That there are many
Aha
rules and many things that they have to do ,  before coming to the church .  And I think one must go to the church ,  like you always are . 
Uh um ,  exactly ,  um
You don't have to be so ,  you know ,  you don't have to change the way you dress ,  or whatever ,  and maybe you start to ,  to go
and you start to believe what they say ,  then that's when the change comes ,  not before . 
Right ,  right . 
¿Do you understand or not ? 
Yes ,  because i remember some time when ,  i remember ,  yes ,  an invitation from a church ,  so one of the ladies told me ,  no ,  but you
you can't dress like that ,  because that is an offense to the lord ,  you coming with clothes ,  and ,  well ,  i always wear pants ,  and bracelets ,  and i wear a watch . 
No ,  but
Because if i can't go like that ,  well i won't go ,  because i believe in god ,  and i have my faith ,  but no ,  I'm also not a fanatic . 
Uh um .  Well ,  and that's what i mean ,  because i also think ,  my opinion is that a lot of people ,  like they don't exactly understand what the bible says ,  because
if you read what ,  who Jesus was with ,  you know ,  not the perfect people ,  the good ,  or what
ever ,  he was with the people what was ,  lets say ,  the worse .  And the people who needed help most .  People that ,  you know
That was disoriented ,  and in
Yes .  So ,  i think that when people these days goes ,  saying all that ,  no make up ,  no clothes and stuff like that ,  they forget
where it was ,  you know ,  where everything started . 
Well ,  i think that it also depends on ,  on the interpretation you give to the bible ,  because they say that it's written in the bible
That you have to let go of the material things ,  the clothes ,  the dressing and being
Good afternoon . 
Good afternoon ,  my name is Gloria . 
I am Norma ,  from Atlanta ,  Georgia ,  where are you from ? 
Oh ,  how are you ? 
Again we find ourselves , 
We are ,  we are the only ones who speak at this time
yes ,  I guess , 
On that we had to talk because I did not understand that this man said . 
Good ,  I have to talk about religion . 
Okay . 
Yes ,  unify religions ,  that religions unified ,  that is your opinion of homosexuality . 
From homosexual ? 
Or the
a man with a man ,  is that what you're saying ? 
yes . 
Oh ,  okay . 
Homosexuality ,  and then ,  what else .  yes ,  all
I did not understand .  I did not understand ,  nothing I said ,  nothing . 
yes ,  all out ,  or if they were all if more are unified ,  if all were of the same religion . 
Oh ,  okay .  No ,  I think there must be many different religions .  My would be good eh everyone is out of the same religion ,  but hey
yes ,  that would be ideal , 
it will be impossible .  Is impossible ,  is ridiculous . 
Aha . 
Because everybody you know ,  one is raised differently . 
Aha . 
You know .  Ay ,  I , 
Of course ,  hm mm
Do they call you every day ? 
yes ,  most of the time ,  when I'm home ,  here always ,  they call ,  and I answer . 
yes ?  Ah ,  I ,  today was the only one I got .  Yesterday they called me and I didn't get it .  And the day before yesterday because ,  from here that I run to the room , 
the man got disconnected .  Anyway , 
Ah . 
So ,  anyway ,  I'm Catholic .  Then ,  I now ,  ah ,  eh like in fifteen minutes I'm taking my kid to a youth ministry
so that he ,  is ,  he doesn't want to go ,  but I'm going to make him go so he gets together with kids from the same religion ,  so that
like that they share and
Of course ,  to develop his ,  his spiritual inclination . 
and he learns ,  yes ,  exactly .  But he doesn't understand that .  He thinks that
He doesn't ,  he doesn't want ,  doesn't want anything to do with religion . 
You know .  Exactly . 
that ,  he's a teenager ,  sure . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes
Yes ,  I figure
So ,  I want him to be ,  to have even a little bit of ,  you know ,  because I
Yes ,  it's always nice ,  right ? 
he ,  has always gone to church and now he does not ,  and he fight about it ,  we are always fighting to go to church
I go alone ,  because if we are going to fight then is worthless
Of course
to take him
I mean ,  always ask him ,  they would listen ,  but know ,  they are in a insurgence time
Yes
So ,  that's a bit difficult ,  but ,  they always listen ,  and always talk to him ,  not about church ,  but about the relation with God ,  and that's really important
Yes ,  yes
That way he would always have a spiritual base ,  right ? 
yes ,  exactly
Of course ,  because in the moment they would need to go trough a suffer ,  a catastrophe ,  you always come back to the supreme being
Yes
No matter what relgion ,  any religion
Yes
You always go back and look for the only one that can help
Exactly ,  that exactly ,  I say that you should not get to that point ,  You should pray everyday
Yeah
You know ,  uhm ,  giving him the time you need for him on Sunday ,  we go to church on Sundays
Hm mm
giving him an hour ,  no ,  he always has to be running ,  you want from church ,  and he doesn´t want to go ,  and we have arguments ,  and everyone tells me ,  allow him not to go ,  and I say
yes ,  he has to go ,  forget about it .  I can talk to everyone and they tell me ,  no ,  you´re doing it wrong because
you go with him ,  and you´re both fighting ,  what good are you getting from going to church
yes ,  I mean ,  just suggest it .  I mean ,  don´t force him a lot ,  because if you force him he´ll get more rebellious
yes ,  yes ,  that´s whats happening .  He´s getting
yes ,  always in a nice way ,  suggest if he wants to go ,  and I don´t know ,  that you´re going to see something that ,  I mean ,  activities that he wants to do
Yeah ,  yes ,  yes
no ,  he has friends who go and well
yes ,  yes ,  as he is now ,  he likes to be alone ,  and I tell him no ,  you should have little friends ,  this is the age when you have a few friends
you know ,  who come to your house ,  you go to their house ,  and you know ,  they ,  they ,  they hang out together .  But then he says ,  but you don´t want me to hang out
it´s true ,  they go to the mall and I don´t like them going to the mall
Yeah
You know ,  a lot of this boys ,  their mothers let them go to the mall alone ,  but I won´t let him go
Yeah
But I tell him ,  if you find a boy of the same religion ,  then you can go bowling ,  or skating ,  but we´ll see where ,  where
where we end up tonight
yes ,  that´s right .  It´s a little difficult dealing with children ,  no ?  when they grow up ,  they want to go their own way ,  their
yes . 
own ideas ,  no ,  but ,  well ,  there are the parents ,  to
yes .  yes . 
to guide them ,  right . 
Hm mm .  My oldest was the same . 
Oh yeah ? 
I would argue with him to go to church ,  and now he doesn't go to church .  And he's already big .  I say but you do call me to pray for you when you left for Iraq . 
yes he calls me when he has a problem ,  yes pray ,  that's why ,  you always have to be in good standing with God
Hm mm
so like that you don't have to call anyone to , 
Hm mm . 
to pray for you .  If you are praying yourself . 
Of course ,  hm ,  mm . 
You know . 
yes ,  this is the time ,  right ,  very important that you have to form them ,  right ,  give some guidance ,  above all . 
Ah Aha ,  aha . 
No ,  and so that they can grown up later ,  right ,  with good habits ,  and
Aha ,  aha
and that you can form their ,  beliefs in the ,  the supreme Lord . 
Aha ,  aha .  So then ,  I buy it ? 
Because if you don't have
Hm mm
If you don't have a God ,  your life is empty ,  Hm mm
Exactly ,  that's so right ,  so right .  That's what I told him ,  but he said ,  do you know what he said the other day ?  He said ,  where was God when I went through this
and I told him that that was supposed to happen so he'd learn ,  oh ,  when ,  let me tell you ,  the dog ,  a dog was ran over
Where was God when ,  od od and I ,  the dog lived but he told me ,  oh yes ,  there's a God ,  because we prayed for that dog ,  that was
ran over by a car ,  and ,  and
Aha . 
she's still alive ,  so ,  he said ,  ah yes ,  yes ,  there's a God ,  you are right . 
Sure ,  they do understand ,  no ,  understand
Hm mm . 
they really pay attention ,  you might think they don't listen but children always listen
Aha ,  yes ,  yes
Right ?  And they learn ,  so if you go on being religious ,  if you attend church an have devotion ,  he'll follow
Aha ,  aha
your good example .  Sure ,  because ,  I mean ,  not everything ,  anyway ,  children learn from their parents ,  no ,  the parents are the first teachers
yes ,  yes ,  true ,  true ,  that's what I always tell him . 
Hm mm
So ,  he ,  he ,  he sometimes ,  when we go to church ,  he fall asleep ,  it's so embarrassing ,  oh my God . 
Hm mm
And came ah  Even sleeping a lot ,  he falls asleep . 
Hm mm
The music puts him to sleep .  I don't know what gets him sleepy .  The singing that gets him sleepy .  And it's an embarrassment because we can't sit in the front ,  we can sit in the back and he
there snores Then he tells me he's bored ,  that ,  that what they say he doesn't  doesn't want to hear it ,  that Oh my God . 
But don't they have youth programs in your religion ? 
No . 
There ,  in  the church ? 
No ,  I think they have ,  but when you go to mass ,  the ,  the mass ,  the father preaches about what he wants . 
Ah ,  yes ,  yes ,  aha . 
and is for everyone .  You know ,  is not a mass for me ,  I'm sure there's a m  a mass for kids , 
Hm mm
but it's at nine in the morning .  He's not going to want to go to church so early .  He likes to sleep .  So we go at twelve . 
So at twelve the  the mass is for the  the adults ,  more or less . 
Hm mm
No ,  not so much for the  the kids . 
Hm mm
So then he ,  finds it boring . 
yes ,  well it would be good for you to enroll him there in a program ,  right ,  find out if there's a youth program so that there he hm
Kind ,  that's why I want to take him tonight because is for the young people . 
Of course ,  aha . 
So ,  he don't want to go
for him to feel more interested ,  find friends ,  because if you really want to be in a gropu ,  you must have friends ,  don't you ? 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
In a group you need to find friends ,  who share your ideas ,  your interests ,  this is how you cheer up
Exactly ,  yes .  That's why I want him to go tonight ,  because it's a group of young people
Hm mm
who ,  who I guess they help elder people ,  you know ,  look for food for poor people , 
Sure .  Oh that's nice ,  that's nice
yes
Hm mm
But then he goes like ,  oh ,  but I'll have to work with the elder ,  I don't like working with the elder , 
Oh forget it ,  it's impos  He just wants to watch TV and play computer games ,  I
Oh
I am fed up with that ,  I'll switch it off .  Where you free today ? 
Ah ? 
Today is Jewish holiday .  You don't work ,  do you ? 
No ,  I don't work
Oh ,  how good . 
yes ,  I work with my sons ,  here at home .  They make me mad sometimes
Oh ,  yes ,  I can imagine ,  yes I hear them .  How old are them ? 
Ah ,  here is the little one that's three years old .  Well a friend has come to visit with her little girl as well ,  so they are playing
Ah ,  oh ,  O . K .  Anyways ,  eh ,  how many minutes do we have ? 
Aha . 
My throat is sore now ,  you talk . 
No ,  well ,  you say that about homosexuality and religions ,  me
Oh .  You know ,  I got a nephew that is homosexual and
Ah , 
and I feel bad because we know that God does not accept that . 
And we tell him ,  you know , 
Ah , 
God made you that way ,  and they say that G  that they don't get born that way ,  he was born that way ,  one that has to 
Of course that there are kids that are born that way .  Yes . 
Yes .  One has to have one ,  one in the family ,  so you can tell ,  you know ,  how he was raised and all that . 
Of course ,  Yes . 
We knew since he was very little .  And now he is confused and now he doesn't want to go to church cause of what they say ,  but I found a church that accepts them . 
Hmmm
And talks about them and all
Yes , 
But he hasn't come out of the closet yet .  He's not out of the how do you say ,  closet . 
yes . 
But we all know ,  you know . 
Sure . 
But he ,  he's always frustrated ,  boor thing ,  bless him .   He's thirty seven . 
Ah ,  yes .   Yes ,  it's a real hardship ,  because there are people like
yes . 
who say they're born this way ,  no .   Who have this
Aha . 
this ,  this inclination from when they're born ,  with the hormones ,  or the internal organs in their bodies but ,  like
yes . 
really ,  it's ,  well us in the church we believe in the law of karma ,  the reaction that you're paying for activities lived out in the previous life . 
Aha . 
So ,  for this ,  but ,  really ,  you have your relationship with God ,  and you should cultivate it ,  yes ,  like ,  it doesn't matter in what way .   No ? 
Aha . 
Even when ,  you're a homosexual ,  or poor ,  or right ,  or ugly ,  or pretty ,  this doesn't , 
Hmm . 
because the important things is ,  isn't the covering of your body ,  the
yeah
what's important is the spiritual soul that you have ,  not the
yes ,  yes ,  exactly . 
What's important is the soul ,  that ,  and the relation that you can develop with God , 
Hmm .   Hmm
No ,  and their devotion ,  that's ,  that's very important ,  ¿right ? 
Uh um . 
Right ,  and now ,  this body is an external cover ,  that you re act according to the external cover because you are conditioned
Right ,  right . 
But ,  you have to ,  i don't know ,  transcend the material platform ,  ¿right ?  ,  and look ,  a more transcendental platform in your relationship with god . 
Uh um . 
Right ,  many times it's not easy ,  but there's always a process you can control ,  right ,  you can control rules and regulations . 
Yes
Right ,  for you to keep a religious life
That's what i say
It really is a shame ,  right . 
That's what i tell him .  I tell him ,  "open your bible" ,  then ,  he says "Uh ,  but nobody wants me in church" ,  these and that .  .  . 
Um
I say ,  "open your bible ,  and ,  and ,  and try to have a relationship with god by yourself"
Right ,  i mean ,  the relationship is personal . 
So that he can speak to you and you hear him ,  you know ,  they say you can hear ,  you hear him and he tells you where you have to ,  what path you must choose . 
Uh um . 
Or if you're going to stay like hat ,  to give you peace of mind . 
Uh um . 
Because i ,  i ,  i imagine that he is frustrated every day . 
Hm mm
Every day ,  poor boy does not know to ask . 
Clearly ,  yes ,  really is a shame people like that ,  no ,  but and
Aha . 
Good
Hello
Hello
My ,  my name is Gloria .  How are you ? 
Good my name is Jennie
Hi
Hi
I gave you
Where are you ? 
I live in New York
Oh ,  I'm in Nebraska
Oh Nebraska ,  my mother is there . 
yeah
So ,  we have to talk about religion . 
yes
okay
And do you find it difficult sometimes to understand what the machine is saying ? 
I didn't understand anything that he said ,  but I talked to another lady before this ,  And it was about religion and ,  how do you think religion
is accepting homosexuals ?  If you're against it ?  something like that about religion . 
aha because I was listening but I really didn't understand anything he was saying ,  aha . 
Really ,  we should call that man and tell him ,  that they should put someone who speaks Spanish . 
yes
Not ,  not an American trying to translate . 
yes because that one sounds really bad . 
I know So Are you Catholic or what religion are you ? 
Yes I'm Catholic ,  aha
Catholic ,  oh ,  me too . 
yes
yes so then ,  I don't think that homosexuals I have one in the family and I believe they are born like that
ah , 
as much as one tries ,  You know everybody believes that they are not born like that .  But a lot of them are born like that . 
I think so too . 
yes ,  yes
aha ,  I think that ,  well one can't just .  like if something bad happens in their life ,  like a man with a woman . 
right aha
That after that they start being the other way . 
aha
That's one thing ,  that I think is born inside of you . 
aha
But I really don't understand ,  so .  How can I understand ?  if I'm not like that . 
Exactly ,  and you know what I don't understand ,  who like me ,  my nephew is homosexual .  But he likes to call on men who are married . 
That I do not understand . 
I also knew a boy , 
mhm
he was a homosexual
aha
And he also had many married men , 
yes
And I really do not understand . 
That I do not understand ,  because . 
No
I don't know
aha ,  it is an ugly thing
But it happens a bunch because the other day Oprah had a program with many cute boys . 
aha
This ,  with a homosexual . 
aha . 
Who are married and all .  And fuck ,  you know the fags as they say ,  aha . 
aha . 
wow ,  it's horrible ,  it's horrible ,  but you know . 
yes until
what I think is ,  that it should ,  like I say to him ,  he's so confused ,  I say ,  pray to God and he will give you the road that he wants you to take . 
aha
although you want to be this ,  he'll help you .   If it's like this that you have to live ,  he will find your peace and your tranquility . 
aha
But he ,  he hasn't come out of the closet ,  let's say .   We know it but him ,  you know . 
aha
Since my dad doesn't know ,  his grandfather doesn't know . 
aha
But he ,  he's already like thirty six . 
Aha
So ,  you know ,  but at times he sees girls and he likes girls too so ,  I don't understand . 
Me neither ,  this makes me sick .   This boy that I knew once said to me . 
I get it .   I know ,  I know
That he preferred to be with a guy because he didn't like how ,  to feel something soft ,  he wanted to feel something hard . 
oh my God
He said this to me and then he also said that he had a girlfriend . 
yes ,  aha
But he only had a girlfriend because ,  what he really wanted wasn't normal . 
ah
And you see that ,  that all the people makes pressure on me , 
aha
so she dates a girl knowing that ,  well he was homosexual
ah wow
aha ,  but because what he says ,  if he knew he made everything ,  all his life . 
yes
only that he didn't let me know ,  she was ashamed . 
aha
But when he was older ,  that's when it came out that well the girls
yes ,  yes we noticed that when my nephew was about ,  about two years old
Oh ,  yes
We knew ,  we knew ,  something was different . 
aha
You know ,  from other ,  from the other kids . 
aha ,  aha
That a pain ,  but the mother accepted him and loves him ,  and he is very close to his mother . 
aha ,  mhm
And you know ,  he is a good guy ,  what it hurts is that he is so good . 
aha aha yes
and ,  and he appeared to complete ,  you know ,  yes ,  are you Latin or american ? 
I'm not we  I have a Mexican mother and French father
ah
So well I am both
ah ,  which parent is which ? 
My mom is Latina . 
aha
And my dad is French . 
What does that mean ? 
Well my father is is white ,  he's from here .  And my mo 
American
aha and my mom , 
From Nebraska . 
yes ,  and my mom is a Mexican from Mexico . 
Oh ,  okay ,  okay
so it is ,  mhm
what a mix ,  what a mix ,  because you don't sound ,  you don't sound Spanish I mean you speak Spanish but you sounds like you're American . 
yes I was born ,  born here . 
Oh ,  you were born there ,  oh ,  okay . 
aha ,  so it is ,  and while there's a lot of people ,  there aren't many people here who speak Spanish . 
oh ,  I can imagine ,  I've never talked to someone who lives there ,  it's cold there right . 
yes ,  yes ,  it's very cold today . 
yes ,  yes ,  here
it's around forty degrees and they said that it can go as low as twenty nine tonight . 
Oh my God
yes .  I don't know ,  you tell me .  Do you think that homosexuals are Christians ? 
Are Christians
yes
I know that ,  my nephew ,  he is confused . 
aha
he tries ,  because we are Catholics ,  super Catholics . 
mhm
And ,  we take him to church and he reads the Bible .  You know ,  he's close to God but I think that the devil is temping him . 
And sometimes ,  he chats with other men in the Internet ,  cla ,  cla ,  cla ,  cla . 
aha
And ,  I tell him ,  keep reading your Bible .  That ,  eventually ,  you are not going to be wanting to be in the Internet . 
aha
But when he leaves the Bible ,  he says ,  he says he feels lonely .  He thinks that the Bible ,  God is not answering his questions ,  that sometimes he is waiting for an answer from God . 
aha
That ,  he wants Him to come to his door ,  or help him feel better ,  release the tension that you have in your mind .  But ,  he becomes desperate ,  he doesn't want to wait . 
mhm
you ,  God does things when he wants . 
aha aha
It's not when you want .  So ,  it seems as if he can't wait . 
But what the ,  well what has me confused ,  is that in the bible it says that a relationship is between a woman , 
aha And a man ,  I know ,  I know ,  I know . 
and a man .  And that ,  ah ,  that says the complete opposite of what the bible says . 
I know ,  I know ,  I know .  But you know that ,  I start arguing with my sister ,  my sister tells me ,  look ,  the bible ,  men wrote it ,  God has to accept him because God made him like that . 
Well ,  yes is true . 
You ,  you know ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and he is ,  and he is .  And ,  and is not and is if it was a person ,  if God loves ,  who was it that she always refers to ,  Magdalene ,  who ,  who was
a whore and all that , 
aha
that ,  that he ,  he forgave her for all her sins .  if he forgave her ,  he forgives my son . 
aha
That what she tells me .  Is true that what the bible says but you know ,  God forbid that when he has to see him , 
he forgets the sins . 
aha
You know ,  I don't know because I don't know many people like that ,  is a shame . 
aha
Is a shame ,  because one never knows . 
aha
You never know when their storm is a big one .  Being different of the common .  And you know ,  you have to hide ,  you never now ,  and sometimes they get all over
Yes ,  yes
You know ,  he has been lucky that until this moment ,  they never get him
yes
But ,  my nephew told me that their neighbors in California were trapped ,  and they broke their mouth ,  Oh ,  my God
Oh ,  that's bad
And people that doesn't like that kind of people are really bad ,  what I say ,  those Redneck Americans ,  those sons of a bitch
yes
Yes ,  they don't also like Latins either
Yes ,  they don't like anyone ,  none
yes
no other people ,  different for saying somethin
yes
No ,  that's true ,  And well ,  here in this place there are many people like that
Yes ,  i can imagine
It deppends on where you are ,  Here in this state ,  there are many small towns
yes
It's mainly Americans
yes
And well ,  they are not used to have other races here
aha ,  and I imagine ,  I did not know that there are Mexicans in Nebraska . 
yes ,  in Omaha there are plenty ,  if there is a part of Omaha that , 
oh ,  yes ,  oh
that is pure hispanic ,  untill they can't find not one American shop ,  or anything
Ah ,  wow
And for the other place ,  eh ,  it's a city but it isn't too big ,  but it also has plenty of Mexicans too . 
Aha ah
But here were we used to live ,  my husband and I
Aha
But put it like that ,  I do not look like a mexican ,  if you know what I mean
Aha ,  and you are a dark Mexican or white mexican
White
Because there are whites that do not have color

<colorcito does not exist as a word so I have no ideea what he means about that>
I'm white but because I have brown eyes and hair too
aha aha
But my husband is well brown and so they say the's the unique Mexican around here . 
Ah
But he loves it so
Aha
People really treat him very ,  very good . 
Oh ,  okay
He is one of those people that can get along with everyone ,  and If he doesn't like someone
With everyone ,  yes
Hello . 
Hello . 
Hi ,  from Texas
I'm Manuel from Chicago
Okay ,  we are getting connected everyday now
I think ,  I think there isn't no one more in the study ,  right ? 
It seems like ,  do you have to wait a lot ? 
No ,  The phone ringed
Oh ,  really ?  ,  because they called me and I waited a little bit ,  they couldn't connect me with someone else ,  so I called .  And always a call they connect me with you
Mmm ,  weird
I think there is no one else
Yes ,  everybody left ,  I talked to a lady ,  she told me that she already had like 15 calls
yes
yes
From where ? 
That ,  she completed 15 calls of the study
No ,  i mean ,  where was she from ? 
Oh ,  New York ,  yes
Oh ,  I talked to her like two days ago
yes
ah I spoke to Yenny from Nebraska
aha
Eh , 
ah ,  you got to talk to her , 
When When I talked about ,  Well .  and she calls me Manuel . 
how funny . 
Ah ,  yes .  I told you she's my sister in law
Yes ,  yes ,  I remember yes
Ah , 
ah ,  I ,  yes ,  I ,  I I've told a couple of friends to get into the study but I haven't gotten to talk to them ,  yes
No .  Oh ,  they are already in the study Ah ,  yes they're already in it . 
Yes ,  yes ,  they are also doing the study but eh ,  when I wrote to ,  I wrote to the ,  to the guy guy a while back oh ,  I don't ,  don't
know ,  if it's a man or woman ,  but ah ,  he told me he had sixty at that moment .  When I ,  ah ,  was starting the study ,  he told me that he ,  eh . 
When they had two hundred people that were in the study Was that it was better .  In other words you have to wait less time ,  to be connected . 
with someone because at the beginning I had problems that I ,  would wait and wait suddenly it would seem like they were going to connect me with someone and then the call would get disconnected ,  they would disconnect me . 
Oh , 
So then .  It hasn't happened again . 
Well ,  no I've just talked to you With Yenni and with another person from Colorado . 
Ah ,  yes
Only the  first call I did was from Colorado .  A gentleman from Colorado .  yes ,  then later it was with you .  Then with Yenni ,  another time with you ,  another time with you . 
No ,  i spoke to a Puerto Rican woman ,  uh ,  that was calling from Miami ,  and i spoke to that lady that is also half Puerto Rican and she was from New York
And i spoke to that old Puerto Rican lady . 
yeah
And i spoke to Jenni ,  and i spote to you .  And i spole to a man from Panama ,  that i don't remember where he was from either .  But yeah ,  I've spoken to a lot of people
Oh ,  that's good ,  uh ,  ¿and what do you want to tell me about religion now ? 
Oh ,  oh ,  let's see what we talked about yesterday ,  we talked about religion a little bit
yes ,  a little bit
I don't even remember what .  But uh ,  i don't know ,  what can i tell you about religion .  .  .  I can tell you about my mom ,  for example ,  my mom is
she's ,  i don't know if you know a religion there that they are ,  they are protestants and they also call themselves Pentecostals
Yes
And in Puerto Rico ,  the Pentecostals are very conservative ,  they're very strict ,  and they don't let women cut their hair ,  they're not allowed to wear pants . 
They can't ,  uh ,  uh ,  put on make up .  And they can't wear accessories ,  uh ,  like bracelets ,  or earrings ,  or anything like that . 
OK
Very ,  very strict .  Uh ,  they can't cut their hair .  They must have long hair ,  and my mom went into that church
And i was like ,  oh ,  my sister was in high school ,  and then my mom wanted us to go with her to that church ,  and no way were we going with her there
To that church ,  because it was too restrictive and we were very little .  To ,  i mean ,  and we were teenagers ,  no way we were going to stop wearing pants
Or stop cutting our hair
Uh ,  right
Yeah ,  and then uh ,  the church was very weird ,  they uh ,  they would go in and start moving everywhere and
and speaking in ,  or they said things ,  and they said that they were speaking tongues ,  and that these trances they got into ,  that
that was part of of the Holly Spirit that God That was inside them and they did those things And my mom was on that church
Oh ,  like seven or eight years . 
Oh ,  yes
And afterwards finally she realised that no ,  that there were many things that were wrong but it's yes ,  very strange ,  and its a ,  I mean it's
eh ,  it's a Christian and Protestant church .  That is not ,  it's not a sect .  Or a strange one ,  it's just that they the have those very strict rules . 
Ah ,  what is your religion ? 
I don't have a religion .  Not now
You don't have a preference for any one . 
No ,  but ah ,  when I was growing up ,  since my mom got into that religion that was so strict and she wanted us to go with her
Ah , 
we then decided to go to the Baptist church it wasn't ,  they didn't have those rules like that .  But when my mom got into that religion ,  she also got to believe that Catholics don't
eh ,  Catholics were wrong ,  and like the Catholic church ,  ah ,  ah ah ,  you know they have ah ,  they give much importance to the Virgin Mary
and the ,  they other ,  they churches
Yea , 
protestant don't ,  don't don't ,  pray to the Virgin Mary ,  nor believe in the Virgin Mary
Ah ,  well ,  in in fact in the Catholic ,  they have saints even for rocks . 
Ah ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes , 
I mean I I since I was a kid ,  when I was a kid they instilled that religion on me ,  y don't reneague of that ,  I like it . 
mhm
But I won't reach the point in which they pray to the saint here ,  they pray to that saint over there and
yes
ah ,  each one ,  no ? 
hmm
There are people who are offended because I spoke badly about a saint or something ,  whatever thing
hmm
I ,  I don't get offended ,  it doesn't bother me that they talk ,  everyone can talk and say what they want ,  and it doesn't offend me ,  I'm saying
other people are offended ,  or the religion
yes ,  yes
ah , 
but I think that ,  either the person is bothered
it's something
I think that ,  I mean ,  I think that religions are good ,  eh and ,  I think that ,  I don't know ,  it's important when one is growing up ,  the people
for ,  for teenagers and for kids it's good for them to go to church to learn about other ,  other people from the same state . 
I always say there are bad people in the church but there's ,  uh ,  a great many kids and young people in the churches .   Who have good ideas , 
no ,  and who have
this yes ,  because
good plans , 
and now lately it's not the church anymore ,  not like before when you go to pray ,  go to mass and this and that . 
And now they give classes for young people ,  to keep them busy and not walk the streets . 
hmm
And that ,  that ,  I did see a lot of it ,  not just in one religion ,  in all of them . 
mh
They try to keep them busy ,  from an early age ,  kids ,  teaching them ,  ah ,  I've seen that they attend lots of courses ,  they take them
camping and lots of things like that . 
yes ,  yes ,  they go camping ,  yes
and that's good . 
yes ,  no ,  I think it's good ,  and ,  I ,  I mean ,  it's like ,  a social structure ,  they are a community and I think that ,  that ,  that
eh ,  when you move somewhere else ,  for example ,  it's okay because you get to meet new friends . 
mhm
If you go to a church ,  well ,  it becomes easier
Oh ,  yes
to meet people and if you are Hispanic ,  for example ,  it's easier if you go to a church that has a ,  program
in Spanish ,  for example ,  then you get to meet lots of people that speak Spanish and you can easily make new friends ,  I believe that ,  in that sense ,  religion is good ,  right ? 
I see , 
in a way ,  in a social way .  The problem is when people ,  like yesterday ,  they start thinking that their religion is the only one
and that everybody else are mistaken ,  and they loose
eh ,  I see ,  that's so wrong . 
but ,  I ,  I went to the Baptist church for many years ,  that was when I was in the University ,  when I had just started the University in Pue
and ,  and ,  it was something good for me ,  I got to meet lots of young people that liked to take part in activities ,  good activities
they wouldn't do bad things ,  I also had contact with ,  when you are in school ,  you meet people that do wrong stuff . 
Hey ,  ya
Then in that case ,  when he started university he started to think differently and the ideas were not going accordingly to the church
SO then I stopped going to church .  But
Many could
mm
No ,  I said that is good . 
mhm
You know you start going because your parents make  you go ,   or the family takes you to church . 
uhm
It is good that once you are older you can do the things you like and the thing you didn´t like
Now nobody is telling you what to do .  If you are older and you still go to church you know what you are doing . 
You take initiative and nobody else does it for you
It always needs to be like that .  Well ,  I do not have children and when I have them I don´t know how would I be ? 
But I think I would try not to force my children to do things they don´t want to . 
Oh ,  are you married ? 
No ,  I am not married . 
Oh , 
No  ,  but I think for some families this works fine . 
Some Religions are worse than others . 
mm
I think that in some ,  some of the things that they teach you basically block you from thinking in a way .   And
ah ,  yeah
And they don't ,  don't provide information so that you make critical ,  decisions ,  you have a critical mind and you make the decision that you think is correct . 
Ah ,  I went to school ,  to school until ninth grade .   It was a Catholic school .   And I learned everything about Catholic religion . 
Good evening .  I'm Joe . 
yes .  And I'm Carmen from Chicago . 
The Chicago .  How are you Carmen ? 
Good .  and you ? 
Good .  You ,  I think I talked to you a while back . 
yes ,  a while back .  You are the father of the girl ,  right ? 
yes .  yes ,  what a memory Wow
Uh Uh . 
How is everything going over there ,  good ? 
Good ,  thanks a little cold here . 
yes yes here too it's getting cold also .  We are having tomorrow already there's another cold front coming and we are going to have temperatures ,  it's going to snow . 
Oh ,  here it's going to go down God willing to sixty . 
so Ah ,  how much ? 
to sixty . 
yes ,  There ,  and is the wind strong over there and all that ? 
yes ,  yes
yes . 
And soon the snow is coming . 
Over there it always blows hard ,  right ? 
Uh ? 
The wind is more strong there than in other places . 
yes . 
yes .  I don't like that . 
Do you know today's subject ? 
yes ,  it's religion ,  it's good ,  how does religion affect people's lives .  Eh ,  and the influence it has on them ,  like the Jews . 
the inscriptions ,  they can work together . 
Uh uh . 
all those things ,  what do you think about that ? 
Well ,  in my opinion religion is good but not so good and not so bad for society .  There shouldn't um
be one religion only ,  imagine ,  one religion ,  I'm Catholic
Uh uh . 
but some people in my family are Christians .  One of my uncle he's kind of sick because he's so ,  so religious . 
Ah ,  he is too involved in it
Uh uh . 
and so ,  when he meets someone he immediately wants to force them to
convert . 
to make them join the church ,  he tells them that God is going to forgive them ,  when I go to Puerto Rico ,  that's the first thing he says to me
yes . 
Um .  That I should join his Church and I tell him ,  uncle I'm a Catholic ,  I don't have to go to church to believe in God ,  you don't have to be attend church
seven days a week
Uh huh . 
He's there seven days a week .   And I have an aunt who's Catholic but thanks to God and the virgin ,  she doesn't talk a lot about religion . 
Oh . 
But .   But I have a lot of family from different religions .   i have a lot of family who are Jehovah's witnesses . 
yeah . 
who go and visit houses from eight in the morning until ten ,  eleven at night .   And this bothers me because it means that
you come home tired from work to cook or tend to your family or to rest and they knock on your door to read you the word of God . 
You think it's bad that they go to read the word of God ? 
yes ,  you're Catholic ,  you tell them ,  I'm Catholic so they won't come back to bother you ever again . 
Uh huh . 
But I still tell them when they come to my house and the knock on my door that I open the door and I say ,  I'm Catholic and they tell me that ,  that
there's only one bible ,  there's only one God ,  and I tell them ,  I know .   I don't need to go to church every day to believe in God because
my dad taught me since when I was little ,  I remember my dad always had us kneel by the bed ,  everyone all around the bed ,  kneeling to pray
and my dad always told us ,  you don't need to go Sundays ,  Sunday in the morning ,  or Sunday at noon ,  or Sunday at night . 
in the afternoon to church .   Because you believe in God and you know that God exists ,  God is by your side twenty four hours a day . 
But ,  there are some people who don't ,  who need to be stuck in church .   Ah ,  to the power . 
And how do you see this ,  for example ,  with the world situation and the religious influences in the government and political decisions ? 
For for this reason there is a lot ,  there is
I ,  well
of war in the middle east that is happening because of religion . 
But i think that not only because of religion ,  the muslims ,  but at every age ,  for example ,  since the first world war ,  religion had ,  and i am talking about
Even the catholic religion had a lot of influence in the war and all those things ,  because the ,  for example ,  the pope Paulo the Sixth supported the Nazis a lot
Uh huh
in their extermination ,  i mean ,  not that he supported the extermination of the Jewish but he knew that when he handed the Jewish there in Italy ,  well he was helping to get them killed
Um
And that's how many died .  But that's how ,  i ,  my point is that ,  for example ,  religions these day have gotten too much into the politicians decisions
Uh um
That ,  they have used it as a justified guide to do things .  For example ,  this Iraq war
Uh huh
For example ,  it is said ,  oh ,  if the Christian religion ,  whell mom ,  i am talking on the phone .  That if the Christian religion well ,  it's like even god is with us
In every way ,  to fight them ,  so there ,  of course the Muslims think that God ,  Allah ,  is with them ,  is protecting them . 
Uh um . 
And like that ,  uh ,  there is a lot ,  and the Jewish too ,  in they way of worshipping they also think that . 
Uh huh . 
But ,  i always think about a thing the bible says ,  that you will know people by their fruit ,  the ones in god's side
How they practice .  Religion is really ,  the belief of the true worship ,  because if they don't practice it ,  like God and his son taught us ,  well
Uh um
Then there's something that says things aren't alright here
Uh huh .  Look ,  there priests that abuse the children ,  that were sent to another church to
Yes
even if they didn´t have the victims they hurt close to them
yes
But what´s the sense of changing them to another church if in the other church they´ll find more children
Exactly
And that´s not right
I mean ,  here in Colorado ,  uhm ,  a priest actually died
Hmm
But many of this man´s victims have come forward and they´re suing the Church because
Uh uh
because he got his way for many years .  And now ,  after he died ,  it seems like someone decided to take the initiative and expose
the things he had done because
Oh
everyone thought he was a saint
Uh uh
And he wasn´t .  He was a man who abused children and took advantage of them .  He took advantage of the children participating in church ,  and abused them
Hmm
That´s very hypocritical and I don´t think God will feel a lot of sympathy for people like that
Uh uh .  Especially one who abuses children . 
Exactly
They can´t defend themselves . 
Exactly . 
Look ,  didn´t you know that here in Chicago ,  I don´t know if you hear about the new that the Holy Virgin appeared under a bridge
yes ,  yes ,  yes a lot of people went to see it
yes ,  yes ,  I went to see her and it is true ,  the Holy Virgin appeared a Virgin , exactly ,  exactly ,  exactly like Mary the Virgin .  well ,  the others uh
the people from other races said the Virgin was theirs but not for me ,  because I am Puerto Rican
yes . 
the virgin was Holy Virgin Mary .  And the place was full of candles ,  it was full of flowers .  And instant pictures were taken
yes
And very fast ,  um they send them for three dollars but was full .  And I don´t know if you hear about the ah uh ah ,  the face of the Holy Virgin that appeared in
one of those like potato chips and that . 
Uh uh . 
And it was sold for millions at Ebay ,  millions of dollars . 
Oh yes ,  yes ,  of course . 
But those people are believer .  Then the ,  Holy Virgin that appeared here in Chicago it was under an express
Uh uh . 
it was an oil spot ,  dirt that was coming down and there the Holy Virgin was painted
Mm . 
But .  there are many believers because there were many many many lokk that the police came and block the area under the bridge so the people did´t park their cars there because
they were bothering the people who were driving by . 
yes ,  An it was a main road traffic
It was below an express
oh
Uh uh .  But ,  the Virgin came out ,  where you come out of the express in case you have a ,  uh ,  a ,  for instance if you have an accident or something ,  you take your car away
And there was the Virgin
Oh
And it was crowded every night ,  every night .  But one ,  one came ,  a Puerto Rican came who didn't believe in that ,  and said it was a lie
lie ,  and they came and painted him ,  some people who ,  um ,  who was devoted to the Virgin ,  mm ,  who worked in a car wash
yes
he came and tried to erase what he had been done ,  but they still bring flowers and candles and so ,  and it gets crowded
fifteen people go ,  and fifteen people come
yes
But I ,  I think believe in that ,  a lot .  When I saw her I said ,  at the moment ,  that is the Virgin Mary .  And I took a picture and sent it to my family in Puerto Rico
My aunt ,  since he doesn't believe in that because he is Christian
Mm
he said ,  God forgive ,  that that was fetishism ,  believing in the virgin .  I also have a friend were i used to work
Uh uh
she always said ,  mm ,  Carmen see you tomorrow God willing ,  uh uh  ,  God willing ,  the Virgin willing ,  already
I didn't dare to tell her the Virgin willing because she didn't believe in the Virgin .  And I told her
I can't talk about ,  I can't talk about the Virgin because I was taught ,  since little ,  to believe in the Virgin
And what has brought her to the top ?  yes ,  the Puerto Rican call it the Virgin Mary ,  what other name did others give her ? 
The ones from here . 
Uh uh . 
The used to call her the virgin of Guadalupe . 
Guadalupe for the Mexicans . 
Uh uh The Mexicans .  And other people used to go even native indians ,  not Americans because they have a different name for the virgin . 
But there were more Mexicans and they mention the virgin of Guadalupe
In Chicago there are many Mexicans
Uh ,  many .  And many of them are believers . 
And ,  Is that the majority of Latinos in the United States ? 
Because the church gets full of Mexicans . 
What Puerto ricans ?  yes ,  we live here in Colorado . 
Yes .  Yes . 
The majority of Hispanics here are less .

because I told my ,  my husband ,  that with my luck ,  that they will probably tell us that it will be ,  let's say ,  a boy ,  a girl ,  and comes out , 
The opposite . 
aha . 
Or what ,  it already happened with
I told him . 
with ,  the girl ?  you have a girl now . 
we also ,  also didn't find out with her ,  either . 
Ah . 
I didn't want to know because I ,  I would like to have another girl ,  but if God gives me a boy ,  I'm happy with that . 
Of course . 
But ,  i think that if I try to ,  to know before the the baby is born ,  it could be that I'm not too happy ,  so I'll better wait . 
yes ,  because afterwards ,  when you see it ,  it will be all the same for you . 
yes ,  that's why . 
Whether it's a girl or a boy . 
That's why , that's why ,  I ,  better prefer to wait ,  and that way I know that I'm not going to have ,  you know ,  because ,  I have many friends that say ,  ah ,  I want a boy ,  a girl , 
and ,  and then ,  they try to see ,  before the baby is born , 
yes ,  and then they are disappointed
and whe  yes ,  and I don't want to do that ,  I want to be happy with my baby . 
And the ,  and the clothes and that ,  the ,  if i  ? 
Well ,  that's a problem . 
Sure . 
if it's a boy ,  here they have ,  eh ,  I don't know how to say it in Spanish ,  but it's the stores that ,  that sell clothes that are already used . 
Mhm ,  second hand . 
Aha ,  so ,  what ,  our plan is ,  it's to take the girl's clothes , 
yes . 
Then ,  eh , 
Ch  change it for boy's clothes . 
aha ,  take the credit .  Then there ,  start buyin clothes for boys . 
Ah . 
But ,  you know ,  when they are little like that with one ,  two ,  three months ,  one always has it in pyjamas ,  or whatever ,  you know ,  and ,  I don't care
put him ,  if he's a boy ,  in something pink ,  whatever it is ,  until we buy the clothes . 
Mhm .  No
Really ? 
Nothing will happen ,  the child is not going to turn into
No ,  it's just that ,  he does have clothes to wear ,  that's the important thing . 
Sure ,  to keep him warm . 
Well ,  you don't need to be warm here ,  it's always hot . 
Well ,  yes ,  that's right . 
It's like ,  you know ,  I believe that it's just ,  I believe that they are ,  there are fifteen to twenty days per year when we have ,  lets say
Really ? 
to wear a sweater or long trousers ,  whatever .  You know ,  it's a bit fresh ,  not so humid but it's nothing like , 
to wear a sweater ,  it's not cold or
I'm so jealous ,  hey .  We have both here ,  extreme hot days during the summer and terrible cold during the winters . 
Well ,  it's always hot in here but of course ,  now ,  I think we went out and it's a bit cloudy today ,  it's around eighty degrees and I ,  I went out to go look for something
Mhm . 
we were outside for ten minutes and both of us came back covered in sweat because of the heath . 
Sure ,  and besides that ,  being pregnant ,  you feel the heath ,  right ? 
yes ,  but ,  yet ,  you know ,  eh ,  I ,  I think that too but when the girl is all soaked ,  you know ,  so ,  I think it's not only me who feels the heath . 
Mm ,  yes ,  and ,  are you afraid of giving birth or are you ready now ,  after your first child ? 
Eh ,  no ,  the first one ,  eh ,  he was born through a Cesarean section . 
yes
It was an emergency .  It scares me ,  I don't think much about it .  I think that ,  you know ,  my body knows what he is doing ,  I know it's going to hurt
it does ,  it hurts . 
But ,  yes but
yes
I ,  you know ,  only know that it is going to last a few hours ,  whatever
And the it's over ,  you just forget everything you've been through
yes ,  and I prefer to do it in a natural way rather than go through surgery once again
yes
That was very ,  very difficult ,  having a baby and tryng to recover at the same time
Because ,  when you had the cesarean practiced ,  did they .  . did they put you out ?  Of course ,  they have to put you out
Oh ,  no , 
And then you must wake up
no ,  they gave me that 'elastina' drug
Oh ,  then ,  you were not totally out
no .  But ,  the bad part of it was that ,  in the first place they gave it to me wrong ,  so
yes ? 
they had to try like seven times before they did it right
Oh
And afterwards ,  they gave me morphine when they finished .  That unsettled me .  I was like fourt  two and a half days with ,  eh ,  with vomits and diarrhea
Oh
it haven't stop me .  Because ,  I think that I'm allergic to Morphine ,  and no one told me that i was getting that
So ,  I don't remember anything ,  you know ,  the first days with my baby
Yes ,  it's sad
But
Someday ,  well ,  you had after recovering ,  but ,  those are really special days
Yes ,  but thanks God ,  yo know ,  my husband was there ,  and so soon
yes
the took my baby away ,  he left with him and stayed there .  So ,  you know ,  I couldn't be there ,  but he was with her the whole time
Because ,  we didn't wanted to give her feeding bottle
Mmm
I wanted to breast feeding her
Yes
And sometimes ,  here ,  at hospitals
Don't let
no ,  you're right ,  So ,  he was with her so they know that she wasn't getting bottle or anything
Mmm
Yes ,  But ,  you know ,  was an experience ,  and if God wants ,  we will have that experience one more time
No ,  sure you wont ,  now you will have a totally different one ,  but ,  if this time ,  in a Natural way ,  i think is an unique experience .  For what I've hear ,  beacuse ,  I
I haven't had any children .  However I would really want one .  I really want it .  In fact ,  I'm getting married next year
Oh ,  how good
And I am already thinking if there are possibilities .  To start a family .  The problem is that since I am a student ,  well ,  it's hard
No ,  people ,  I mean ,  it's always hard when ,  for a woman ,  when you work .  You never know what comes next ,  if ,  if you'll get fired at work ,  of you won't be able to continue
Just a second .  Sarah ,  go to your room .  Yes
But ,  yes ,  a student getting paid for ,  that's how it works here ,  they give you a scholarship ,  some money
yes
but ,  they expect results .  It's like a job ,  basically
yes
But you have less rights .  You don't have as much rights as
yes
Because ,  you are like a worker to them ,  they are paying you ,  they expect some results
yes
But you are getting an education in return .  A degree ,  so you can't demand anything .  You can't ask them for the rights that other people have in their jobs
like for instance ,  the right to vacations ,  maternal ,  I don't know how is it in spanish , 
yes
You don't have all that ,  eh ,  here .  So ,  I don't know if it will be possible .  But I would like to ,  because I don't want
don't want to delay it ,  people ,  nowdays ,  precisely for this problem ,  they start having the kids too late .  When they are thirty ,  thirty some
I don't want to wait that much .  I think the right age for having the kids is twenty some ,  don't you ? 
Well ,  we didn't wan  well ,  we didn't know we could have ki  So ,  eh ,  we are already married ,  it's thirteen to fourteen
Mhm
twelve or thirteen ,  I don't remember now .  But ,  eh ,  two weeks after we bought the house I got pregnant .  Of course I didn't get pregnant ,  I was already four months pregnant
And I hadn't even noticed .  I thought it was
What ?  ah ,  you were four months pregnant and you hadn't noticed
No ,  because I thought it was just stress ,  stress because of the moving ,  because of buying the house
Oh
you know .  Since ,  sinc we thought ,  we had been told by the doctors that we could not have children ,  so .  I never thoug 
Oh ,  really ?  and how ?  look ,  they were wrong ,  thank goodness
yes ,  so
And how did you finally notice ? 
eh ,  because I have a medical condition that causes me a big pain .  What happened is that I was feeling a great pain .  And I was thinking that it was coming back
yes
So ,  I went to the doctor .  And then I was told .  You know ,  I spent the whole pregnancy with a big pain
Oh
Because I've had a lot of ,  eh ,  I've had four operations
Mhm
I've had plenty of problems
yes
And ,  that's why I had that much pain
And was it the reason ,  was it the reason for the cesarean also ? 
No ,  the cesarean was due to ,  honestly ,  because the doctor didn't want to wait
Oh ,  e 
He ,  he ,  my husband hear him telling the ,  the ,  I don't know how is it in spanish , 
Oh ,  yes ,  me either ,  midwife I think ,  aha
mm ,  ok ,  that he didn't want to ,  mm ,  that he was scared that we would give him ,  eh ,  we would ,  mm ,   ,  , 
a lawsuit
yes
Eh ,  because I was ,  I didn't have ,  wait ,  leave me alone ,  wait a second .  I was ,  supposedly ,  they said I was of fourty two weeks
Mhm
Forty one weeks

  the recording .  It said something about religion ,  about if it is the division ,  if it is that religion divides or if it actually

  brings people together . 
Exactly . 
That is the subject .  .  .  am I correct ?

Yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes .
