Well, and what do you think about tonight's topic?
lots of movies, right? They don't have a sense of, many of them are about gangs, about lots of gangs or gang members, and they go to watch them because it's like
society, the parents, families, they have a lot to do with it, they should help the children understand what those things are and how to avoid them, right? I talk to my girl and I don't, when
Do you have teenagers?
if he wants to do that if he wants to have sex with a girl these are the consequences that that he might get-, what might happen, you understand?
Ay, I was thinking, my god, how can it be? Hey, today we got a very difficult subject
Where are you from?
they twist what is happening and then always I find myself with people who, for example, tell me damn, what do you think of the crazy man you have as a president? and
I wanted to say, that, so later they have said a few stupid things, no?
and you try to tell the other person, look it's like this, like this.. don't you realize?  And then they tell you no, because you are
Exactly, that is what they tell me sometimes, "what are you doing here?
because, what do you do over here ? all right, could be same as you, thank God. You being here, and not in Venezuela
for really unusual high price, the people can't cope with that, they don't protest either, and i say, my God, what's happening with all those people?, like
however i tell you,  don't know, suddenly here, you live in Pennsylvania like you told me, right ?
me too, at the beginning there wasn't I didn't have access to that, to that page I said, My Good, could it be true what they are saying about Venezuela? But I talked with my friends
and they said, no, girl, what is that? Look, and I, damn really, but look the power of television is
Of course, of course, what do you do there in Philadelphia?
Oh, and do you think it is best over there than in Miami?
And, what are we going to do?  That is, work is the main thing.
Of course, of course, and fi- and come over here  And what do you do?
But, and do you have much time here in the United States?
Twelve?
Then, I also before saw the Americans like gringos, then this one, now i understand that don't, that they are Americans and united states, because that is another wrong concept they manage, no ? Then,
why?  Why?
Well, my name is Ibet, and you are..?
Hello Mercedes, How are you? Where are you from Mercedes?
Oh, from Honduras?
Ah Where from?
And, where are you from?
Ah. Where from? The Capital City?
And what do you think aboout today's topic? is it easier to break with someone young or, the age makes a difference.
did you ever have a difficult break up?
yes?
eh, I'm going to have 3 kids and building castles in the air and when he came once and told me, you know what? here we are over
what?
That´s good. It´s better.What for? Trouble, to get in trouble
And you?
yes, and how does that happened to you?
Are you married now?
Eh, What else? Let's see which other one. After that I didn't have any other formal boyfriend until S- yes, the truth is I never had any bad experiences I don't know, really? Thank God.
I think that must be one of the worse, I think, experiences, yes, I hope, I hope I never have to go through that cause we don't know, right?
it's impossible to have a perfect relationship, right? A situation in which
yes, one loves the person but it's impossible to be at peace all the time, that's what I mean, right?
Because one, then I, I am one, is a human being and one has to, things that bother to other people, right? and
yes, the truth I fe-, I think it has to be some truth, eh it's difficult eh, keep all happy, right? but
that, of course, you don't fully know, right? until you get married with that person but I think that I think
the drama is al-eh lots really? and then the people don't know how to get out the cycle of ,of abuse is what happens
And i told her, now your wearing glasses? and she had a black eye because her boyfriend hit her.
and then i said wow, what? how can you love a person that hits you? she sometimes came with bruises or sometimes
What's up Fabiola?, How are you?
Fine, and you?
Nice!, Where are you?

look and you  Are you arepa?
Hmm Oh Do you work at the Hilton?
Do you work?
Ah, OK, OK. Chilean, of course, no?
yes, yes, yes. Now I'm- it's important orally. No? I'm like in the mid- at the other extreme of the of, of, mm, of the, mm,
And ho-? To speak?
But, definetively they'll have that option, then. And even, eh, there are paretns that combine, the signal language with the oral part, No? depending on
What do you think about, about the subject they gave us of the-?
eh, sometimes is a little bit difficult, no? But, I think love is the only thing that can make overcome these barriers, nothing else
are overcome, what do you think?
and twelve, imagine that, i mean we've had critical moments but, never enough to separate, and there's a time where maturity plays a big role, right?
As I say, if I fall down, i just put myself up, What's the problem?
Exactly, the luckily, well, the first time was horrible, I thought it was the end of the world. And well, there we stood and we weren't treating each other fine, until one day, i said, well, what's going on?
horrible, really horrible, I said, look, you know what?, I think
Because, what will we do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre relationship. As you say, there are some people who spend up to 30 years together, and in a crappy relationship
yes?
They, they mistreat each other. Like, you piece of who knows what, like, what's that? Why would I want-?
Right? you just respect, and
right?and there's some that say, that love, yes theres no love, no nothing.
of course of course, is your husband from chile?
you think it's easier?
and what, what's what you said?
what do you say? or when we're super b-
Hi, hi, how are you?
Oh, how are you?
Fine, and you?
That's great, and where are you originally... ?
Right? Me too
Really?
And how long have you been living here?
and his name?, and then came and went clear but more or less in the ninety-one , and you?
and you, where you from?
from Santiago too?
and some time you are in this? call by phone?
oh yes?
Hello?
Oh, are you already calling everyday?
Ah, why union shouldn't be or why one doesn't want to do it?
Yea. Yes, and do you like it here?
yes, well. and as but roamed beyond people use as car or more action?
and they tried to speak to me in Arab, I don't know. They found my face to be more Indian or something, but of course. Is there discrimination there or no?
English and then they have to go around but not like other people, you know how in every place, they are average
yes. yes. Of course.
of course.
yes but.
of course for example in the rural areas of Georgia you would see things like you see the Ku Klux Klan I don't know
Oh, yes really.
Oh, mm
And those weird things but is very very far from the city I mean
Eh.
Eh.
Oh, Oh, how weird.
And how did you end up in Idaho?
Oh I married a Gringo.
yes. I married a gringo, that's how I came here.  And you how, how?
oh really?
yes, and so that's why we came to we went to Seattle in ninety one, I was about eleven years old
Mm.
Oh. okay
Mm. okay
And so you're single now?
Yes something like that, I am like we live together
Oh, okay
Well then sure.
okay Ah, look. And what's this called, do you like it or not?
on they way from San Felipe to the Andes that is like a question more more rural and you couldn't imagine how
Oh
typical Chilean countryside and I loved it.
It was a village, what do I know. I like to be inside the city because I know there's more going on, like you know, there are more things to do.
yes, I can Imagine
half
same in contact, is difficult also
Here, yes, same but not so much. Not so much. Like when, even, at least less mall, is not too big.
Hi, ¿how are you?, my name is Juan, Marcela.
Yeah, ¿how're you doing?
Hey, ¿didn't we talk the other day with?
Yeah, i think so, you're in Texas and I'm in North Carolina.
Oh, yeah, me too.
I haven't forgotten you. We practiced together, ¿right?, Hey, but today's heath.
¿Do you have insurance here?, ¿are you covered?
Uh, I'm covered through my husband.
Uh, uh.
Oh, well, look, we're. We're not.
That's a problem, right?
We're not covered. It's a problem, because there's always something that could happen, right?
And the, yeah. And the other day i went precisely to a, an office in which they supposedly give some kind of, i mean, pension for
people from the community, right?
Yes
And well the papers that they asked me with my address and proof of work. And, finally they found an excuse to not, not giving it to me because they asked me
to give information about the person that was hiring me and at that time well, that person didn't want to give the information, no?
Mm.
and and, in my case, I have a son with epilepsy.
And, then he needed some some emergency attention here things that
and didn't they give you, eh, the attention?
eh, no. No, no. They didn't want to give me the prescription. Right. So in the cases that press with him, he was in a bad way once, yes. He became worse.
no? yes, he gave me. Then yes, it's something that we thing about that well, there should be some type of more flexible, no, in order to well in case there is for the community but it's a certain type of community.
the costs of, the cost of everything, depends on demand. And so if those costs keep on going up, up and up
because there is more demand and because people pay for it. And so the costs keep on going up because people ask for more money. And the people that work ask for more money, it's a vicious circle. And so how can you all of a sudden create a social medicine?
The money doesn't stop being like a drug, you see.  They are already used to a certain amount of money.
And then now, suddenly they are not going to have it.
Exactly.  It is a problem, it is a circle that works with earnings here they are stronger, no?
Then the interest is wors
We would stop making bombs and going to war.  Look, all that money that could be put
on schools or in a medical system, social medicine.
Mm. Yes.
With that.  Because here I don't know there where you are living.  But, here if someone has money it is nurses and doctors.  No?
Then.  Mm. And well here as they say, you see a good car with a woman who is thirty, for example, no?
yes.  Tell me, twenty, thirty dollars an hour.
yes, yes I Uh uh.  Then who in this case well it is offered.  In Canada I understand well they have much medicine, no?
No, but the difference is that they started right.
Yeah, it's like in Argentina, my parents have their full medications paid
Uh, uh
All their medicines are paid, they pay a little, ¿right?, but very little.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the other thing, you could at least try to pay something.
It's expensive, ¿right?; And then, i don't know how the medications are here, but well, in Mexico they're cheaper and its more like that
in other places around the world. Everywhere around the world.
Uh, uh
Uh, and then, uh, we went to Argentina last year, i went to the drugstore and i showed them something that was over fifty dollars here
i bought it there for twelve dollars
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Twelve dollars, the same brand and all.
with some ingredients
Mm.
no? yes yes and here there is only one. And secondly the literature isn't the best. And if it is only the laboratories, and I think that all the NorthAmerican laboratories well eh
Strong interest in all, no?
Mm.
Well what do I know, apparently that things yes like that
But.
yes.
Why don't you put yourself in contact with an organization that is called Shriners?
Uh uh. ah yes.
Ehm, because they help the children.
Mm.
yes.
Uh uh.  Uh uh.  Well yes look, yes
yes I knew that.  Hey, we ran out of time or what?
yes.  Maybe I am making a mistake in not finding out you see it doesn't cost anything.
And also if you call the Catholic Charities
Uh.  Uh uh. That is true.
There are lots of samples. And, but knowing a little bit more about the advances. Its because I can give out the medicine we think that one diagnostic more profound could improve the lifestyle of my son with
with the epilepsy, right?
because It had been under control, but lately he has as close to two years that It has been disconnected. He has been out of control.
And, well, yes, they gave him another one. They leveraged him and it didn't work so by no means, he had to take it off and return to the basics.
what
yes, yes, you know, it is matter of experimenting.
well yes, sometimes yes.
all the time yes.
life without you telling me is always pending, all the time.
right? then you know one is always hoping that it doesn't happen. Well I don't really know what really is going to happen, but right it does cause trauma, but poor son of mine because he is a teenager so
Hmm
It happens in school and he feels really bad.
Sure, because on top of that he feels embarrassed. Look, how old is he?
yes, it's a stigma. It's a stigma. What he has, no? then
How old is he?
seventeen
ah, sure, he's a teenager
Eh, yes, well, returning to the subject, I think he should try with some good
yes. Do you know where you can ask around? in the teaching hospitals
System of, eh
With the doctors. The medical centers that have medical schools
Uh
Sometimes the different departments there
yes
they'll see people that, that can't pay in a normal situation, you know? Like us who can't go to a specialized doctor because it's too expensive
hmm
And we don't have that much money
Hmm, yes
And they, they make notes of what they give you. And they charge accordingly. Something that always is, uhmm
Mm.
Of month. and that, is is this interesting. I had to make myself an abscess. I it turns out that I have a thing that is called ADD
and they didn't charge me anything and they did all the exams.
Ah, yes?
yes.
with the University. Ah?
I told them.
Mm. Uh uh.  Then, they told me no well you have to bring us information.  I had a letter about my income, etc., no?
They didn't want to give you that information.
no? wel not I.  But well then now I have my social security, myself.
Mm.
Maybe now you can
Uh uh.
Hello, how are you? my name is Juan
Hello, well eh, Mateo here
I am in San Antonio.  Mateo, I think we had already talked, you are in Philadelphia
yes, how, how have you been?
listen, well all good this, what do you think about today's topic?
no, I didn't hear it, what is the topic?
the topic are technical gadgets, I mean technology, the gadgets you use the most and that you depend on then and if, how do you consider that dependence
and how do you consider the matter of technology, no?, your daily life, if it becomes more of a problem than a solution or something like that
this includes, automobiles, cars?
it is the same that, it is the same I was thinking, clearly, they should include it, no?
yes because it is a, you know? a machine
exactly, well, but, I said well yes, the automobile seems to be the most important, no?, it is- then I thought maybe it is the computer, but no
yes, the most obvious one is the computer well, but, it is not the only
aha, exactly but sometimes, eh, what seems like a more personal element depending on the case, well it can be the car, no? because the computer is more and more another tool
well more than, than, sometimes, let's say that it belongs to the institution in which you are, no? it is more a work tool
ah
but a tool like very personal seems to be the car, no?
yes, and because of that, the same thing you buy a car and you are always using it and you always have to maintain it, you always have, it is some part of your life
because, you have to be careful with the car and, you know?
yes yes, exactly, besides like I am here in Texas
Okay
I believe that here the car culture is something like a reminiscence of the horses culture also
did you use horses more?
no? is like a horse, it is something like very, very, very personal, very closed
yes
to, to your life. here take care of them and the is as important as, let't say, as the horse at that time, no?
yes
Some years ago and, and well, well if don't say, so in our time of communication the most important devices are going to be the related with communication, the computer
eh, everything that allows the handling of the information and everything, right?
yes, because, here in Texas yes, but even there in Texas
but
You need the car, you know? to, to work
yes
so
exactly and here working people have like in that times like a mule, no? they need a a, a pick up a, truck pick up
really?, yes, yes
pick up truck, right? and listen, and it does not leave them, then is, eh, it is evident, like it is a hard work culture very, very important
right
and the computers, well, in every home there's television, telephone and computers basically, isn't it? but but like there are other dimensions of the technological cuestion, then the automobile seems to be
of the most most important
yes, but... the cuestions on the topic were what
ah, what a- what technical, technological question is more important in your life? that's what we're discussing right now, if it should be the automobile or the computer, what do you think?
well, for mi it would be more my computer and my cell phone
aham, exactly
because, you know? because i have my cell phone and I'm always with it
aham
and, well I've grown accustomed to having a cellphone, you know?
aham
back then, i didn't had a cell phone until i was like twenty, but now that a- that i live in Philadelphia in the city and that I'm not always going back home fo-
not always going back home for for, you know? seeing my messages
yes, yes
well I'm always always, always having my cellphone
having your cellphone
i think it's very it's like surprising that almost everyone has a cellphone here in the united states
yes notice that it is, it's verry important what you just said, some time ago when i was working i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important thing, was it?
yes
and well, on the computer were the messages, there was always the internet, the mails more than the phone, the cellphone, anything, right?
yes
the computer was the most important
but now
but now,with the type of work that I am doing the car is the most important .the computer because the car is what permits re-type of job that I am doing
more phisical,no? then the car becomes the most important tool and the computer well, in a second plan even though it is also very important no?
well it is because the type of work well
well for me I believe that well you and you where around Texas and obiously you know that there is more how you say? i understand that there is more buildings and stuff around there you know?
LOT MORE SPACE
yes yes
for in the, in the city having a car can be an inconvenience as well.
yes, yes, that yes
because you have to try and park and have to pay to park and the gas station is not close. and I don't know es
is more of a problem then a help because a help but obviously you know? obviously
ah,yes?
better to have a car I think
yes eh,yes because of the distance I have to travel in my work the car is more fundamental
yeah sure
but yes and in the city I believe the most imortant and depending on your work also well eh could be the computer no? then
the the other question o,o the tools of communication no? like you say the cellular.
yeah
and that and eh, and the uestion is if you consider that you are eh this technology becomes more a problem then then in
well, what kind of problems could he have, right? like you said, with the car, the problems that have to do with the parking.
right
no? here in Texas no, there isn't, where I'm from there is not  major problems, no?, with the parking there is a lot of space everywhere, he hasn't presented
Lets say, those problems here, but in the end, I don't know, I don't know what your opinion is, above everything I would say that, well, in regards with the cars, matter of cars and all that well it doesn't look like a big problem unless
we could consider a problem the interests created around the, motor industry and like so sometimes they affect the growing of technology.
of transport, right? for example
right, but don't you think that, that its very awesome that it changed in about sixty years.
yes
a, yes we seen how sixty-five years ago there wasn't any cars, but nowadays everyone has it
yes,yes, yes but, yes
and the same thing with computers they have, they have computers that wont go off the market for like ten years because
well
because they have those things very advanced and the things have not cumbri- have not cum-
yes
charged their development costs, you understand me? I can't explain it very well but
Exactly yes, well like they say too, with the motor industry, right? if the motor industry would have advanced technologically much like the electronic industry then maybe an automobile will let us transport like
one hundred kilometers with one liter of gas.
right
right? and instead of costing like twenty thousand dollars, it would only cost ten thousand dollars.
yes
if that was the case, no? but, like the technology, in this case the industry, has their interests well no, like it does not advance, no? you can see already what they are saying now about the hybrids.
that no, most of them say that they are not feasible and that in reality it is only a matter of image that the companies manage and when the time comes to see the, the scoreboard
regarding hybrid automobiles well I thought that they were going to be much more efficient I think that the efficiency they have achieved is minimal
yes
no?, no, I don't think that they have a real, a real, ehm that it is really a change like that very importanttechnological given the efficiency that
yes, that was an important change
pardon?
you don't think that it is an important change, or
no, I don't think that it is that important at the same time that the efficiency they have proven is not radically different to the ones others have it is very little, no? you see, I say
oh
a, a,according to the rules an economy car drives you it could be thirty-six miles per gallon
aha
and a hybrid can drive you fifty
oh no, ehm yes sure, sure that, there are cares around right now like the, the Fords
oh so
the pick up trucks are good they are changing to be more efficient you know?
OK
but the expedition those cars are big so they are expensive you know? only they can go twenty miles, ten and eight miles per galon or something like that that's a huge expense
yes exactly  but at the same time cars like this, there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance that hybrids and they aren't hybrids no?
by small cars, news that are not in the North American market, they are in the European market or Latino American where they have to be more efficient
oh yes
and smaller no? then if we compare with the spend of a hybrid against a small Europe car or those that run in latinoamerica so
it goes out more expensive have a car for the initial spend and for what you can save in gasoline finally
its less that you have a car very low cost no
and why is that
European
because the united states is one of the ony nations that have this you only have big cars here you know
yes i am yes
there in other countries  have smaller cars its good a different culture you know but
yes i just a few years ago the oil problem, in the eighties or something like that i don't remember
OK
i thought i was having an exchange of culture because they started to develope little more here in the united states
yes but
i thought well i was going to have an exchange of culture but that was nothing by the time no it seems because they have a big cars they keep like
I am Ana Maria
Oh Faviola, hi
Hi Faviola
How are you?
Good and yourself? How is the weather like in your house?
Very nice, sunny or cold
sunny and cold, oh
cold
Over here weather is ugly, it is cold.  What do you think about the movies? Have you talked already about this topic?
yes
I also had that topic before
I did not had that topic before and I had to talk about it, specifically the person I had to talk to talked about violence
mhm
No, he liked the idea of going to see movies.  I told him, the world is the world.  It has violence
mhm
Always had, and have the experience to teach children abroad peace and love on television oh, oh in the world and later when they face the real world which is the school
You find that, little kids hit him, that they do not know how to defend themselves.  Moreover, when you have only children
OK
then oh, I find that it is good the classification they have, I believe that is the adults responsibility, until when the children can watch television
I agree, the maximum responsibility lies within the parents
The are doing their job the one who make movie and
they are earning money, what is your job,
in their business, you
doing their business, yes
yes, now the one who wants it, take it, who wants to see it, do not want to see it, is not their responsibility, they see
of, yes
that sells
yes
And is what they do, it is not their fault, is the fault of the ones who buy
yes, the one who likes the product, for that reason
yes
With you that is the most responsibility, whether is in violence, of sex, of what ever you want to protect a, a child in.  The responsibility is of the parents, even if there is a classification.
Because, if there is a movie classification, for example, PG thirteen
yes
If you have younger child and if you let him/her watch the movie is your responsibility
yes
is because you let him/her and you thought it could be, is that right?
exactly
So then, because I, the the association, or, or, or whoever places, places the classification, already have it then,
I think if, imagine, we think more or less the same in that Faviola because, at the end you realize that the responsibility or raising and take care and of what you want them to see and not see
Your children, or your family. Eh, your mother or your husband like mother
MM i think i totally agree and the other, normally the children have access to television whenever parents are not home
Exactly
children are alone
mhm
And there isn't a father there to show or teach, you can't view this, view that
And if they make a sleepover, you don't know either
Right, no you don't have a clue
If they go a sleepover and they put a movie, watch it in that house without control and whatever
You never know
Exactly
I think the important is give them one. To respect that rules and if you give them good principles at home. Your family, ans show him things
Right
Exactly that i don't like or i don't like it. You must see if you're prepared, the moment will surely come
Why, because like they say, you can't have them in a crystal box
No, and besides
yeah, exposed (boy) or exposed (girl)
yes, and when they reach a certain age. My son had around 15 years and he tells me, Don't worry you've the best you could
mhm
ah, 25% is the genes and education and the rest decision, my life decisions
Look, with that
Sure, then I learned. Oh, wait, no eh, oh, I was and
mm
My cell phone was ringing. OK, OK wait and I'll answer.
OK
Eh, don't hang up because we need to talk for twelve minutes.
yes
It, I only went to turn it off.
OK ah
And about the people, I think, on the movies I love to watch horror films.
Yeah
But sometimes that, that I'm scared, I'm a adult.
You, you scare yourself,
I get scared and I'm going to find out about horror movies.
Yes, yes, but your responsibility is to watch it, and you scare yourself
yes
Yes, I don't like them and I don't watch them, I don't watch any kind like that. That is why it's my decision bec- even if I have the age to watch it, if it's too aggressive, I don't want to watch it.
Yes, that's why, that's why I respect what my son told me that time, fifty per cent is responsibility,
yes
of, of the individual, of the person, eh, you already did the best you could, but it comes an age in boys before they are eighteen
Some are more mature than others,
yes
and they start watching rated r movies.
mm
at the age of fourteen and fifteen, and eleven and twelve year olds are watching pg 13 movies.
yeah right.
and sometimes even kids, and even younger kids, because i remember, my friend jenny had a kid that watched harry potter.
yeah thirteen yeah
PG thirteen PG fourteen, so i say, jenny doesn't like that, she gets scared.
yeah
she's scared of monsters, and all that
yeah
but i agree, that the major part is the criteria that you make of it, to take care of them if they don't want too.
yeah why, why
not just leave them with the tv.
but imagine if you cant control it.
but its only tv.
that's what i mean, you can control it, you need to be more mature, it isn't true.
we need to have criteria formed, to watch movies.
yeah that's why i said you don't get anything good out of watching it, like at his friends house.
aha, in the same school they show them movies.
Oh the same school, but the same school is a little more supervised because that's already another thing. Because they have a purpose.
They show them documentaries.
But what I fear the most is when they go to their friend's house. And they sometimes have the television right there in the room, which is so customary nowadays, or the computer or whatever.
And they have access to information without their parents, without their parents having any idea. And they are in the room their parents think that they are listening to music or whatever
Perhaps they are watching something inappropriate. That's why, I mean what happens, is that if my daughter or son or whatever it is,
faces that situation he has to learn to value himself, And learn to respond to that, That's what I say, in other words, trying to instill in him the home values.
Follow like superman the little boy that climbed on the window and got killed.
of course, because you know they are still not prepared.
aha
eh, did you read the rules that are in this, phone game.
yes Okay
I was asking myself, ah how is this? are you getting ready for Christmas yet?
yes, yes, yes I'm getting ready I'm already buying the gifts for the family. But now I have, I have other things on my mind.
is your birthday no.
Buy something for the adults, a little something, either way I'm going to make the majority of the gifts.
That's what I was going to tell you
I'm going to cook, yes ah
cook and boil. To boil that thing you made, that thing you gave me
Two days before Miranda
Andreita has her birthday too. Oh, three
What did you buy Miranda?
Por te pre- one of those screens where you draw and then can erase it
Ah, how nice
Because she likes them, she, she already knows them, and she likes them, she draws little lines and then she erases them, and, I won't give the to her yet because they're very small and she'll put them in her mouth
But meanwhile, you'll give her the pencil and the screen
Ah, how nice
But yes, because little things like that
I'm excited.
Of course, you see, then. Those things like that are nice to do, so I bought the same thing for little Andrea. And that was it,
And you know who else has a birthday coming?
Yeah, who?
On the same date
who?
that I remember from when I was there
My father in law, who
Your father in law, yes
yes, it's true, who?
Him, him, Juan Luis, Sandra's youngest son.
Oh, yes, yeah
Also on the twenty- the twenty ninth. I also remember that more or less around the same date, I remember that they were all around the same date.
I don't remember of his of being in I didn't know at least.
I haven't gone to any birthday to Sandra's house. I went to only one, but I don't remember, to tell you the truth.
Eh, it was in April, then, when i went to Chile it was April
OK, that was another birthday, she has three.
No, but Sandra will not celebrate her birthday, she won't have a party that year
no, no, okay
No, she said no, just for the family, because they're going to buy something better for the kid
yes, it's true
And really, she makes parties that are too big
she spends too much, yes
too much, she spends too much on that and they can't buy what they really want for the kid
what they really want, exactly
they, of course. They have to decide between one or the other, so yes, this year, the kid decided he wants just the family
Jua, Juan Luis is the eldest or the youngest?
The youngest of all
ah, okay
And, and he says, I don't want any clothes
Poor thing
I don't want books, only toys
Carolina.
Tamara, ¿how are you?, uh
Yeah, ¿and you?
Fine, fine. ¿Uh, where are you?
I'm in Seattle, Washington state
Wow, I'm in Los Angeles.
Oh, yeah
Yes, it's just incredible
Yeah
Right now i was making a phone call, and suddenly, i mean, i didn't think today was sunday, i was more asleep than awake, and i, ¡Oh my god!
Yeah, you caught me off guard. But, ¿have you been participating long in this?
Yeah, this is, i think this is my twenty three call.
Oh, ok, ok, yeah, because i got an email that they're taking back people that are participating again, uh, because at first you could only participate once
Yes
Didn't you, you got the same email, ¿right?, i mean, that apparently this will continue, you see, according to what i understood from the email they sent me.
Yeah, i, it's
It's more like, right, tell me
Then, what do you think about what they show in the movies?
Say? Well I will tell you honestly, it's been more than a year since we stopped watching movies movies in the regular cinema and we move to the cinema
not so "Conventional"
aha
We moved to the cinema, for example in case of cinema, no? same as the one on television. Now we watch movies like Documentaries. Well... eh, with a different type of message.
Watch movies that are on on eh, what do you call it? the festivals, there we go for example, the recently finished International Festival of Latinamerican Cinema
upid, so dum that I felt bad to be there in the movie theater. I, well, what are we doing here? What a waste of time this is
What are you doing, right? I mean to watch that, really I prefer aco- lay down and go to sleep or I'd rather do something else instead of of, no I'm saying all of the movies, there are some that have a
a pretty different message, that's worth seeing but lately I've felt like they're making movies, like to make them
uh huh exactly.
uh huh, like great we have to make ten movies; we're going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter what? When? How it turns out, to the
forget about it, like we say, where are you from?
I'm from Panama
Ah, okay I'm from Venezuela
Oh okay
Aha, yes
in, then yes it's true, it's true
We say thus to "Macha" no, because good, if they make films like they want to but yes they leave good ones leave and others, if they don't leave don't leave but
Honestly no. And the same is passing right now with the television. We had cable and now he just has a question of we cut it to a month because no, I don't know suddenly like
that we put ourselves against what we saw that there was a lot of manipulation of the average ones they only pass the news to you that agrees with them they hide the truth
eh then that is concerning those of the reporters and the films then if that's not one film that's really very good very good
but then they repeat and repeat and repeat. Ay My God! What is this? we are paying for this then it's like an annoyance, right now we have like an annoyance with
with mass media we are thus reluctant, yes yes.
I think aha.
Because whenever you see something or they give something to you well stupid
Exactly.
or you have it or they exaggerate to you enough
Exactly.
Ay maginate
And we were there and my husband, you know? this white man, paper white compared to my father and my mother is white so I left more than my father, so
when we left you know that he was American.
Logical, logical.
and say hey, weren't we there this morning? i don't remember seeing that this morning.
exactly.
exactly.
exactly
because its not true. and that
so bad what happened.
oh yeah
no no he doesn't remember.
I see
he was there and people was protesting, Why?, the current President didn't do anything to remember the local victims
I think they were called Los de Richos, Chinos. That zone practically disappeared, the whole town
of from Chorrillo
yes, from Chorrillo, exactly
yes, that's were he was. That's were was the police, or part of the polce
which happened a long time ago, then they put it here in Venezuela and I don't know. The Other day i wrote to one of the journalist
which is crazy, what it's really happening is that the press is changing the information, so he appears to be a monster, a dict
ator, well a dictator, we have gone through four elections and for referendums, i can't be more democratic. But it is his personality, his personality is
one in a million, and people don't accept that. It's not a common man, and people don't accept it, then he is the first criticizing that
But specifically, i watch the government's channel there, the national channel. Because the other channels are from the opposition, so of course it's a little bit more of the same.
from the whole world, you compare, this is what is happening there, ah and that also happens with the radio, we listen to public radio, radio that you feel is
they are really saying the truth or at least, you have a different point of view, I mean we don't get the whole truth but sometimes, it's not as
biased as the other one, I don't know, I can't say that what the others say is
aha
false but they do manipulate the information
yes
I don't know if you
Hello?
did you watch, I'm not sure, did you watch a movie named "Auto Fox"
No, I might have, I don't remember
It's a documentary about Fox News
mhm
and well it's about people that used to work there and they said they were forced to lie, they quit the channel and they got together and they started to complain
on a local level, local, to tell the world what's happening there, in Fox News. It's quite interesting, it's something like
"The workers from Fox that are out"
some
Something like "out" from outside
aha
and Fox of Fox News
My name is
Hello my name is Fernanda
Hello Fernanda How are you? My name is Claudia
How are you?
Where are you from? Good. How are you speaking?
from Washington
ah. Which of the two
Washington DC
ah, b
yes Washington State
ah, already and the other
and you're from, where are you from?
Yes I am here in the state of Idaho and I don't know if you know it
yes yes of course
if this truth because I see lot of that in the movies a lot of truth in my view I don't really quite agree with them
they are not ranked very well you know. Eh, for example they sometimes say it's PG and then you see it eh that movie and really
they have pornography  sometimes and later it'sPG thirteen Sometimes it's not is more calm
and does not have as many things as nudity or profanity to be true to those classifications for me it's not like that sometimes
We don't know the people that critique these movies, and we don't know the classification o, or we don't know what it was from your point of view
Yes, I don't know much about the truth of films
aha
Lets say, I don't have children or nothing like that, then almost I notice...
aha
But I think that the majority of television that are, lets say, if you see during the mid-day that is when a lot of times the kids are at home.
yes
I think that hm the Americans are, not like the mo- standard morals have decreased, You understand me? then
yes
Now lots of things are like normal, that, that I think it will not be.
yes, it is true because, hm and is true because hmm, one time, well I don't have cable dont have, the normal channels, the ones to see.
But for example, I had one, one time cable and sometimes was,well, what you like? ten in the morning, eleven and well I like to be changing the channel.
mhm
And sometimes passing movies that really, uf, if a child of ten years old or nine was in the house and was looking him, it was changing also at the same time that I, I
I stop in that channel, they were things but very, already adult.
Clearly, and
imagine for a moment what type of caricatures are going, well, I remember that one time I was watching TV. Pay attention, in Mexico, I am the city of Mexico
The channel here is 16, then I it was a caricature in English because already at night there is something in English, something in Spanish
and it was a cartoon in English. So I left it on. And, it was my mom, well, peaceful, because she was watching a channel of cartoon
How horrible
She turned off the TV and she had to explain a little because my mom, it surprised her because I had put on a channel of cartoons a normal channel
Then, already the truth, already no already the cartoons don't survive
Yes and that could happen to whichever child that was watching TV
sometimes the cartoons yes
And you cannot be inside let's say if a kid changes you can't skip or see, you have to have faith that , let's say, at least during the day
Yes
The programming does not have any nudity or crudity or nothing like that
yes, yes it's true. But there are not really the cartoons sorry, the Japanese cartoons are are those which have more classification eh, have. In Mexico eh,
of that kind of television, any channel, the, channels, for example that is the five in cartoons
yes
for example, then arrives at ten o'clock at night, eleven and you can watch the TV and they don't transmit so unpleasant programs. Well
in Mexico District, mhm
before, in Mexico. But for example, if you are watching a cable channel you take the risk that the cartoon could be about something sometimes about some
I p-yes, and pi-look, I am from Colombia and I think that in Colombia neit-
Then, oh okay
the television is  much better than here in that way.
because, ca-can be, let's say ten at night and the series on air never are so, you don't take the risk, do you? to be too poor like here. Here
Then her kid was watching eh, the a cartoon channel and then the girl thought to change to TV and em- and wa other channel that was also programmed to them, to kids.
oh, yes?
Aha, but you could still see it and I got and told her to, to her mom and she said, oh, there is not problem, that is a channel of
of, of cartoons, of, of they air programs.  And, to tell you the truth I was I was, did not, they did not leave much to the imagination.  It was really like the pose of, well ehm it was an operating room where the woman was having her baby.
Because they are twins, she iss, ehm, both of them are six years old.  And their mom was letting them watch that, well each, each parent lets them see what they
well what they see. no? in that aspect. But, uf
yes no
I think
yes, it is of those, for real those classifications they give. And n- and n- and, of the mainly of the television.  The truth already, already n-
how much __, mom is at home and has her small children of three, four years old, five or more or they are at home and they see, they are watching her soap opera
and always ar- they show scenes where they are the, the, a couple, they are there having sex.
Mmm
And during the day, because sopa operas are on air from six in the morning until night
of course
And they are like that, leaving nothing to imagination
Yes, I
Then, programs are now rated, ans whatching a pornogrpahic scene in TV an any time is normal, and for many
parents, it's becoming, unfortunately, normal
exactly
And I think that if parents talk to the broadcaster, and demand for a more restricted television, of this kind of scenes
I think it would be a little better. But, now, parents are fine if the children watch something like that, there is not problem
if a movie has a sex scene or rude language, for the buyers, well they will laugh
and sometimes, it brings attention because it's a really strong scene. Then, those things sometimes help to
producers to sell
sometimes, and
Then no, Personally I like movies like, I like Disney movies, or
child movies, I like them
Yes,yes
Even if I'm tired I love them. I have some Disney movies here and honestly i don't like movies
of course, of course
The way things are going soon even the ones from Disney, perhaps will have pornography, right? So
one really doesn't know how they will change
no, no, the truth is, this is going honestly too far, you turn on the television and if you, you already see a commercial
of feminine pads and they appear there and they are going to explain there how, and in a while they will put a naked woman and they will
show there how they are putting on the pad.
exactly
Because sometimes they even draw it. I don't know if you've seen commercials like that. All the same it doesn't scare you because you're already big, right? but
but if for example a boy or a girl is watching it and you say if the mom is there she can explain it to them in a good way, and if a friend is there
and they tell them, they can explain it with bad information so,
and even one gets used to it, do you understand me? let's say
then yes
like sometimes I see it and like you don't realize how much things have changed.
Good night, my name is Mariza, from Philadelphia.
Mariza, Mariza.
Maybe it's... Mariza, we spoke to each other a few days ago, right?
Hey, well, today's subject is, the matter of religion, right?
Yes, it's a very complicated and polemic subject.
Right.
Give an answer for. And it ends up being some form of control, right?
They try to control the country through religion and, it may seem positive or negative for a lot of people, because it helps to pray and/or believing in something, for some it helps, and for others...
Right
That, well, they represented a whole project of, ideology, but they really, they're one of the most conservative groups there are in the United States, right?
Uh, yeah.
So, they had a power very, well, very direct, very clear, trying to influence people there at the church.
At the sermon, what specially caught my attention, against the public schools.
directly against public school, and they prayed that god will rid us from public school some day.
¿Really?
Because if
Oh, oh no.
And against the theory, that they try to teach the theory about evolution, ¿right?
Oh, yeah, I've heard that, yes.
No, terrible, they said ¿why are they harassing teachers that teach the bible to explain how the world was created?
Exactly, yes, there are a lot of trouble, yes.
Right, they're fundamentalists, right?
Yeah, the right-wing fundamentalists, yeah, yeah. But also, the country is, uh, the party in power is, that everyone, from the president to the, everyone in it is, on the white house they're all right-wing conservatives.
The right to abortion, the right to, for example, like the other question, to homosexuality, gay marriages, the right to believe
yeah, more scientific right?, no, you don't have to believe only in what they say, they say god created man and woman, but also to give children a choice to believe
What was Charles Darwin theory of evolution. And
yes
And is very complicated also, of, the other question was over the homosexuality, yes, yes, yes we all were the same or believe the same, it wont be problems like this, he question.
yes
On that sense, the difference help to compliment.
The talk, the talk about homosexuality is very controvercial.
mhm
But in one specific moment, is not a, oh lets go, like tolerancy of phenomenon of the homosexuality should be something, that,that in which need to be very well informed, no, I personally for example was not thinking that....
No
hm,so homosexuals, or lesbians and, I`m very informed and then for that, always I don't know why. From what I`m, from when I was a girl so.....
so yes.
yes
They should have the right to marry, to live with anybody.
Well yes, but in this case, accepting differences seems to be related to humanity, eh?
mm
Like it's a paradox not to be able to accept that they think differently, but, aha
What happens is this: it's that in this country that when children are in, those types of families, the Christian families that, are right-wing, let's say that those children are raised in a way that, that starting from birth they are taught that they need to be like this, and this, and this, therefore,
When they are older and meet people that are different then they say "it's not like that, because they taught me that this, and this, and this, and you have to be..."
For example, I was lucky to travel a lot and meet people from many races, from many cultures, therefore I am, well, open to everything.
And that is why when I see a person who is not, I immediately recognize it, just with one glance I say, this person is not going to accept me because I am not like her, I am not, I do not think the same, I do not look the same.
the message is very clear it has been five years since goverment, and Bill Clinton has been in Government well he was not as he was more open of course he was left more open another person.
Saying how things are done in the country and that is why there is so much controversy, with marriage there are also with the supreme court with,with the judges that want to be right also and that they are religious well, yes
be or catholics or whatever they also want that. they take abortion rights and things then so it is it is ridiculus at this point in century.
But this is why we are now.
yeah and you have? do you practice a particular religion?
Me in my family we are.In Spain I'am ca-catholism lets say soon as you are born they baptize you.first communion and all that, well got married in church.
Yes but they do not have economic power that is the problem
mhm
Hi, good evening.

And you?
Well, for me, too, of course and I work, my jo-, I am an administrator and so eh, my job for me the computer, so
The most essential, and mainly in the new techniques, right? the new technology that has arrived and every day new things come out, right?
yes.
So, the truth is I have adapted very well and have been fascinated since I have been using the computer, well before they used this writing machine, that was so slow to
write documents and forms, and all, now everything is done in the computer and the internet, right? it's something fascinating.
for me, it's essential
moving day after day, right
mm, of course, I think that they have, they have made more advances in computing than they have done with medicine.
You're right.
right, yes and for everything, right? that is it's everything that one
yes
wants he finds it there and so when one sits well, I use it for work, but also when I'm home and when I need
some information, but I sit down in the computer and there is not one to stop me, I don't know, it's like something, something essential and part of ones lifestyle, right?
yes, exactly.
For everything, because if you need to know how the temperature is outside, well you go to the computer.
News, sports.
Ah, going out with women, everything
yes yes yes
No, and even this survey we're filling right now, I found it through the computer too
Oh, that too, yes, oh
yes, hmm, then the computer has a lot of influence
yes, right. And how many calls have you made already?
in our lives. 22, this is sh- eh, 22 calls
But, but, who knows?
Yes, yes
Because I spoke in Spanish, then I think they'll accept it
Hmm, yes
Because if you speak in English, no, they won't accept it
But, the payment is made after you finish the 25 calls, right?
if you make a, a call to replace another
yes, oh, yes, yeah
I spoke to him, I know this thing's owner

because it's doing connections via the telephone
yeah, yeah, oh, and the other one was the same, twenty-five calls?
and that is technology. Yes. Something like that, it was the same thing, but it was in English
yea, and you got paid also, the same?
and paid the same.
To speak Spanish
Of course.
Mmm yeah.
Oh, yeah, I see.
Yeah.
And what kind of technology do you use? What we are doing now is technology.
What we are doing now couldn't have been done twenty or thirty years a go.
Because they are using multiple lines at the same time to connect people that live in different parts of the country.
I think that the phone technology has help in the way that I can make long distance calls and I don't have to pay anything cause you pay
ah, yeah a monthly cost
yes.
Oh, but here in
And that wasn't-, that wasn't what it was like five, ten, twenty years ago

Here in the United States, yes.
and they gave it to and meanwhile they charged me.
yes. Sure.
And you know what? Some day they are also going to make international to you favorite country.
Yeah, okay.
How good would that be, right? yeah, that would be excellent for calling to the country whenever you wanted I think that if you're going to arrive, because with one of those cards also, right? Every day
before it was really expensive. You remember how it was? To call to the country
And now it's cheaper, right?
Right now it's incredibly cheap, sure.
And why is it so cheap? Because of the technology.
That, sure, yes, well yes.
yes, technology.
Now you can talk for three, four or five hours for five dollars.
Before it was a minute, oh my God it was like eight
A minute was twenty cents, yes.
and I had to be very careful and have the clock right in front of me, no?
yes, yes, yes, I that has happened to me too
yes, aha
that yes, yes, yes, ah, I know that, what it is, you must have the clock
Aha, sure, ah, yes.
yes, but eh, with, with
yes, I've had, the truth is that, I hope that technology keeps advancing, I would say that in ten years time, what else will they come up with, no?
Because all that must keep on advancing, no?
What happens is that it's advancing and and technology is already in the hands of, of more people
Mhm. Mhm.
then services are cheaper, because they sell to more people
Na- sure, yes
do you get me?
mhmm
for example, the computer, the computer five years ago was worth two or three thousand dollars
exactly, yeah
today you can buy a computer for two or three hundred dollars
oh, yeah, that's true.
since there's more demand
Now sure, sure, yes.
they have to find cures for like cancer, if you can go to the moon, why can't they find a cure for cancer? I'm sure they can, if they can make
that's true
a super fast computer that can think, why can't they find a cure for cancer?
hmmm
I want to sice more advancement in deseases, I think they're going too slow in that matter.
hmmm, yeah
I haven't seen much advancement in diseases in the last ten, twenty, thirty, forty years.

It's  true, because how long has cancer been around?
yes, and how many people it kills, ¿right?
and they can't find a cure for it, ¿right?, and they cand find it, ¿right?
¿Right?, and that shortens life for a lot of people.
Uh, yes, yes, yes.
Or, or the heart illness too.
Uh um. AIDS, it's now spreading everywhere
AIDS is more advanced that cancer in, in,
Well, that's true.
in the way of being controlled, because now they have drugs to control it.
But cancer is going very slow, i think.
¿Have you heard about a discovery of cancer?
No, no, no, no, it's true.
I haven't, nothing.
Very slow.
They could improve on that.
yes.
I wish, no? I wish that something comes out, that that God enlightens us, so that when they find something that can eh, heal, for this catastrophe that is when cancer comes, it doesn't matter at what age, but it comes, no?
yes, yes.
That shows up in any person.
I, I had a friend that died young, she was thirty two years old and she got cancer from one day to the next
yes, aha

Oh my God, in three days? Oh.
And, and she died immediately, she had luki- leukemia, of, of the blood
