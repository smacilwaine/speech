I don't like her .  I say to her that we all are created like God .  And we start the fight .  Then I say ,  Look ,  I want peace ,  why do all this happens ?  ,  why don't we talk about

yes ,  it's difficult to explain ,  you are not .  . how do they say .  .  ? 
what ? 
Because anyways if one says to not turn around ,  you shouldn't see that then like to an adolescent or to a child ,  it will begin to sink in ,  and but why doesn't my mom let me ? 
society ,  parents ,  families ,  they have a lot of the work in helping children to understand those things ,  right ?  ,  My kid ,  when she
if he does that if he has sex with a girl there can be lots of consequences that ,  that he can hav  ,  that can happen ,  you know ? 
uh ,  I don't know if you have had the opportunity to listen to it before ? 
I wanted to say ,  that ,  they use it to say a lot of crazy things ,  right ? 
And you try to say that to someone ,  "Look ,  this is how it is ,  this ,  and this ,  didn't you realize ? " Then they say no to you ,  because you were
in a susprisingly big way ,  the people can not take it anymore ,  but they don't protest ,  and I say My G d but ,  What happens with the people ?  so .  . 
Right ,  right ,  and fi  ,  and here ,  what you do  ? 
Twelve  ?

whats up ?  ,  fabiola ?  ,  how are you ?  mm
No ,  no .  why ?  you know people there ? 
and twelve imagine and and for real we have had well , two critical moments ,  at the point of separation .  and there came a time that maturity set in .  it plays an important role No ? 
No ?   They just respect each other ,  and , 
Sure .   Sure .  Your husband is Chilean as well ? 
That's good ,  and where originally ? 
Really ? 
And how long have you lived here ? 
And have you been in this thing long ?  Of calling by telephone ? 
hello ? 
in Idaho Falls
OK , 
En ,  I go to a bigger city then . 
There in a bigger city but
Of course . 
Ah . 
Here there is not art like there are machines
Yes ,  all ready
There is Mexican art and because it's more of a rural area
Mhm
They hire Mexican artists to do work in
Ah . 
Clearly ,  yes ,  yes
Besides latinos ,  it is said that there are Mexicans
Clearly ,  the wheat
So you have to walk saying no no no
No
I am not Mexican
Clearly ,  or what I like is that they believe that I am Palestinian or an aquatic thing ,  yes .  If I go into some restaurants
Yes
Yes ,  like food from the Middle East they tell me
Eh . 
and they try to speak to me in Arabic ,  I don't know .   They think I look more like an Indian or something hes but of course ,  is there discrimination or not ? 
oh ,  but
I mean yes ,  like in this area . 
ah ,  of course . 
English well and then they have to go no but the same people ,  you know like everywhere ,  they are kind of
yes .  Yes .   Of course . 
Ah ,  but things like heavy ,  yes . 
yes ,  still
Oh ,  mm
and that weird things but is is well well far what is the city meaning
Eh . 
Oh I married a gringo
ah right ,  Idaho
yes ,  I got married to a gringo ,  I got here that way ,  and you ? 
well ,  my mom married a gringo
yes . then that is why we came went to Seattle in ninety one ,  I was elen years then . 
Mn . 
but my dad stayed in Chile and because that I go and fly like this . 
Sure . 
And to
okay
interesting . 
One like that ,  I am like we live together . 
yes because I am within the city ,  it is more city maybe .  I am from city or from the field .  for example I lived in San Rafael do not know if you place yourself but
Oh . 
yes . 
hmm ,  I don't know ,  what bothers me is
Ah
then
Oh ,  okay
yes
It's not like
but
coming here is a super drastic change for me
yes ,  I can imagine
because as I was used to living in the city ,  and here ,  but anyways ,  there's a city here where I could find what I need ,  but life is
is calmer ,  If I may put it that way
Sure
calmer and everything ,  it's good ,  though ,  because ,  for example ,  there's not as much crime as in a bigger city
Sure
but it's kind of boring
yes ,  I can imagine
kind of
The contact is difficult too
Here .  Yes ,  but not so much .  Not so much .  Even if it's small ,  it's not so big
listen ,  do not we talked the other day with .  . 
yes ,  nice to met you
yes
mhm ,  I am cover trough my husband . 
uh uhm
and children are also covered ,  so we are o . k . 
Oh , yes we are .  we are not . 
mhm ,  we are healthy ,  but you never know . 
community people ? 
yes
And so the papers they asked for with the my home and proof of work .  And ,  they finally found a pretext to to not ,  not give it to me because they asked me
hmm . 
Ah . 
uh ,  no .  No ,  no .  They didn't want to describe me .  True .  Then in the cases with him ,  he got ill once ,  yes .  He got worse . 
the cost of ,  the cost of everything ,  depends on the demand .  And so if those costs go up ,  and up ,  and up
yes .  yes . 
well ,  nurses are really well paid because there are not so many ,  you know
Then ,  Well here ,  you can see a 30 year old woman with a really nice car
Mmm
And she is a nurse ,  when you find out that she is a nurse ,  well
Yes ,  like 30 dollars per hour
yes ,  that's similar of what they get paid .  I understand that in Canada they have many medical
Then any resident in Canada has the right to medical services .  Just for been there and it really  doesn't have greater consecuences upon the economy . 
yes ,  like in Argentina ,  my parents have all the medical expenses paid
Uh uh
all the medical expenses paid ,  they pay a little ,  no ,  but very little
yes ,  yes ,  yes .  That is the other thing that one could do ,  to try to pay something
yes
is going to have some kind of insurance but even that is
is ,  is very expensive
in all the world .  In all the world
There is more competition about prescription drugs there . 
Eh ,  and then ,  last year we went to Argentina ,  went to the chemist and showed it and something which costed here more than fifty dollars
I bought there for twelve
yes ,  yes ,  yes
Twelve dollars ,  same brand and all . 
The same ,  yes . 
And in Mexico's case ,  for example ,  the medication of my son comes in 5 or 6 brands . 
with similar ingredients . 
No  ?  yes yes ,  And here you don't have more than one .  And second ,  that literature is not the best .  And if you hear only about laboratories ,  I thought that all the North American laboratories for 
I truly do ,  I really do . 
That is that ,  according to it if so
But
yes
Because don't they get you in contact with an organization that's called the Shriners  ? 
Uh uh ,  yes . 
Shriners yes . 
Eh ,  because they help children . 
Mm
Now I don't know if they specialize on a specific illness .   Or if the cover everything because maybe
you can communicate with them and tell them ,  hey we have this boy and this is his condition and this is our situation . 
And maybe they can help in some way .   Because the Shriners help and pay for medical care of children .   Who cannot pay . 
parents cannot pay . 
Ah .   See that ,  I knew him and I thought it was for me .   And I was smaller without being tired and like that only
Mm .   I am going to crash . 
maybe they ,  maybe they have more what do I know ,  something that can help you in a
yes ,  yes it is simple because really well on the one hand the maintenance is a medication that this person who helped me with the sample says no man that
Here they treat us well ,  no problem .  As soon as you see a community center or such and
Mm
there are  a lot of options .  But knowing a little more about progress of medicine ,  we believe a deeper diagnostic could improve the life of our son with
with epilepsy ? 
Right
because it was under control but the last two years it have come apart .  It has been out of control . 
how bad , 
Yes ,  you know ,  you have to keep trying
And you should be living in a state of anxiety
yes ,  sometimes it's like this
and this is a lot of stress
Always
a lot of stress
you have to look up all the time
mmm ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
When you know it you are always expecting it don't finally  happen .  But this is a traumatic for my soon ,  he is an adolescent
It happens to him in school and then he feels very bad
Seventeen . 
system of uhm
The doctors .   The medical centers where there are medical schools . 
Hmm .  yes
reasonable .   Something that you can well could uhm ,  do .   sometimes they don't charge you anything
MM
what month ,  and that ,  that's interesting ,  i had to get a test done ,  i have ADD
uh uh
And i was sure years ago i had it ,  then i just got diagnosed ,  i went to the hospital ,  the one in the university of north Carolina
uh uh
And they did not charge me anything and they did all the tests . 
yes . 
Oh ,  but what a thing . 
the topic is about technical equipment ,  like ,  the technology ,  the one you most use and depend on and yes ,  how do you consider that dependency
it's the same as ,  as i was thinking ,  exactly that ,  they should include it ,  no  ? 
yes because is ,  you know ,  a machine
yes ,  the most evident is the computer then ,  but ,  not the only one
ah
yes ,  and that's why ,  the same thing applies when you buy a car and you always use it and you have to maintain it ,  you always do ,  is part of your life
yes ,  yes ,  exactly ,  besides I am here in Texas
ah
I feel that the car culture here is like ,  a culture reminicent of the horses also
yes
in our lives ,  they take care of them here ,  is as important as the ,  come on ,  as the horses at that time
yes
For some years ago ,  and well ,  so if they not say ,  so in our time of comunication ,  most important devices are those that have to do with communication ,  computer
eh ,  as permitted the information management and all that thing ,  no ? 
yes ,  because ,  in Texas there yes ,  but only there
but
you need the car ,  you know ?  ,  to work
yes
so
exactly and here the working people have like as in those days ,  a mule .  no ?  ,  they need one ,  a pick up ,  truck pick
uh
of the most important
yes ,  but ,  ,  the questions about the topic where which ones
well ,  for me it would be more my computer and my cell phone
aha ,  exactly
aha
aha
in before ,  I did not have a cell phone until I was about twenty years old ,  but now that to ,  that live in Philadelphia in the city and that I am not always at the house fo 
I'm not always returning to the house for ,  you know ?   see my messages
yes ,  yes
well I am always ,  always ,  I always have my cell phone
you have your cell phone
I think that it is very is like surprising that almost everybody has a cell phone ,  here in the United States
yes
yes
the computer was the most important
but now
but now ,  with the kind of work that I'm doing the car is the most important .  The computer because the car is what lets you re  th  the kind of work that I'm doing is more
but well it is good for the kind of work
much more space
yes ,  yes
that in the ,  in the city having a car can be an inconvenience ,  too . 
Yeah ,  yes it is . 
because you always have to try to park and you have to pay a lot to park and the gas station isn't close and ,  I don't know ,  it's
It's better to have a car ,  a  I think . 
Yeah ,  uh ,  yeah ,  no ,  well ,  here ,  because the distances that you have to cover for work ,  the car is fundamental . 
Aha ,  of course . 
But yeah in ,  in the city I think that yeah ,  the most impor  and depending on the work too ,  well ,  uh ,  it could be the computer ,  right ?  Then
Aha . 
And that ,  uh ,  and the other question is if you consider that those technologies turn into more of a problem than ,  than in
aha
no  ?  ,  here in Texas we dont't ,  especially where i am ,  have that problem with the parking ,  lots of open spaces ,  didn't come up
we say ,  those problems over here ,  but anyway ,  don't know ,  what do you think ,  more than anything i would say ,  related to cars ,  there isn't any overall big issue with them at least
we could consider an issue the interest created around car industry and how they usually seem to affect the development of the technology of
yes
ah ,  and if we look 75 years in the past there wasn't even a bus ,  but today almost all people have it
yes yes ,  but ,  yes
and the same thing with pc's they have ,  machines that would not see the market at least for 10 years because
for
the are very advanced and they will
yes
charge their costs ,  do you get me  ?  ,  i don't think i explain very good
100 km with only 1 liter of gasoline
aha
yes
that no ,  a lot of them say that they're not affordable that in reality it's only a matter of image that companies manage and when it's time to see the tables of ,  of performance
of the hybrid cars well I thought they would be much more efficient I think that what they have accomplished on efficiency is minimal
yes
yes ,  that was an important change
ah
one ,  to ,  according to the tables an economical car drives you it can be thirty six miles per gallon
uh huh
and a hybrid can drive you fifty
ah no ,  ah yes sure ,  sure that ,  there are cars there now like the ,  the Ford
uh ,  well
uh huh
but ,  but the expedition and those enormous cars and that they spend ,  you know ?  can only go like twenty miles ,  eighteen miles per gallon something like that ,  that is an enormous expense
by ,  small cars ,  new ones that aren't in the North American market ,  that are in the European or Latin American market where they have to be much more efficient
ah ,  yes
n  it turns out to be much more expensive to have a car at what is the initial cost and for what is going to be saved in gasoline ,  ends
and ,  why is it that
European
yes ,  it's ,  yes
over there in other countries they all have small cars that well ,  different ,  different culture ,  you know ?  but
yes I ,  as a matter of fact ,  years ago that was the problem with oil ,  in the eighties or something like that ,  I don't remember
ah ,  uh huh
I thought that there was going to be a change in the culture ,  because they started to ,  to develop smaller cars here in the United States . 
yes ,  but
I am Ana Maria . 
Oh Faviola ,  Hi . 
Hi Faviola
Very good ,  with some sun or with some coldness . 
Some sun and some coldness ,  ah . 
Cold
Yes
Me too ,  I have gotten this topic before . 
No i haven't gotten this topic and I had to talk about eh ,  specifically the person when I got talked to me about violence . 
mhm
that they did not like the idea of going to see a movie .  I told them ,  a world that is a world has violence . 
mhm
They have always had ,  and I have the experience to teach the kids with pure peace and love in the television or ,  or of the world and then when they confront the world realize that it's the school . 
They find that ,  the kids hit him ,  that they didn't know how to defend above all things when you have kids of your own . 
aja
then uhm ,  I find that I was right in the classification they have ,  I think it's the responsibility of the adults ,  until when the kids can see television
I am in agreement ,  that the respons the maximum responsibility is of the parents . 
They're doing their job those on the movies ,  and
They're gaining their cash ,  what's their job , 
it's their business ,  you
doing their business ,  yeah
yeah now if you want it ,  take it ,  if you want to see it ,  or not is not their responsibility anymore ,  they se
of ,  yeah
that sells
yeah
and that's what they do ,  it's not their fault ,  the buyer is at fault
yes ,  because in the end he likes the product ,  that's why
yes
with you it's final responsibility ,  whether it's violence ,  sex ,  whatever there is to protect a ,  a child .  the final responsibility it's for the parents ,  even with a qualification system in place . 
because if there's for example a movie qualified as PG 13
yes
and you have a minor of that age and you let him see the movie ,  it's your responsibility . 
yes
exactly
entonces why me the ,  the ,  the association ,  or ,  or ,  or whatever that puts the ,  uh that puts the qualifications already has it ,  then
i think yeah ,  look we think more or less the same on that Faviola because ,  in the end the responsibility of nurtering and taking care and what you want him to see and what not
your children or your family .  and ,  your mother or your husband as a mother . 
mmm I also believed that I am totally agree and that ,  normally have access to children when parents are televicion outside . 

accurate
exact
children are alone . 
mmm
and there is not enseÃ±arlle or the pope to tell you ,  this should not see this ,  if you see
or go to a sleepover you do not know either
not clear because you have no idea
if you go to a sleepover and they put a movie ,  watch a movie or no control in that house or whatever . 
not know . 
exactly . 
I think the important thing is to give children one respect these ,  indicates whether a given good principles at home .  one as a family or teaches ,  things
shure
actually I do not like or do not like it .  you see it or not prepared ,  or just going to get far . 
that ,  because ,  as they say ,  you can not have in a glass box . 
not ,  and also
leaves ,  exposed or exposed
if not ,  moreover ,  that when children reach an age .  my son was fifteen ,  sixteen seventeen years ,  and I said do not worry ,  because you did the best I could do . 
mmm
ah ,  you descend from twenty five genes and the rest is education and decision ,  my decision in my life . 
Look ,  with that
Sure ,  I learned then ,  oh wait ,  no ,  eh ,  oh ,  I was
mm
My cellphone was ringing .  Okay ,  okay ,  let me answer . 
okay
eh ,  don't hang up because we have to speak for twelve minutes . 
yes
I'm just going to go turn it off . 
okay ah
So ,  about the people ,  I think the movies that I love to watch are the horror movies . 
I see
But sometimes ,  the ones that are scary to me ,  I'm an adult . 
You get scared ,  you get scared
they are scary but I'm going to find out the horror movies . 
I see ,  but you are responsible for watching them ,  you scare yourself
yes
I see ,  well I don't like them so I don't watch them ,  I don't watch any of them .  That's my decision ,  I could since I have the age to watch them ,  but if it's too violent I don't watch them . 
yes ,  that's why ,  that's why I respect the fact that my son said ones ,  that it's a fifty percent responsibility
Yes
of each person ,  the person and then you did the best you could ,  but then kids grow up and before they are eighteen years old ,  the
some are more mature than the norm
yes
And begin to see the R movies
mmh
at fourteen or fifteen and the PG thirteen are been seen by eleven or twelve years old kids . 
yeah ,  yes
and sometimes even the littlest ones .  Sometimes the littlest ones because I remember of a friend of Jenny that watched them ,  she sees Harry Potter and is
yes ,  thirteen yes
PG thriteen ,  PG fourteen and then I say ,  Jenny doesnÂ´t like it ,  she gets scared . 
Yeah
She gets scared by the monsters and all that stuff
yes
But I agree that most of it is the criteria that you give to them ,  and at the end take care of them if you donÂ´t want them to watch television when they are alone
yes because ,  because
DonÂ´t let them alone with the TV . 
But think that you cannot control them . 
But it is just television
You should have a formed criteria to go and see a movie . 
yes that is why I say it doesnÂ´t have a purpose to say ,  you cannot see that ,  not .  Because there will be a time when they go to a friendÂ´s house
uh huh ,  in the same school it shows movies to them . 
Oh the same school ,  but the same school is a little more supervised because that is another thing .  Because it goes ,  it goes with a purpose . 
They show him documentaries . 
But what I fear more is when he goes to friends' house .  And they have sometimes the television right there in the room ,  that they use it so much ,  or the computer or whatever . 
And they have access to information without the parents ,  no ,  nor the parents have any idea .  And they are in the room the parents think that they are listening to music or whatever
faces that situation he has to learn to value ,  and to learn to respond to that ,  That is what I say ,  or rather trying ,  trying to give them the values of the house . 
me ,  of course ,  because you know that they are still not prepared . 
uh huh
eh ,  you read the rules that there are in this ,  telephone game
yes Okay
yes ,  yes ,  yes now I am preparing now I am buying the gifts for the family .  But now I am with all ,  with other things in mind . 
the coming birthday no . 
yes but ,  I am preparing ,  buying presents for the family at least my nephews .  I have those ready ,  now we have bought the presents ,  then the big people remain no more . 
cook and sew .  Sew that which you did ,  that which you gave to me . 
Oh ,  because you are
Because I have no time before then . 
yes ,  so that's what I'm going to do also .  That's why I'm going to make some gifts ,  but for example ,  Andreita who's birthday is soon . 
yes is the twenty fifth or twenty four ,  I don't remember . 
Three days then from the twenty four .  So ,  I have her gift ,  I bought her the same thing I bought Miranda ,  So ,  eh
For the ,  one of those screens that you draw and then you erase . 
But in the meantime the pencil and screen yes . 
how exciting . 
And do you know who else has a birthday . 
OK who
The same date
that I remember when I was there
My father in law ,  that
Your father in law ,  yes
he ,  he ,  Juan Luis Sandra's youngest son . 
Oh yes OK
Also the twenty  the twenty ninth .   Also I remember ,  that about the same date ,  I remember that they were all on the same date . 
No ,  you went to Carlistos' birthday .   And ,  the girl's . 
No you went once you went to Chile and left the gift ,  which was for the birthday , 
Eh ,  it was in April ,  well ,  when I went to Chile it was in April . 
and I left there the ,  yes ,  I left the present there
yes ,  for a nephew of hers that came after . 
No ,  but Sandra will not have birthday ,  she will not have a party this year . 
And to have a more special present
Of course ,  to have a preset more , 
Juan ,  Juan is the oldest or the youngest
The youngest of all . 
Poor him . 
Carolina
Tamara
yes ,  and you ? 
I'm in the state of Washington ,  in Seattle
wow ,  I'm in Los Angeles
Ah ,  yes
yes ,  it's amazing ,  just
yes
Right now I was making a call and suddenly I ,  I mean I didn't think that today Sunday  I was half  more asleep than awake ,  and I ,  Oh my God . 
yes ,  this is ,  I think ,  my 23th call
wow ,  you're almost ready ,  I'm right in the middle ,  this is my 10th
yes ,  and this is the second time I do this service for them
Oh ,  okay ,  okay ,  yes ,  because casually I got a mail that they will accept people who'll do again the ,  eh ,  participate ,  because at first you could participate only once
yes
yes ,  I
More like ,  yeah ,  tell me
little conventional
OK
we started at the theater ,  for example in the case of theater ,  no ,  the same one as in tv .   Now we watch documentary type movies .  .  . hum .  .  . with different kind of messages then
No ,  no ,  no ,  and really suddenly we started to receive information about other kinds of movies and well we switched completely to that .  furthermore right now we are in one
in one of those kicks ,  that we are even kind of intellectual now but it is that ,  it is because actually it kind of got to that point ,  where you feel that , 
a very different content ,  that it is worth watching them but in the end I have felt that they are making movies ,  like just for making them
aha exactly . 
I am from Panama
Ah ,  OK I am from Venezuela . 
Oh OK
Right ,  yes
in ,  then it is true ,  is true
We say in that way to the "Macha" no ,  like well ,  yes do movies like you want but yes released some good released and others ,  if they don't be released don't be released but
Honestly not .  And the same is happening with the TV right now .  We had cable and now just a matter of a month ago we canceled it because not ,  no I don't know suddenly as
when we went out you knew that he was an American . 
exactly
and the next day ,  same happened and I said ,  "oh ,  ex agent .  I believe they were showing stuff that happened last week and overreacting
Exactly
Because it's not true ,  and that
You see ,  coincidentally they showed a picture called The .  .  .  It was something like "Defending Panama"
I think it was called "Los de Richos" the Chinese sector that practically the whole town disappeared and I
oh from "Churillo"
ah Del Chorrillo ,  exactly
Yes that's where it was ,  the part of the police force was there
Yes .  But just like you say it seems that happens the same way in Venezuela with the current President .  There are things happening that you know aren't actually happening
from Univision .  Telling them not to be so shameless ,  asking them to not report things that aren't true ,  people first say hey .  that President
that's right
and well ,  I don't know if you've heard him
No ,  no cause like i was saying I don't really pay attention to the news , 
Of course ,  look ,  there's an internet page were you can watch TV from all countries including of course Panama its called
Te ve Cuatro ,  like TV four all
 TV
four all
Yes ,  theater . 
But I specifically watch the government chanel ,  the national chanel .  Because the other channels belong to the opposition ,  then of course it is a litle bit more of the same
of the whole world a little like to compare you see ,  that is what is going on and even what we are doing as well with the radion we are listening to community ,  radio that you feel that it i  you
you are really saying the truth or at least the other face of the coin let's not say that it is the truth One hundred per Cent because sometimes it is not
that is it is not that I don't know ,  but that one can not say either that all of the ones that say the other it is not but
aha
darn they really do manipulate things too much . 
you got one  I don't know if you saw here a movie that was called Auto fox
No ,  maybe but I do not recall
That is a documentary that they worked at Fox New
hmm
and well practically they would force them to say what was not true and then they decided to resign to the channel and aside from resigning all of them got together and started to do like a protest to a level
well on the level of ,  of ehm locally to tell the world what was going on over there inside Fox News .   It is very interesting ,  it was called something like
Hello Fernanda ,  How are you ?  My name is Claudia . 
Where are you talking ?  .  Well .  Where are you talking from ? 
from Washington
Washington ,  DC
ah ,  yes because ,  then ,  I think there are two ,  or not ? 
yes ,  Washington State
ah ,  I see and the other one
yes ,  IÂ´m here in Idaho State ,  I donÂ´t know if you know it . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes of course yes
yes , but that thing about the movies ,  the fact is than in my point of view ,  I donÂ´t agree with them because after all
they donÂ´t classify them very well .  Ah ,  for example ,  sometimes they say is PG and later you see that movie and it really
has many dirty words and porn .  Sometimes another one PG thirteen is more quiet
and doesnÂ´t have such many things like nudity and dirty words .  The true is that to me ,  those classifications sometimes are like they donÂ´t
yes ,  the true is that I donÂ´t know to much about movies because
aha
let's say ,  I don't have children or anything like that ,  so I almost never realize
aha
what ,  what classification . 
yes
yes
now many things are like normal that that I think shouldn't be . 
yes ,  yes it's true because ,  eh ,  and it's true because eh ,  once ,  well I don't have cable I have ,  the regular channels ,  the ones you watch
aha
to keep on choosing my program that I'm going to watch in that ra  at that time
mhm
and sometimes the show movies that really ,  uf .  A ten year old or a nine year old kid was at home and he was watching that ,  he was changing channels at the same time as I was and
he stopped on that channel ,  there things that were very ,  very much for adults . 
sure and
imagine ,  what kind of cartoons are they going to watch them ,  I remember that I was once watching the television ,  you see ,  in Mexico ,  I'm from Mexico City
mhm
It was around ten in the evening ,  ten PM .  So ,  I turned on the TV ,  I had cable there ,  the cable TV
what's that . 
she turned the television off and she had to explain it to me because she was surprised ,  I mean ,  shocked because I was watching a regular cartoon channel . 
and that could happen to any child watching television . 
And you can't be with your kid all the time ,  you can't jump and try to see what he's watching ,  you have to trust that ,  at least during the day
yes
the shows are not going to include nudity or bad words . 
eh ,  tr  in Cablevision and Multivision ,  that would be the same as cable here so  ah ,  over there in Mexico ,  they don't have as many restrictions .  For example ,  in regular television ,  with regular channels
they have like more ,  more restrictions .  Eh not so much in the other cables and ,  for example ,  in ,  in teles ,  for example ,  a regular ch  channel for kids
in the District of Mexico ,  mhm
before ,  in Mexico .  But for example ,  if you are watching a cable channel you run the risk that the cartoon may be something that sometimes is some
aha
aja
what's more ,  here when it's not e  even ten or at any other time you run the risk of seeing anything
yes ,  yes ,  it's true lo  the other ,  well eh ,  I was with a neighbor ,  imagine I was with a neighbor ,  it was twelve ,  twelve thirty in the afternoon . 
Well ,  there was a show there was ,  where there was a ,  a girl that had adventures of a girl that was that ,  that in a hospital
and suddenly it happened right there in the hospital and they were showing how ,  how her mom was giving birth to her little brother . 
Yeah ,  but you can tell i took and told him at her mother and she said ah , no there is no problem is a channel of
of of cartoons , of , of that they play programs and sincerely i was i was they did not leave much to the imagination .  it was really a pose of well it was an operating room where the lady was having a baby . 
what they want .  but sinceraly a m do not want to explain to my kids too much for the moment , sincerly I watch more what they see , 
yes ,  imagine when lets say there are babysitters and things like that that have no center and you are not even home to see . 
yes no
I think
yes is of those ,  really those rating they pass Yn yn n y primary for the televison ,  the truth already already n 
they do not leave a thing to imagination , they show you . 
yes
Now at whatever , whatever time of the day you see one of those telenovelas ,  I do not like to watch telenovelas but , see
Many mo mon is home and has young children three , four years five or more they are at home and they see they are watching their telenovela
And always est they show scenes were they are the  ,  a couple they are there having relations
Mhm
During the day ,  why do they put on so operas ,  from six am until it gets dark . 
Not ,  me
then ,  the programs are classified ,  so it would be normal to see a pornographic on TV in the middle of day . 
exactly
And i think that if the parents talked to that TV station and told them to put away unacceptable programs ,  or to put privacy on some scenes ,  from those kind of scenes . 
they don't care ,  mhm
what are they teaching them .  I don't like those classification things ,  and the producers dont really care ,  i think its only convenient to them ,  because , 
Or sometimes it even gets their attention because there's a strong scene ,  so those things actually help the , 
producers to sell . 
yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah
Even though ,  I'm already tired of them ,  but still like them ,  I have a Disney movie here ,  but i honestly just don't like movies . 
sure ,  sure
Yes ,  one does not know how they will change
No ,  no ,  so then already ,  the truth is that ,  this is truly reaching too far already ,  you turn the TV on and see a tv spot
about women pads and it appears well until almost ,  they are going to explain how ,  soon they will display a naked movie and are going to
show there how she is placing the pad on
exactly
Because sometimes they even draw it for you .  I do not know if you have seen such commercials that uf .  They do not scare you because you are already grown up Â¿right ?  but
if a little boy or girl is watching them and you say ,  it the mom is there and can answer all is right ,  and if it is the friend who is there
and she or he answers ,  he/she can explain him/her the wrong info so , 
then ,  yes
like I sometimes see and one does not realize how things have changed . 
Good night my name is Mariza de Philadelphia
Hello Hello my name is Juan are you Marisol . 
Mariza .  Mariza . 
Could be ,  I am in San Antonio ,  Texas . 
OK well the subject today is ,  the issue with religion ,  right . 
Well Exactly ,  like the need of religion is something ,  something we all have ,  I suppose . 
Ahh ,  yes in reality every nowadays in this country .  Eh ,  in the United States there is also a lot ,  a lot of problems with religion ,  that is mixed of with politics and a lot of right wing people that are the ones that want to have control . 
Otherwise ,  Christianity is the most powerful religion in the world and they are the ones who most ,  who have more control to have an influence to politics ,  to countries . 
mhm
What ,  they represented a whole project ,  ideology ,  but plain and simple ,  they are the most conservative groups in the United States ,  right . 
yes
In the sermon ,  above all it very much called my attention against the public school . 
Because yes , 
ah ,  ah ,  no
And against the theory ,  of that they try to see the theory of evolution ,  no . 
So ,  that's what I had heard ,  yes . 
Exactly ,  yes ,  there are many problems ,  yes . 
No ,  each one can believe whatever they want ,  what happens is that they try to im  impose their belief for everyone and that the bible be ,  that they are the ones that think
Exactly ,  those are fundamentalism ,  no . 
whites from ,  eh ,  Christians and those are the ones that people with power in this country ,  the ones that own companies ,  everyone is ,  the same ,  that they are many conservative fundamentalist people from the right that want to take out the law
The right to abort ,  the right to ,  for example like another question was about homosexuality ,  gay marriage ,  the right to believe in the
yes ,  more scientific no ,  no ,  One should not only believe in what they say ,  they say God created man and woman ,  but also give the option for kids to believe , 
that it was Charles Darwin the theory of evolution .  And
yes
And is very complicated also ,  the other questions was about homosexuality ,  yes ,  yes If we were all the same or believed the same thing ,  these problems wouldn't exist ,  asked . 
yes
In that sense ,  the differences help to compliment . 
mm
But at any given moment , is like ,  like the tolerance the phenomenon of homosexuality should be something ,  that ,  that we should be well informed on ,  me personally for example I used to think before that , 
it could be regarded as a deviation ,  homosexuality ,  but lately I've read that it's also a question of genetics . 
Like I used to accept people because ,  I didn't think they were better or worse for being homosexuals and every one has a right to ,  I don't know ,  to get married ,  to
Well yes , 
to be with whoever they want .  Its' the same whether is a man or a woman ,  I don't care and I think they have the same rights because they are citizens just the same ,  and they pay their own taxes . 
Because many people think about the homosexuality like a very perverted thing and they don't have the right to get married ,  not when is a situations when actually the marriage is an agreement . 
Of course ,  but the the church disagrees . 
Maybe that was before ,  the traditional way of thinking in the past but now times are changing and each one so is ,  the same as before ,  homosexuality has always existed  ,  since the human being beginning what happen is that before was a way and right now so , 
it goes ,  I don't know things are more liberal nowadays ,  let's say people people are not afraid of say anymore ,  so I am homosexual ,  or I am gay or I am  whatever
That's the problem .  That have the church has a problem ,  but it can't do anything becaus
Of course Yes there is some that is very extreme about ,  eh ,  the family and the marriage ,  the church institute and the God blessing to the marriage and stuff when actually . 
the church and religion is a form of institution ,  it is the same as the school ,  has
Of course . 
yes
of the society and the individuals ,  no . 
Yes well ,  but in that case ,  to accept differences seems to be something that has to do with a matter of humanity ,  no . 
yes
I for example ,  had the good fortune of traveling a lot of meeting people from many races ,  many cultures ,  then I am open to everything . 
But it is that there are kinds there are people of all kinds and ,  and well there must be radical Christians there must be all kinds ,  but I believe that yes ,  it does influence the country a lot ,  the religion ,  yes
Eh ,  yes ,  it influences a lot ,  what surprises me the most in this case , 
yes
In this country ,  that it is so fundamental ,  no
Yes I they are
With the churches ,  there is a good percentage of fundamentalists even in the discurse of the very president there is fundamentalism , 
Sure ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes
not there , 
The message is pretty clear ,  it's been five years with this government and when Bill Clinton was in the government ,  well ,  he was not that ,  he was pretty open ,  let's say ,  sure ,  he was leftist ,  more open ,  a more open person . 
don't care whether they are Catholics ,  they just want that they ,  they want to eliminate the right to abortion and things like that ,  it's ridiculous ,  at this stage in the century . 
But ,  that's how we are now . 
My family is from Spain so we are Catholics ,  let's say ,  when you are born you get baptized ,  then there's the First Communion and all that ,  well I got married in the church too . 
I believe ,  well ,  i have my beliefs ,  but i not attend to the church ,  to every Sunday service ,  neither practice ,  i am ,  i believe
but let's say i do it at my own way ,  let's say that the faith i have with me ,  i don't
yes
neither ,  neither i am ,  i mean i am very open i mean it's contradictory I'm quite believer ,  i'm catholic ,  but i'm not you know ,  i'm not funda  nothing
yes It happens the same to me and when I have some closeness with the Catholic Church ,  it is almost temporal because They are so hey where is a sense of integration ,  of community in here
created interest in everyone seems
yes ,  yes ,  yes there is lot of economic interest ,  yes
no ,  then
That's the problem ,  it's at first sight that they are not interested in the church members ,  they are interested in the money ,  and
yes
And also neither they seem to be quite believers ,  there had been a lot of cases of ,  child abuses and things like that ,  of child abuses
That are often heard ,  so one ask himself how this can be possible .  That a ,  a priest do this to a child and ,  There is much controversy regarding this
yes ,  good evening . 
from los Angeles
oh well ,  I'm from new york
oh okay ,  i thought it was somebody else ,  sorry
ha
i am from los angeles , 
oh okay ,  nice to meet you
nice to meet you
well ,  we got this night ,  the technical devices . 
I'm from peru . 
oh okay , 
and you ? 
um ,  i am from colombia , 
colombian ? 
mhm
Oh ,  but you talk like a Mexican . 
Because here we speak Mexican Spanish . 
Aha
Because of that . 
Ah ,  OK ,  of course . 
Oh . 
When I lived in Colombia ,  I caught the Colombian Spanish .  From Bogota ,  especially . 
Now it is the turn of Mexican Spanish . 
Because that is what is spoken here
Aha ,  yes . 
OK ,  of course ,  aha . 
yes ,  because tonight's subject is technical gadgets . 
ah ah ,  I have the ~D ~S ~L very rapidly now . 
yes ,  and It fascinates me because I like the internet fast ,  I don't like to wait websites . 
so for me it's very useful because I look for jobs ,  I do surveys ,  look for women
Mhm
Mhm .  Ya ,  right
I like to do it fast ,  and before ,  when I was in line ,  in the phone . 
it was really slow . 
So I had to wait two or three minutes only for one webpage to appear . 
and until now ,  well I have a webcam ,  and the webcam is really fast with ~D ~S ~L
yeah ,  of course . 
it's fast . 
Mm ,  ya ,  of course . 
Well ,  for me ,  as well ,  of course and I work ,  my jo  ,  I am an administrator and so uh ,  my job I use it and for me the computer ,  I mean the
yes . 
Then ,  the truth is that I have adapted very well and I have loved it since I am using the computer ,  well um before when the typewriter was used ,  it was so slow to
for me ,  it's essential ,  I think that I wouldn't know what I could do if without the computer ,  no ?  So ,  the truth is that I am very happy with this new technology ,  and hopefully it continues
Mm ,  of course ,  I think that ,  they have ,  e  ,  they have done more a  advances on the computer than they have on ,  with medicine . 
It's true . 
The computer is the most advanced of the civilization now . 
yes . 
wants they find it there and well when one sits at the well ,  I or use it for my work ,  but ,  well also and when I am at home and I need
yes ,  exactly . 
For everything ,  because if you need to know how the temperature is outside ,  well you go to the computer . 
News ,  sports . 
Oh ,  going out with women ,  everything . 
No ,  and even in this poll that we're conducting ,  i found it on the computer too . 
Yes ,  almost mm ,  then the computer has a lot of influence
in our lives .  Twenty two ,  that's crap ,  uh ,  twenty two calls . 
I almost ,  i have to do about three ,  but o  ,  one call that the person spoke more in english ,  so i ,  i think I'm gonna have to replace it . 
Right ,  right . 
Because i spoke in spanish ,  so they should count it . 
Because if you speak in English no ,  they don't count it . 
yes ,  you do a ,  a call to replace . 
I went to talk to him ,  i know the owner of this
and ,  and I will ask him if I have to replace it
yes
Oh ,  that's good . 
yes ,  is easy ,  is easy talking to him . 
No ,  he must be in Philadelphia
Oh ,  okay
but ,  but he gave me the tele 
No ,  no ,  no ,  no , 
Oh ,  only through the computer
yes ,  I know him through the computer ,  but he
through the internet ,  okay ,  aha . 
but he ,  he talks to the people that are participating . 
yes ,  then if you have any questions you can ,  he's Chinese
Oh ,  yes ? 
yes ,  well ,  I don't know if he is the owner ,  he is
Oh
the ,  the manager
yes
yes ,  that ,  by  ,  supervisor of ,  the project they are pursuing . 
I see ,  I see ,  I see . 
No ,  I don't know it ,  but most probably yes ,  because I ,  I al  ,  I have one two already . 
One in English and the other one in Spanish
yes ,  and this what we are doing now is technology
Oh .  Oh . 
and this is techonology ,  yes ,  something like that ,  it was it was the same thing ,  but in English
And they paid the same
Oh ,  I see ,  I see . 
Yes ,  I like doing this not only for the pay ,  but it gives me opportunity . 
Mm ,  yeah . 
Oh ,  uh huh
Yes . 
You couldn't do this twenty ,  thirty years ago what we're doing now
Exactly ,  aha
because they're using multiple phone lines to connect many people who live in different part of the country . 
I believe that phone technology has made advances also because I can make long distance calls and they don't cost me anything because you pay
uh ,  a monthly fee
Aha . 
Oh ,  but here in
And that was not like th  ,  that was not like that like in five or ten ,  twenty years . 
Here in the United States ,  yes . 
yes . 
if they charged you something monthly ,  but if you make a lot of calls ,  it is worth it . 
Ay ,  how great . 
Yes ,  right . 
Now it is really cheap ,  of course . 
And why is it cheap ?  Because of technology . 
Yes that ,  of course . 
yes ,  the technology . 
Now you can speak three ,  four ,  five hours for five dollars . 
It used to be a minute back then ,  oh my god ,  it was like eight
A minute cost around twenty cents ,  yes . 
Mm . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  I have been through that too
yes ,  aha
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  I know what that's like ,  yes ,  that you are going against the clock . 
Because it's advancing and technology is now reaching more people
Mhm ,  Mhm . 
so ,  services are cheaper ,  they are selling it to more people
Na ,  sure ,  yes
Mhm ,  sure
Eh ,  for example ,  the computer ,  five years ago ,  they were around two ,  two or three thousand dollars
Exactly ,  yes . 
and now you can buy a computer for two or three hundred dollars
Ah ,  yes ,  that's true ,  aha
because there's ,  there is a lot of demand . 
Technology is advancing ,  it is advancing . 
I would love to see
yes . 
Mm . 
That's right . 
Mm .  Mm . 
I've not seen many improvements ,  in ,  in cure for illnesses in the past ,  ten ,  twenty ,  thirty ,  forty years . 
OK
It's true ,  because he already has cancer for some years
They haven't ?  And this shortens the lives of many people . 
Yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
Or ,  or heart disease too . 
Uh huh .  AIDS ,  now that it's spread through so many places
AIDS is more advanced than cancer in ,  in
Yes ,  that's right . 
In the sense of being controlled because they already have drugs to fight it . 
Uh huh ,  yeah . 
No ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  it's true . 
I see . 
Very slow . 
yes
yes yes
that occurs in anyone
I I had a friend that died young ,  at 31 years old and had cancer from one day to the next
yes ,  Already
and he died in three days
yes ,  but that day hisbrain was bleeding
oh my god
and he died immediately ,  she had leuke ,  leukemia of the blood
Oh wow
and from this ,  he had one day for another
Oh my God
mhm ,  and there was nothing they could od
Mm
not that not it
