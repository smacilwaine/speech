I wanted to say, that, so later they have said a few stupid things, no?
and you try to tell the other person, look it's like this, like this.. don't you realize?  And then they tell you no, because you are
me too, at the beginning there wasn't I didn't have access to that, to that page I said, My Good, could it be true what they are saying about Venezuela? But I talked with my friends
Of course, of course, what do you do there in Philadelphia?
Oh, and do you think it is best over there than in Miami?
Well, my name is Ibet, and you are..?
And what do you think aboout today's topic? is it easier to break with someone young or, the age makes a difference.
eh, I'm going to have 3 kids and building castles in the air and when he came once and told me, you know what? here we are over
That´s good. It´s better.What for? Trouble, to get in trouble
And you?
yes, and how does that happened to you?
that, of course, you don't fully know, right? until you get married with that person but I think that I think
Fine, and you?
And you?
NO,Why, do you know people there?
Do you work?
But, definetively they'll have that option, then. And even, eh, there are paretns that combine, the signal language with the oral part, No? depending on
As I say, if I fall down, i just put myself up, What's the problem?
Because, what will we do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre relationship. As you say, there are some people who spend up to 30 years together, and in a crappy relationship
yes?
They, they mistreat each other. Like, you piece of who knows what, like, what's that? Why would I want-?
Right? you just respect, and
you think it's easier?
what do you say? or when we're super b-
Hi, hi, how are you?
Really?
and his name?, and then came and went clear but more or less in the ninety-one , and you?
English and then they have to go around but not like other people, you know how in every place, they are average
yes. yes. Of course.
of course.
yes but.
of course for example in the rural areas of Georgia you would see things like you see the Ku Klux Klan I don't know
Oh, yes really.
Oh, mm
And those weird things but is very very far from the city I mean
Eh.
Eh.
Oh, Oh, how weird.
Oh I married a Gringo.
yes. I married a gringo, that's how I came here.  And you how, how?
yes, and so that's why we came to we went to Seattle in ninety one, I was about eleven years old
Mm.
Oh. okay
Mm. okay
And so you're single now?
Yes something like that, I am like we live together
Oh, okay
Well then sure.
okay Ah, look. And what's this called, do you like it or not?
on they way from San Felipe to the Andes that is like a question more more rural and you couldn't imagine how
Oh
typical Chilean countryside and I loved it.
It was a village, what do I know. I like to be inside the city because I know there's more going on, like you know, there are more things to do.
yes, I can Imagine
half
same in contact, is difficult also
Here, yes, same but not so much. Not so much. Like when, even, at least less mall, is not too big.
Yeah, ¿how're you doing?
Yeah, i think so, you're in Texas and I'm in North Carolina.
Oh, yeah, me too.
Uh, I'm covered through my husband.
Uh, uh.
Oh, well, look, we're. We're not.
And the, yeah. And the other day i went precisely to a, an office in which they supposedly give some kind of, i mean, pension for
people from the community, right?
Yes
And well the papers that they asked me with my address and proof of work. And, finally they found an excuse to not, not giving it to me because they asked me
Mm.
and and, in my case, I have a son with epilepsy.
And, then he needed some some emergency attention here things that
eh, no. No, no. They didn't want to give me the prescription. Right. So in the cases that press with him, he was in a bad way once, yes. He became worse.
the costs of, the cost of everything, depends on demand. And so if those costs keep on going up, up and up
The money doesn't stop being like a drug, you see.  They are already used to a certain amount of money.
And then now, suddenly they are not going to have it.
Then the interest is wors
We would stop making bombs and going to war.  Look, all that money that could be put
on schools or in a medical system, social medicine.
Mm. Yes.
yes.  Tell me, twenty, thirty dollars an hour.
yes, yes I Uh uh.  Then who in this case well it is offered.  In Canada I understand well they have much medicine, no?
No, but the difference is that they started right.
Yeah, it's like in Argentina, my parents have their full medications paid
Uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the other thing, you could at least try to pay something.
in other places around the world. Everywhere around the world.
Uh, uh
Uh, and then, uh, we went to Argentina last year, i went to the drugstore and i showed them something that was over fifty dollars here
i bought it there for twelve dollars
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Twelve dollars, the same brand and all.
with some ingredients
Mm.
Mm.
Well what do I know, apparently that things yes like that
But.
yes.
Uh uh. ah yes.
Ehm, because they help the children.
Mm.
yes.
Uh uh.  Uh uh.  Well yes look, yes
yes I knew that.  Hey, we ran out of time or what?
yes.  Maybe I am making a mistake in not finding out you see it doesn't cost anything.
And also if you call the Catholic Charities
Uh.  Uh uh. That is true.
There are lots of samples. And, but knowing a little bit more about the advances. Its because I can give out the medicine we think that one diagnostic more profound could improve the lifestyle of my son with
because It had been under control, but lately he has as close to two years that It has been disconnected. He has been out of control.
And, well, yes, they gave him another one. They leveraged him and it didn't work so by no means, he had to take it off and return to the basics.
what
yes, yes, you know, it is matter of experimenting.
well yes, sometimes yes.
all the time yes.
life without you telling me is always pending, all the time.
Hmm
It happens in school and he feels really bad.
seventeen
ah, sure, he's a teenager
Eh, yes, well, returning to the subject, I think he should try with some good
System of, eh
With the doctors. The medical centers that have medical schools
Uh
Sometimes the different departments there
yes
hmm
And we don't have that much money
Hmm, yes
And they, they make notes of what they give you. And they charge accordingly. Something that always is, uhmm
Mm.
Of month. and that, is is this interesting. I had to make myself an abscess. I it turns out that I have a thing that is called ADD
and they didn't charge me anything and they did all the exams.
yes.
I told them.
Mm. Uh uh.  Then, they told me no well you have to bring us information.  I had a letter about my income, etc., no?
They didn't want to give you that information.
Mm.
Maybe now you can
Uh uh.
Hello, how are you? my name is Juan
Hello, well eh, Mateo here
I am in San Antonio.  Mateo, I think we had already talked, you are in Philadelphia
yes, how, how have you been?
no, I didn't hear it, what is the topic?
the topic are technical gadgets, I mean technology, the gadgets you use the most and that you depend on then and if, how do you consider that dependence
it is the same that, it is the same I was thinking, clearly, they should include it, no?
yes because it is a, you know? a machine
exactly, well, but, I said well yes, the automobile seems to be the most important, no?, it is- then I thought maybe it is the computer, but no
yes, the most obvious one is the computer well, but, it is not the only
ah
but a tool like very personal seems to be the car, no?
yes, and because of that, the same thing you buy a car and you are always using it and you always have to maintain it, you always have, it is some part of your life
yes yes, exactly, besides like I am here in Texas
Okay
I believe that here the car culture is something like a reminiscence of the horses culture also
yes
to, to your life. here take care of them and the is as important as, let't say, as the horse at that time, no?
yes
Some years ago and, and well, well if don't say, so in our time of communication the most important devices are going to be the related with communication, the computer
yes, because, here in Texas yes, but even there in Texas
but
yes
so
exactly and here working people have like in that times like a mule, no? they need a a, a pick up a, truck pick up
pick up truck, right? and listen, and it does not leave them, then is, eh, it is evident, like it is a hard work culture very, very important
right
of the most most important
yes, but... the cuestions on the topic were what
well, for mi it would be more my computer and my cell phone
aham, exactly
aham
aham
back then, i didn't had a cell phone until i was like twenty, but now that a- that i live in Philadelphia in the city and that I'm not always going back home fo-
not always going back home for for, you know? seeing my messages
yes, yes
well I'm always always, always having my cellphone
having your cellphone
i think it's very it's like surprising that almost everyone has a cellphone here in the united states
yes
and well, on the computer were the messages, there was always the internet, the mails more than the phone, the cellphone, anything, right?
yes
the computer was the most important
but now
but now,with the type of work that I am doing the car is the most important .the computer because the car is what permits re-type of job that I am doing
well it is because the type of work well
LOT MORE SPACE
yes yes
for in the, in the city having a car can be an inconvenience as well.
yes, yes, that yes
because you have to try and park and have to pay to park and the gas station is not close. and I don't know es
better to have a car I think
yes eh,yes because of the distance I have to travel in my work the car is more fundamental
yeah sure
yeah
and that and eh, and the uestion is if you consider that you are eh this technology becomes more a problem then then in
right
no? here in Texas no, there isn't, where I'm from there is not  major problems, no?, with the parking there is a lot of space everywhere, he hasn't presented
Lets say, those problems here, but in the end, I don't know, I don't know what your opinion is, above everything I would say that, well, in regards with the cars, matter of cars and all that well it doesn't look like a big problem unless
we could consider a problem the interests created around the, motor industry and like so sometimes they affect the growing of technology.
right, but don't you think that, that its very awesome that it changed in about sixty years.
yes
a, yes we seen how sixty-five years ago there wasn't any cars, but nowadays everyone has it
yes,yes, yes but, yes
and the same thing with computers they have, they have computers that wont go off the market for like ten years because
well
because they have those things very advanced and the things have not cumbri- have not cum-
yes
Exactly yes, well like they say too, with the motor industry, right? if the motor industry would have advanced technologically much like the electronic industry then maybe an automobile will let us transport like
one hundred kilometers with one liter of gas.
right
yes
that no, most of them say that they are not feasible and that in reality it is only a matter of image that the companies manage and when the time comes to see the, the scoreboard
regarding hybrid automobiles well I thought that they were going to be much more efficient I think that the efficiency they have achieved is minimal
yes
yes, that was an important change
you don't think that it is an important change, or
oh
a, a,according to the rules an economy car drives you it could be thirty-six miles per gallon
aha
and a hybrid can drive you fifty
oh no, ehm yes sure, sure that, there are cares around right now like the, the Fords
oh so
OK
yes exactly  but at the same time cars like this, there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance that hybrids and they aren't hybrids no?
by small cars, news that are not in the North American market, they are in the European market or Latino American where they have to be more efficient
oh yes
it goes out more expensive have a car for the initial spend and for what you can save in gasoline finally
its less that you have a car very low cost no
and why is that
European
because the united states is one of the ony nations that have this you only have big cars here you know
yes i am yes
there in other countries  have smaller cars its good a different culture you know but
yes i just a few years ago the oil problem, in the eighties or something like that i don't remember
OK
i thought i was having an exchange of culture because they started to develope little more here in the united states
yes but
i thought well i was going to have an exchange of culture but that was nothing by the time no it seems because they have a big cars they keep like
I am Ana Maria
Oh Faviola, hi
Hi Faviola
How are you?
Very nice, sunny or cold
sunny and cold, oh
cold
yes
I also had that topic before
I did not had that topic before and I had to talk about it, specifically the person I had to talk to talked about violence
mhm
No, he liked the idea of going to see movies.  I told him, the world is the world.  It has violence
mhm
Always had, and have the experience to teach children abroad peace and love on television oh, oh in the world and later when they face the real world which is the school
You find that, little kids hit him, that they do not know how to defend themselves.  Moreover, when you have only children
OK
then oh, I find that it is good the classification they have, I believe that is the adults responsibility, until when the children can watch television
I agree, the maximum responsibility lies within the parents
The are doing their job the one who make movie and
they are earning money, what is your job,
in their business, you
doing their business, yes
yes, now the one who wants it, take it, who wants to see it, do not want to see it, is not their responsibility, they see
of, yes
that sells
yes
And is what they do, it is not their fault, is the fault of the ones who buy
yes, the one who likes the product, for that reason
yes
With you that is the most responsibility, whether is in violence, of sex, of what ever you want to protect a, a child in.  The responsibility is of the parents, even if there is a classification.
Because, if there is a movie classification, for example, PG thirteen
yes
If you have younger child and if you let him/her watch the movie is your responsibility
yes
exactly
So then, because I, the the association, or, or, or whoever places, places the classification, already have it then,
I think if, imagine, we think more or less the same in that Faviola because, at the end you realize that the responsibility or raising and take care and of what you want them to see and not see
Your children, or your family. Eh, your mother or your husband like mother
MM i think i totally agree and the other, normally the children have access to television whenever parents are not home
Exactly
children are alone
mhm
And there isn't a father there to show or teach, you can't view this, view that
And if they make a sleepover, you don't know either
Right, no you don't have a clue
If they go a sleepover and they put a movie, watch it in that house without control and whatever
You never know
Exactly
I think the important is give them one. To respect that rules and if you give them good principles at home. Your family, ans show him things
Right
Exactly that i don't like or i don't like it. You must see if you're prepared, the moment will surely come
Why, because like they say, you can't have them in a crystal box
No, and besides
yeah, exposed (boy) or exposed (girl)
yes, and when they reach a certain age. My son had around 15 years and he tells me, Don't worry you've the best you could
mhm
ah, 25% is the genes and education and the rest decision, my life decisions
Look, with that
Sure, then I learned. Oh, wait, no eh, oh, I was and
mm
My cell phone was ringing. OK, OK wait and I'll answer.
OK
Eh, don't hang up because we need to talk for twelve minutes.
yes
It, I only went to turn it off.
OK ah
And about the people, I think, on the movies I love to watch horror films.
Yeah
But sometimes that, that I'm scared, I'm a adult.
You, you scare yourself,
I get scared and I'm going to find out about horror movies.
Yes, yes, but your responsibility is to watch it, and you scare yourself
yes
Yes, I don't like them and I don't watch them, I don't watch any kind like that. That is why it's my decision bec- even if I have the age to watch it, if it's too aggressive, I don't want to watch it.
Yes, that's why, that's why I respect what my son told me that time, fifty per cent is responsibility,
yes
of, of the individual, of the person, eh, you already did the best you could, but it comes an age in boys before they are eighteen
Some are more mature than others,
yes
and they start watching rated r movies.
mm
at the age of fourteen and fifteen, and eleven and twelve year olds are watching pg 13 movies.
yeah right.
and sometimes even kids, and even younger kids, because i remember, my friend jenny had a kid that watched harry potter.
yeah thirteen yeah
PG thirteen PG fourteen, so i say, jenny doesn't like that, she gets scared.
yeah
she's scared of monsters, and all that
yeah
but i agree, that the major part is the criteria that you make of it, to take care of them if they don't want too.
yeah why, why
not just leave them with the tv.
but imagine if you cant control it.
but its only tv.
that's what i mean, you can control it, you need to be more mature, it isn't true.
we need to have criteria formed, to watch movies.
yeah that's why i said you don't get anything good out of watching it, like at his friends house.
aha, in the same school they show them movies.
Oh the same school, but the same school is a little more supervised because that's already another thing. Because they have a purpose.
They show them documentaries.
But what I fear the most is when they go to their friend's house. And they sometimes have the television right there in the room, which is so customary nowadays, or the computer or whatever.
And they have access to information without their parents, without their parents having any idea. And they are in the room their parents think that they are listening to music or whatever
Perhaps they are watching something inappropriate. That's why, I mean what happens, is that if my daughter or son or whatever it is,
faces that situation he has to learn to value himself, And learn to respond to that, That's what I say, in other words, trying to instill in him the home values.
Follow like superman the little boy that climbed on the window and got killed.
of course, because you know they are still not prepared.
aha
eh, did you read the rules that are in this, phone game.
yes Okay
yes, yes, yes I'm getting ready I'm already buying the gifts for the family. But now I have, I have other things on my mind.
is your birthday no.
Buy something for the adults, a little something, either way I'm going to make the majority of the gifts.
That's what I was going to tell you
I'm going to cook, yes ah
cook and boil. To boil that thing you made, that thing you gave me
Two days before Miranda
Andreita has her birthday too. Oh, three
Por te pre- one of those screens where you draw and then can erase it
Ah, how nice
Because she likes them, she, she already knows them, and she likes them, she draws little lines and then she erases them, and, I won't give the to her yet because they're very small and she'll put them in her mouth
But meanwhile, you'll give her the pencil and the screen
Ah, how nice
But yes, because little things like that
I'm excited.
Of course, you see, then. Those things like that are nice to do, so I bought the same thing for little Andrea. And that was it,
And you know who else has a birthday coming?
On the same date
that I remember from when I was there
My father in law, who
Your father in law, yes
Him, him, Juan Luis, Sandra's youngest son.
Oh, yes, yeah
Also on the twenty- the twenty ninth. I also remember that more or less around the same date, I remember that they were all around the same date.
I don't remember of his of being in I didn't know at least.
I haven't gone to any birthday to Sandra's house. I went to only one, but I don't remember, to tell you the truth.
Eh, it was in April, then, when i went to Chile it was April
OK, that was another birthday, she has three.
No, but Sandra will not celebrate her birthday, she won't have a party that year
no, no, okay
No, she said no, just for the family, because they're going to buy something better for the kid
yes, it's true
And really, she makes parties that are too big
she spends too much, yes
too much, she spends too much on that and they can't buy what they really want for the kid
what they really want, exactly
they, of course. They have to decide between one or the other, so yes, this year, the kid decided he wants just the family
The youngest of all
ah, okay
And, and he says, I don't want any clothes
Poor thing
I don't want books, only toys
Carolina.
Tamara, ¿how are you?, uh
Yeah, ¿and you?
I'm in Seattle, Washington state
Wow, I'm in Los Angeles.
Oh, yeah
Yes, it's just incredible
Yeah
Right now i was making a phone call, and suddenly, i mean, i didn't think today was sunday, i was more asleep than awake, and i, ¡Oh my god!
Yeah, this is, i think this is my twenty three call.
Oh, ok, ok, yeah, because i got an email that they're taking back people that are participating again, uh, because at first you could only participate once
Yes
Yeah, i, it's
It's more like, right, tell me
not so "Conventional"
aha
Watch movies that are on on eh, what do you call it? the festivals, there we go for example, the recently finished International Festival of Latinamerican Cinema
a pretty different message, that's worth seeing but lately I've felt like they're making movies, like to make them
uh huh exactly.
I'm from Panama
Ah, okay I'm from Venezuela
Oh okay
Aha, yes
in, then yes it's true, it's true
We say thus to "Macha" no, because good, if they make films like they want to but yes they leave good ones leave and others, if they don't leave don't leave but
Honestly no. And the same is passing right now with the television. We had cable and now he just has a question of we cut it to a month because no, I don't know suddenly like
that we put ourselves against what we saw that there was a lot of manipulation of the average ones they only pass the news to you that agrees with them they hide the truth
eh then that is concerning those of the reporters and the films then if that's not one film that's really very good very good
but then they repeat and repeat and repeat. Ay My God! What is this? we are paying for this then it's like an annoyance, right now we have like an annoyance with
with mass media we are thus reluctant, yes yes.
I think aha.
Because whenever you see something or they give something to you well stupid
Exactly.
or you have it or they exaggerate to you enough
Exactly.
Ay maginate
And we were there and my husband, you know? this white man, paper white compared to my father and my mother is white so I left more than my father, so
when we left you know that he was American.
Logical, logical.
exactly.
exactly.
exactly
because its not true. and that
so bad what happened.
oh yeah
no no he doesn't remember.
I see
he was there and people was protesting, Why?, the current President didn't do anything to remember the local victims
I think they were called Los de Richos, Chinos. That zone practically disappeared, the whole town
of from Chorrillo
yes, from Chorrillo, exactly
yes, that's were he was. That's were was the police, or part of the polce
which happened a long time ago, then they put it here in Venezuela and I don't know. The Other day i wrote to one of the journalist
which is crazy, what it's really happening is that the press is changing the information, so he appears to be a monster, a dict
ator, well a dictator, we have gone through four elections and for referendums, i can't be more democratic. But it is his personality, his personality is
one in a million, and people don't accept that. It's not a common man, and people don't accept it, then he is the first criticizing that
But specifically, i watch the government's channel there, the national channel. Because the other channels are from the opposition, so of course it's a little bit more of the same.
from the whole world, you compare, this is what is happening there, ah and that also happens with the radio, we listen to public radio, radio that you feel is
they are really saying the truth or at least, you have a different point of view, I mean we don't get the whole truth but sometimes, it's not as
biased as the other one, I don't know, I can't say that what the others say is
aha
false but they do manipulate the information
yes
I don't know if you
Hello?
did you watch, I'm not sure, did you watch a movie named "Auto Fox"
No, I might have, I don't remember
It's a documentary about Fox News
mhm
and well it's about people that used to work there and they said they were forced to lie, they quit the channel and they got together and they started to complain
on a local level, local, to tell the world what's happening there, in Fox News. It's quite interesting, it's something like
"The workers from Fox that are out"
some
Something like "out" from outside
aha
and Fox of Fox News
My name is
Hello my name is Fernanda
from Washington
ah. Which of the two
Washington DC
ah, b
yes Washington State
ah, already and the other
Yes I am here in the state of Idaho and I don't know if you know it
yes yes of course
if this truth because I see lot of that in the movies a lot of truth in my view I don't really quite agree with them
they are not ranked very well you know. Eh, for example they sometimes say it's PG and then you see it eh that movie and really
they have pornography  sometimes and later it'sPG thirteen Sometimes it's not is more calm
and does not have as many things as nudity or profanity to be true to those classifications for me it's not like that sometimes
We don't know the people that critique these movies, and we don't know the classification o, or we don't know what it was from your point of view
Yes, I don't know much about the truth of films
aha
Lets say, I don't have children or nothing like that, then almost I notice...
aha
But I think that the majority of television that are, lets say, if you see during the mid-day that is when a lot of times the kids are at home.
yes
yes
Now lots of things are like normal, that, that I think it will not be.
yes, it is true because, hm and is true because hmm, one time, well I don't have cable dont have, the normal channels, the ones to see.
mhm
And sometimes passing movies that really, uf, if a child of ten years old or nine was in the house and was looking him, it was changing also at the same time that I, I
I stop in that channel, they were things but very, already adult.
Clearly, and
imagine for a moment what type of caricatures are going, well, I remember that one time I was watching TV. Pay attention, in Mexico, I am the city of Mexico
The channel here is 16, then I it was a caricature in English because already at night there is something in English, something in Spanish
and it was a cartoon in English. So I left it on. And, it was my mom, well, peaceful, because she was watching a channel of cartoon
How horrible
She turned off the TV and she had to explain a little because my mom, it surprised her because I had put on a channel of cartoons a normal channel
Then, already the truth, already no already the cartoons don't survive
Yes and that could happen to whichever child that was watching TV
sometimes the cartoons yes
And you cannot be inside let's say if a kid changes you can't skip or see, you have to have faith that , let's say, at least during the day
Yes
The programming does not have any nudity or crudity or nothing like that
yes, yes it's true. But there are not really the cartoons sorry, the Japanese cartoons are are those which have more classification eh, have. In Mexico eh,
of that kind of television, any channel, the, channels, for example that is the five in cartoons
yes
for example, then arrives at ten o'clock at night, eleven and you can watch the TV and they don't transmit so unpleasant programs. Well
in Mexico District, mhm
before, in Mexico. But for example, if you are watching a cable channel you take the risk that the cartoon could be about something sometimes about some
I p-yes, and pi-look, I am from Colombia and I think that in Colombia neit-
Then, oh okay
the television is  much better than here in that way.
because, ca-can be, let's say ten at night and the series on air never are so, you don't take the risk, do you? to be too poor like here. Here
Then her kid was watching eh, the a cartoon channel and then the girl thought to change to TV and em- and wa other channel that was also programmed to them, to kids.
Aha, but you could still see it and I got and told her to, to her mom and she said, oh, there is not problem, that is a channel of
of, of cartoons, of, of they air programs.  And, to tell you the truth I was I was, did not, they did not leave much to the imagination.  It was really like the pose of, well ehm it was an operating room where the woman was having her baby.
Because they are twins, she iss, ehm, both of them are six years old.  And their mom was letting them watch that, well each, each parent lets them see what they
yes no
I think
yes, it is of those, for real those classifications they give. And n- and n- and, of the mainly of the television.  The truth already, already n-
how much __, mom is at home and has her small children of three, four years old, five or more or they are at home and they see, they are watching her soap opera
and always ar- they show scenes where they are the, the, a couple, they are there having sex.
Mmm
And during the day, because sopa operas are on air from six in the morning until night
of course
And they are like that, leaving nothing to imagination
Yes, I
Then, programs are now rated, ans whatching a pornogrpahic scene in TV an any time is normal, and for many
parents, it's becoming, unfortunately, normal
exactly
And I think that if parents talk to the broadcaster, and demand for a more restricted television, of this kind of scenes
I think it would be a little better. But, now, parents are fine if the children watch something like that, there is not problem
if a movie has a sex scene or rude language, for the buyers, well they will laugh
and sometimes, it brings attention because it's a really strong scene. Then, those things sometimes help to
producers to sell
sometimes, and
Then no, Personally I like movies like, I like Disney movies, or
child movies, I like them
Yes,yes
Even if I'm tired I love them. I have some Disney movies here and honestly i don't like movies
of course, of course
one really doesn't know how they will change
no, no, the truth is, this is going honestly too far, you turn on the television and if you, you already see a commercial
of feminine pads and they appear there and they are going to explain there how, and in a while they will put a naked woman and they will
show there how they are putting on the pad.
exactly
but if for example a boy or a girl is watching it and you say if the mom is there she can explain it to them in a good way, and if a friend is there
and they tell them, they can explain it with bad information so,
then yes
like sometimes I see it and like you don't realize how much things have changed.
Good night, my name is Mariza, from Philadelphia.
Mariza, Mariza.
Yes, it's a very complicated and polemic subject.
Right.
Give an answer for. And it ends up being some form of control, right?
They try to control the country through religion and, it may seem positive or negative for a lot of people, because it helps to pray and/or believing in something, for some it helps, and for others...
Right
That, well, they represented a whole project of, ideology, but they really, they're one of the most conservative groups there are in the United States, right?
Uh, yeah.
So, they had a power very, well, very direct, very clear, trying to influence people there at the church.
At the sermon, what specially caught my attention, against the public schools.
directly against public school, and they prayed that god will rid us from public school some day.
¿Really?
Because if
Oh, oh no.
Oh, yeah, I've heard that, yes.
No, terrible, they said ¿why are they harassing teachers that teach the bible to explain how the world was created?
Exactly, yes, there are a lot of trouble, yes.
Yeah, the right-wing fundamentalists, yeah, yeah. But also, the country is, uh, the party in power is, that everyone, from the president to the, everyone in it is, on the white house they're all right-wing conservatives.
The right to abortion, the right to, for example, like the other question, to homosexuality, gay marriages, the right to believe
What was Charles Darwin theory of evolution. And
yes
And is very complicated also, of, the other question was over the homosexuality, yes, yes, yes we all were the same or believe the same, it wont be problems like this, he question.
yes
On that sense, the difference help to compliment.
The talk, the talk about homosexuality is very controvercial.
mhm
But in one specific moment, is not a, oh lets go, like tolerancy of phenomenon of the homosexuality should be something, that,that in which need to be very well informed, no, I personally for example was not thinking that....
No
hm,so homosexuals, or lesbians and, I`m very informed and then for that, always I don't know why. From what I`m, from when I was a girl so.....
so yes.
yes
They should have the right to marry, to live with anybody.
mm
Like it's a paradox not to be able to accept that they think differently, but, aha
What happens is this: it's that in this country that when children are in, those types of families, the Christian families that, are right-wing, let's say that those children are raised in a way that, that starting from birth they are taught that they need to be like this, and this, and this, therefore,
When they are older and meet people that are different then they say "it's not like that, because they taught me that this, and this, and this, and you have to be..."
For example, I was lucky to travel a lot and meet people from many races, from many cultures, therefore I am, well, open to everything.
And that is why when I see a person who is not, I immediately recognize it, just with one glance I say, this person is not going to accept me because I am not like her, I am not, I do not think the same, I do not look the same.
the message is very clear it has been five years since goverment, and Bill Clinton has been in Government well he was not as he was more open of course he was left more open another person.
Saying how things are done in the country and that is why there is so much controversy, with marriage there are also with the supreme court with,with the judges that want to be right also and that they are religious well, yes
be or catholics or whatever they also want that. they take abortion rights and things then so it is it is ridiculus at this point in century.
But this is why we are now.
yeah and you have? do you practice a particular religion?
Me in my family we are.In Spain I'am ca-catholism lets say soon as you are born they baptize you.first communion and all that, well got married in church.
Yes but they do not have economic power that is the problem
mhm
Hi, good evening.
yes, good evening.
What's up Alex?
from Los Angeles.
Ah, very good, I am, I'm from New York.
Uh huh.
I'm here from Los Angeles.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm from Peru.
Oh, okay.
Eh, I'm from the Colombian residence.
Mhm.
Because here people speak Mexican Spanish
Aha
That's why.
One gets, one gets the accent from where you live.
With the, when I was living in Spain, I had the a-, the Spanish accent
Mhm.
Mm. Mhm.
Ah, that's good.
Aha, yes.
Yeah, sure, aha
yes.
and  ah, I have the -D-S-L quickly now
Mhm
yes I love it because of the quick internet, I don't like to wait for the pages.
Mhm, Ya aha
I like to do it quick, and and before when I was when I had the line over telephone
yes.
And so had I had to wait two or three minutes only for a page to appear
Yah, ofcourse.
it's quick.
Mm, yes, of course.
And you?
Well, for me, too, of course and I work, my jo-, I am an administrator and so eh, my job for me the computer, so
yes.
So, the truth is I have adapted very well and have been fascinated since I have been using the computer, well before they used this writing machine, that was so slow to
for me, it's essential
moving day after day, right
mm, of course, I think that they have, they have made more advances in computing than they have done with medicine.
You're right.
yes
wants he finds it there and so when one sits well, I use it for work, but also when I'm home and when I need
yes, exactly.
For everything, because if you need to know how the temperature is outside, well you go to the computer.
News, sports.
Ah, going out with women, everything
yes yes yes
No, and even this survey we're filling right now, I found it through the computer too
Oh, that too, yes, oh
yes, hmm, then the computer has a lot of influence
in our lives. 22, this is sh- eh, 22 calls
Yes, yes
Because I spoke in Spanish, then I think they'll accept it
Hmm, yes
Because if you speak in English, no, they won't accept it
But, the payment is made after you finish the 25 calls, right?
if you make a, a call to replace another
yes, oh, yes, yeah
I spoke to him, I know this thing's owner
Yes, i will ask if i have to replace him.
Yes
Oh, very good
Yes, it is very easy to talk with him.
Oh, is he from California?
No, he must be from Philadelphia.
Oh, ok, ok, OK
But, he gave me the telephone
Oh, but you know him personally?
No, no, no, no
Ah, just through the computer
yes, i know him through the computer, but he
through the internet, OK
but he take part of the conversation with other people
Oh, really?, i never talk with him.
Ok, then you can ask anything. He's chinese.
Oh, yes?
Yes, well, he is the owner.
Oh
the, the manager
yes.
Mhm
One in English and another one in Spanish
oh, this is your second one, yes?
yes, and this one that  we are doing now is technology.
oh, oh
because it's doing connections via the telephone
yeah, yeah, oh, and the other one was the same, twenty-five calls?
and that is technology. Yes. Something like that, it was the same thing, but it was in English
and paid the same.
To speak Spanish
Of course.
Mmm yeah.
Oh, yeah, I see.
Yeah.
What we are doing now couldn't have been done twenty or thirty years a go.
Because they are using multiple lines at the same time to connect people that live in different parts of the country.
I think that the phone technology has help in the way that I can make long distance calls and I don't have to pay anything cause you pay
ah, yeah a monthly cost
yes.
Oh, but here in
And that wasn't-, that wasn't what it was like five, ten, twenty years ago
sure, but here in the United States
Here in the United States, yes.
and they gave it to and meanwhile they charged me.
yes. Sure.
Yeah, okay.
How good would that be, right? yeah, that would be excellent for calling to the country whenever you wanted I think that if you're going to arrive, because with one of those cards also, right? Every day
And now it's cheaper, right?
Right now it's incredibly cheap, sure.
That, sure, yes, well yes.
yes, technology.
Now you can talk for three, four or five hours for five dollars.
Before it was a minute, oh my God it was like eight
A minute was twenty cents, yes.
and I had to be very careful and have the clock right in front of me, no?
yes, yes, yes, I that has happened to me too
yes, aha
that yes, yes, yes, ah, I know that, what it is, you must have the clock
Aha, sure, ah, yes.
yes, but eh, with, with
What happens is that it's advancing and and technology is already in the hands of, of more people
Mhm. Mhm.
then services are cheaper, because they sell to more people
Na- sure, yes
mhmm
for example, the computer, the computer five years ago was worth two or three thousand dollars
exactly, yeah
today you can buy a computer for two or three hundred dollars
oh, yeah, that's true.
since there's more demand
Now sure, sure, yes.
that's true
hmmm
I want to sice more advancement in deseases, I think they're going too slow in that matter.
hmmm, yeah
I haven't seen much advancement in diseases in the last ten, twenty, thirty, forty years.
Well-
and they can't find a cure for it, ¿right?, and they cand find it, ¿right?
Uh, yes, yes, yes.
Or, or the heart illness too.
Uh um. AIDS, it's now spreading everywhere
AIDS is more advanced that cancer in, in,
Well, that's true.
in the way of being controlled, because now they have drugs to control it.
But cancer is going very slow, i think.
No, no, no, no, it's true.
I haven't, nothing.
Very slow.
They could improve on that.
yes.
yes, yes.
That shows up in any person.
I, I had a friend that died young, she was thirty two years old and she got cancer from one day to the next
yes, aha
and she died in three days.
And, and she died immediately, she had luki- leukemia, of, of the blood
Oh, yeah.
Oh my god.
Mm.
I haven't, no, eh a-
