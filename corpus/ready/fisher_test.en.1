Okay ,  do you have a favorite bands ?

Who's speaking ?

Hi eh ,  Today's topic is frankly touching huh ? 
Exactly ,  now I said ,  well it's going to be the memories ,  I said well ,  the memories are like precisely the most important thing that life can bring you ,  because one lives ,  like ,  of memories ,  right ? 
And they said ,  no girl  ,  what is that ?  Look ,  jeez seriously ,  but look the power of TV is
Of course ,  of course ,  and we went here .  How are you ? 
Uh .  What else ?  Let's see what else .  After that I didn't have any other official boyfriend until S  ,  more than ,  yes ,  truly the experiences that I never had in some manne  experience like I don't even know ,  right ?  Thank God . 
It's impossible then that they maintain a right ?  A situation that way of that ay , 
your boyfriend ,  because .  and she said ,  "well ,  it's just that ,  it very ,  it's very hard to me to break up with him" .  And told her ,  "¿Why ? " ,  and she said
And then ,  wow ,  i told her ,  ¿What ?  ,  ¿How can you possible love someone that hits you ,  that hurts you ?  .  sometimes she came ,  uh ,  bruised ,  or sometimes
We are in the extremes exactly .   how great .   And where are you from ? 
Ah ,  ok ,  ok .  Chilean ,  of course .  no ? 
that's good ,  where are you from originally ? 
Ah ,  you're uh ,  you're calling every day ? 
and they treat me to speak in Arabic ,  I don't know .  They found me the face most of the Indian or something loke that but sure ,  ¿and there are discrimitation or not ? 
they denied that to you ,  medical attention ? 
Exactly .   It's a problem ,  it's a cycle that works with earnings and it is stronger ,  right ? 
Uh uh .  Uh uh .  Well yes look ,  yes
of parents that cannot pay . 
Oh ,  Look that ,  yes I only knew about the and thought it was for me .  And me smaller without getting tired and like that
Mm .  I'm going to crash . 
maybe they ,  maybe they have I don't know ,  something that can help you in a
yes ,  yes ,  is very simple because in reality ,  well on one side the maintenance is a medicine that this person that helped with the sample said no man this
here they give us ,  you have no problem .  No more do you see some community center or something and
Mm . 
there are a lot of signs .  And ,  but knowing a little more about the advances .  it's that I can give the medicine we think that a stronger diagnosis could improve my son's life with
because it was under control but ultimately now he has about two years that it has been uncontrolled .  It has been under control . 
And ,  well He gives it to me ,  gives it to me yes .  yes ,  they gave him another .  They increased its effectiveness and he got sick and then Well either way ,  he had to stop and go back to the basics . 
yes ,  yes ,  then it's that now you know ,  it's a question of experimenting . 
Well yes ,  sometimes yes . 
Always yes . 
life even though you don't say it's always unsettled ,  all the time . 
Mm . 
It happens in school and then he feels really bad . 
Yes ,  yes ,  it's a stigma .   It's a stigma .   What he has ,  no ?  so
seventeen . 
Per se ,  well getting back to the theme I believe that there should be some good ones here
system of ,  uh
From the doctors .   A the medical centers where there are schools of medicine . 
Mm . 
Mm .   Yes . 
reasonable .   Something that you'll well be able ,  uh ,  to do .  Sometimes they don't charge anything . 
Uh uh . 
and I a few years ago thought that I had it but in the end I went and since I had diagnosed myself and at the end I found here in the hospital that teaches the University of North Carolina
Uh Uh
They didn't charge me anything and they gave me all the tests . 
Yeah . 
I told him . 
But ,  that isn't ,  we need the social security from your employer .  So that is when they just didn't want to . 
So anyway I'm going . 
Uh uh
Hello ,  how are you ?  Mi name is Juan
Hello ,  hi uh ,  Mateo
I am in San Antonio .  Mateo ,  I think he talked already ,  you are in Philadelphia
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  and you are
ah ,  look ,  I ma glad to talk to you again
yes ,  how have you been ? 
the topic is about thecnical devices ,  I mean the technology ,  the most used devices and how much do you depend on them and how you consider the dependency . 
yes ,  the most obvious is the computer ,  but ,  is not the only one
ah
yes ,  and that is why ,  the same thing you buy a car and you are always using it and you always have to give it maintenance ,  you always have ,  is part of your life
yes yes , exactly also because I am here in Texas
ah
I feel that car culture here is kind of the way culture was also for horses in the days
yes
the life we have they take care of them here and it is as important as the horse was in that era
yes
some years ago ,  and well if they do not say in our era of communication the most important elecronics are the ones that have to deal with communication and computer
yes because in Texas yes but even there in Texas
but
yes
so that
ah , yes yes
yeah
of the most important
yes ,  but ,  the questions in the topic were which
well ,  for me it would be my computer and cellphone
aha ,  exactly
aha
aha
before ,  I did not have a cellphone until I became twenty years old ,  but now that I live in Philadelphia ,  in the city ,  and that I'm not always at home for 
yes ,  yes
well ,  I am always ,  I am always ,  I always have my cellphone
you have your cellphone
I think that it is very surprising that almost the whole world has a cellphone ,  here in the United States
yes ,  I notice that ,  it is very important what you just said ,  some time ago ,  when I worked I had the type of job in which the computer was the most important ,  no ? 
yes
yes
The computer was the most important
but now
but now ,  with the kind of work that I'm doing ,  the car it's the more important than the computer ,  because the car let's me do the work I'm doing
But it's because the kind of work
Well ,  for me ,  I think that ,  well ,  you're in Texas and obviously there are more free land and contryside ,  and
a lot more space
yes , yes
because in the cities ,  having a car can be an inconvenient thing also
yes ,  that's right
because you have to park it and ,  well ,  parking is expensive and you can't find any gas stations near ,  and ,  well ,  I don't know ,  is
it's better to have a car I think
yes ,  well ,  here ,  yes ,  because the distance you have to drive to work ,  the car is essential
Of course
the other question ,  the communication electronics ,  right ?  ,  the cellphone and
yes
and then ,  the other question is if you consider that this technologies are more of a problem than of
aha
let's say ,  those problems here ,  but in the end ,  I don't know ,  I don't know what you think ,  more ,  more than anything I would say that ,  well regarding cars ,  car issues ,  and ll that well you don't see a big problem unless that
we considered it like a problem interests created around ,  around the car industry and how they sometimes appear to affect the same development of technology of
yes
ah  yes we look like seventy five years ago there were no cars ,  but today almost everyone has
yes yes ,  yes but ,  yes
the same thing with computers they have ,  they have computers that that are not going to let out in the market for ,  for like ten years ,  because
well
because they already have the  the very advanced things and the things have not they have not
yes
at one hundred kilometers with just one liter of gas
aha
yes
I say no ,  many are saying that they are not cost effective and that in reality is a matter of manipulating company image ,  when the times comes for viewing performance tables
I though hybrids cars would be more efficient I think the efficiency they have achieved is minimum
yes
yes ,  that was an important change
don't you think is an important change ,  or
ah
one , ah ,  according to the tables an economical car can provide you with thirty six miles per galon
yeah
and a hybrid can give you fifty
ah no ,  ah yes sure ,  sure ,  there are some cars there ,  as for example the the Fords
uhm well
the pickup ,  well the pick up trucks are being changed so that they become more efficient ,  you know . 
aha
but ,  the Expedition and that type of huge cars ,  they do use lots of gas ,  you can only drive around twenty or eighteen miles per gallon or something like that ,  it's a huge amount
the small cars ,  the new ones that are not yet in the American market ,  that are now in the European or Latin America's markets have to be more efficient
ah ,  yes
and smaller ,  isn't it ?  So ,  if we buy a car at the price of a hybrid car and we compare it against a small European car or to one of those cars of Latin American ,  well
it's a  lot more expensive to have a car because the initial cost and because you will save money on gas ,  then
European
yes ,  it's like ,  yes
most of the countries have small cars ,  well ,  different ,  it's a different culture ,  you know ,  but
yes I do ,  a few years ago it had something to do with the oil ,  in the eighties or around that time ,  I don't remember
ah ,  aha
I thought that was going to change ,  that the culture was going to change because they started making smaller cars here in the United States . 
yes ,  but
so I thought ,  oh well ,  the culture is going to change but it didn't it was like a temporal thing ,  because they still have lots of huge cars ,  they still
I am Ana Maria
Ah ,  Faviola ,  hello
Hello Faviola
Very good ,  sunny or cold
sunny and cold ,  ah . 
Cold
yes
I had already touched on this subject before . 
I had not touched and I touched talking about ,  specifically the person that talked to me talked about violence
mhm
No ,  he liked the idea of going to see the movies I say ,  that the world is the world .  It has violence
mhm
It has always had ,  and I have experience teaching children love and peace on the television ,  or in the world and then when they face the world which is the school area . 
They are the children that do not know how to defend themselves .  Especially when you have unique children . 
yeah
then uh ,  I find that if the classification is good ,  they have ,  I think it is the responsibility of the adults where children can go to watch television . 
I agree ,  it is the ultimate responsibility of the parents . 
They are doing their job with the movies ,  and
and making their money ,  what is your job
is your business ,  you . 
doing your business ,  yes
if now he wants it ,  you take ,  he want to see it ,  he doesn't is no longer their responsibility ,  they see
of ,  yes
that sells
yes
and it is what they do ,  it's not their fault ,  only of the one who buys
yes ,  that they like the product in the end ,  that's why
yes
with you that you are have the greatest responsibility ,  be violence ,  sex ,  whatever you want to protect a child for ,  i think the parents have the greatest responsibility ,  although you have a rating
because if you have a movie rating for example ~PG thirteen
yes
And you have e minor child of that age to see it ,  it's your responsibility
yes
Exactly
The why ,  the association ,  or ,  whatever he puts ,  eh ,  you have the rating and he already has it ,  then , 
I think yes ,  look that we think almost the same on that Faviola because ,  in the end the responsibility of raising and caring and what you want him to see or not
Your children ,  or your family .  Eh ,  you like a mother or your husband like a mother . 
mm I think as well that I am completely in agreement and the other ,  normally the children have access to television when the parents are outside . 
Exactly
The children are alone
mhm
And there the father isn't there to teach them or say to them this you shouldn't watch ,  yes you should see
Or if they go to a sleepover you don't know also
Of course you don't have a clue
If they go to a sleepover and they put a movie on ,  they watch the movie or they don't have control in that house or whatever it is
You also don't know
Exactly . 
I think what's important is given the kids a ,  that they respect that ,  signs if one gives them good principles in the house .  One as a family teaches them those things , 
Of course
Really I don't like that ,  or because I don't like it .  That you see it ,  or that you are not prepared ,  or that the moment will come
That ,  because like they say you can't keep them in a crystal box
No and also
goes exposed or exposed
Yes also and when the kids get to a certain age .  My son had fifteen years ,  sixteen sixteen years and he would say don't worry because you did the best that you could
mhm
ah ,  it is the twenty five percent of the genes and the education and the rest is decision my decision of my life
Look ,  with that
Of course ,  then I learned .   Oh wait ,  no eh ,  oh ,  I was and
mm
My cell phone was ringing .   OK OK leave that and I answer . 
OK
eh ,  don't hang up because we have to talk twelve minutes . 
yes
I just went to pay it
OK ah
And about people I believe that I love movies ,  watching horror movies . 
OK
But there are times when ,  when they scare me and I'm an adult . 
You ,  you scare yourself , 
they make me scared and I'm going to find out about horror movies . 
OK OK .   But your responsibility is to see it ,  and you scare yourself . 
yes
OK well I don't like them and I don't watch them I don't watch any kind of those .   That's also my decision ,  even being old enough to see them ,  if it is too violent ,  I don't want to see it . 
Yes .   Because of that I respect what my son told me that time ,  fifty per cent is responsibility , 
Yes
of ,  of the individual ,  of the person ,  eh ,  you already did what you could ,  but there is a time when children before turning eighteen . 
That some are more mature than others . 
Yeah
And they start to watch the R movies . 
Um
at fourteen and fifteen years ,  and eleven ,  twelve year old children are watching the PG thirteen . 
Yeah ,  yes . 
And sometimes even little ones .  Sometimes even younger ,  because i remember Jenny's friend ,  that watched Harry Potter ,  and it's
Yeah ,  thirteen ,  right . 
PG thirteen ,  PG fourteen ,  and then i say ,  Jenny doesn't like it ,  it scares her . 
Right
She's cared of monsters and all that . 
Yeah
But ,  yeah ,  i agree that for the most part ,  in the end it's about the criteria you make for her .  Take care of them if you don't want them to watch TV when they're alone . 
Yeah ,  'cause ,  because
Not leaving them alone with the TV
But imagine that you still can't control them . 
But it's just TV ,  no more you . 
That's why I'm telling you ,  you can control them ,  "you can't watch this movie because this and this reason ,  because you're not mature enough" or whatever you want to tell them ,  ¿right ? 
And you have to have some judgment to watch some movies . 
Yeah ,  that's why I'm telling you ,  you get nothing from telling her ,  "you can't watch that" ,  so ,  because there will be a time when she'll go to a house ,  how can i say ,  her friend's house . 
aha ,  in the same school they show movies . 
Oh the same school ,  but the same school is a bit more supervised because that is already a different thing .  Because because it goes ,  it goes with an end . 
They show documentaries . 
but I'm more afraid when he goes to friends' houses .  And sometimes they have the television in the piece ,  the most that it is used ,  or the computer or whatever it is . 
Maybe they are looking at something inadequate .  But that's what I say ,  whatever happens ,  it's that my son and my daughter or whatever it is , 
Continue like ,  like superman the little boy that climbed on the window and killed himself . 
It ,  of course ,  because you know that they are not yet prepared . 
aha
yes Okay
yes ,  yes ,  I am preparing myself I am already buying my family's presents .  But at the moment I am with everything ,  with other things on my mind . 
you're on a birthday no . 
yes but ,  but I am already preparing ,  buying presents for the family at least for my nephews .  I already have them ready ,  we have already bought them presents ,  then the big people remain no less . 
That's what I was going to tell you
I am going to cook .  yes ah
yes ,  also for some kids ,  yes ,  too
No that ,  the table thing
yes ,  the ,  the yes too ,  but i have no time ,  i still have to wait until mid ,  until the last week of December to do it . 
Oh ,  because they're
because i have no time before . 
Yes ,  and that's what I'm doing too .  That's why i'm doing some gifts  ,  but for example .  am ,  the Andreita ,  for example it's her birthday soon . 
Oh ,  ok ,  yes ,  but i remember that it was like three days . 
For the re  a screen of those that draw and erase . 
Oh ,  that's so nice . 
Because she likes it ,  right ,  she already met them and she likes them ,  she draws little lines and then she erases them ,  and she has  the i am not going to give them to them yet because they're very little and she would put them in her mouth . 
Aw ,  that's very nice . 
It's so exciting
Right ,  so ,  you see .  Things like that are a joy to do ,  so i bought the same for little Andrea .  And that's it
¿Who ? 
That i remember ,  when i was there
My father in law ,  that
Your father in law ,  yeah
Him ,  Juan Luis ,  Sandra's youngest son
Oh ,  yeah ,  right . 
Also on ,  on the twenty nine .  I remember that also around the same date ,  i remember that they're all around the same date . 
No ,  you were there ,  you went to Chile once and you left her the gift for his birthday
Oh ,  well ,  that was on April ,  it was April when i went to Chile
Ok ,  that was another birthday ,  because she's three
I leave the presente there
yes ,  for her nephew who came after
Of course he came ,  he told me after i gave it to him ,  but he didn't say his name
Sandra will not organise her birthday ,  she will not make a party this year
no ,  no ,  OK
I didn't say no ,  i mean just for the family ,  because they are going to buy something better for the kid
yes ,  that's true
That's because she does a very big parties
yes very ,  yes
She spend a lot of money in that and now she can't afford it to the kid
what they really want ,  exactly
they have to decide between one or another thing ,  this year the kid decided to be with the family
to have a special gift
Sure ,  to have one more present
Juan Luis is the oldest or the youngest
The smallest kid of all
oh ,  yes
and he said he doesn't want any clothes
Poor kid
I don't want books i just want toys
Carolina
Tamara
yea ,  and you ? 
Im in washington ,  seattle
wow I'm in los angeles . 
oh yeah
yeah ,  its incredible ,  its great
yeah
I was making a call and then i realized that it was sunday ,  i fell asleep for half an hour more than usual ,  i was like oh my god . 
yeah this is it ,  i think this is my twenty third call
wow you're almost ready ,  I'm halfway there ,  im on the tenth part . 
yeah ,  and this is the second time i take their services . 
oh okay okay ,  yeah because i casually received a letter that they are taking intakes so they can participate again ,  because at first you could have only participated once . 
yes i know
That's good ,  tell me
Well I'll tell you honestly ,  it's been more than a year since we stopped watching movies on regular film . 
little "conventional"
aha
We had a movie ,  for example in the case of film ,  it's the same as with the television .  Now we see this documentary style films  .  .  .  Eh ,  with other messages then . 
more important things to talk about
Exactly ,  exactly
Sometimes ,  because we had little children ,  they want to watch movies with use ,  and we take them ,  but not usually .  Time ago we went like two or three times per moth to the cinema
No no ,  and then we started to get information in other kinds of movies ,  and well ,  we moved completely to that side ,  right now are with
a movement like those ,  we are kind of intellectual ,  but now ,  we have reach a stage where you feel like
a really different feeling ,  they are worth ,  but lately I think they are making movies just for doing them
yes ,  exactly
I'm from Panama
Oh ,  Okay ,  I'm from Venezuela
Oh ,  okay
Right ,  yes
in ,  then ,  it is true ,  it's true
Honestly ,  not .  And the same is happening now with the TV .  We had cable and just about a month ago we cut it because ,  i don't know ,  suddenly it was like
we were against that ,  we saw there was a lot of manipulation from the media ,  they only show you the news that they want ,  they hide the truth
uh ,  so that's the news level ,  and about the movies ,  so it's like yeah ,  why not ,  a good movie ,  a really good movie
with the media we're like reluctant ,  yeah ,  yeah
Yeah ,  what you're saying it's true .  Over here i ,  my husband and i ,  we watch the news . 
I think ,  right
Because every time you watch something or they show you something really stupid
Exactly
Or they exaggerate it a lot
Exactly
Because ,  when i was ,  we were in Panama before Noriega got out of Panama
Oh ,  imagine that
And we were there ,  and my husband ,  you know ,  he's a white man ,  paper white compared to my dad ,  my dad is brunette and my mom is white ,  so i was darker than my dad ,  so
when we went out ,  you knew he was American
Yeah ,  obviously
And we both got ,  we got into where we were going ,  and he had to go to work into the base and i had to go with him or something like that
of course
and suddenly we would arrive home and we would watch TV ,  there was so much little things that happened at Panama ,  I would watch him
exactly
and the next day the same thing I say ,  ay what an ex agente .  I think they were teaching the thing that they showed last week and exaggerating the thing so
Exactly , 
the news nothing like that .  that is what I tell my kids do not believe everything that the TV says . 
right
Just when the Noriega problem and everything else we looked all the documentary I stood cold ,  because in reality I never imagined it to be so depressing and so
so horrible what happened
That was the documentary they talked about the man that got his head chopped off . 
and oh yeah
no he doesn't remember
I don't remember exactly don't remember but .  .  .  what I remember is that night when they bombarded and so many people died ,  even nowadays they showed one
i think they were called The Risho's ,  from the Chinese sector ,  where all that village practically disappeared
Oh ,  from Churillo
Uh ,  from Chorrillo ,  exactly . 
Right .  But that one you're talking about ,  look ,  it happens just like that in Venezuela with the current president .  Some things are happening that ,  you know they're happening
Univision .  I told them not to be so cynical ,  don't show things that aren't real ,  the first thing people tells you is ,  "huh ,  that president"
It's uncommon ,  and people doesn't accept that .  And he's not vulgar ,  he's not common ,  and people doesn't accept that ,  so he even is the first to criticize all that
Sure ,  sure .  look ,  there's a website in the internet where you can watch TV from all countries ,  including Panama of course ,  it's called
But I specifically watch the government channel there ,  the national channel .   Because the other channels belong to the opposition ,  so of course it is a little more of the same
OK
Then I compare it and since I have this webpage now I don't turn the TV on .   Now we are there glued to the internet watching the channels from
damn truly they manipulate it too much . 
Did you give yourself one ,  I don't know if you saw here a movie called Auto fox
no ,  maybe but I don't remember
It was a documentary that worked at Fox News
mmh
and well they practically forced them to say what was not and then they decided to resign from the station and besides resigning they got together and started to protest at a certain level
well ,  at a certain ,  a local level to tell the world how they were doing inside Fox News .   It is very interesting ,  it is called something like
How is  ? 
from Washington
Washington ,  ~DC
Yes ,  Washington State
Ah ,  OK and the other
Yes I'm here in Idaho state ,  I don't know if you've heard of it . 
Yes ,  yes ,  yes of course
Yes ,  this one ,  the truth is a lot of that is movies ,  the truth is ,  a lot of things , em from my point of view really there isn't much in common with me because after
you don't know how to classify it very ,  very well .  Eh ,  for example ,  after sometimes they say it's ~PG and after eh ,  you see that movie and really
You have a lot of profanity and ,  and pornography that sometimes is more forward for example ~PG thirteen sometimes is more ,  I don't know ,  it's quieter
And there isn't too many things like nudity and profanity .  For me honestly ,  ah those classifications for me no ,  sometimes no
They don't know ,  people that critique those movies no ,  don't know how to classify them or ,  or I don't know what your point of view would be . 
Yes ,  honestly I don't know much about movies because
ha
lets say ,  i don't have kid or anything ,  so I'm never aware
ha
what ,  what a classification
ha
but i think that the majority of people that we have ,  lets say during half day ,  is when most kids are at home
ha
they're things that are not really appropriate for the majority . 
yeah
more things are normal ,  i don't think they should be that way
yeah ,  that's true ,  because ,  once ,  well ,  i don't have cable ,  i have normal cable ,  the ones that
ha
so that i can choose my program ,  that I'm going to see during that time . 
i stopped in that channel ,  there were things that were for adults
of course
The I said ,  ufm I said I thought the kids ,  I said ,  well ,  I ,  I I'm married ,  three years married and i have ,  a boy of almost 2 years old
OK
Maybe my son will grow and maybe this will move forward for the worst .  Then
Um
It was ten at night exactly ,  ten at night .  Then ,  I had ,  eh ,  I had cable there and had the ,  the ,  the cable to
and there was an English cartoon .  Then I quit .  And ,  thi  my mom was  ,  then ,  then ,  was quite watching a cartoon television channel
eh ,  on Cablevision and Multivision ,  which would be what cable here there in Mexico ,  doesn't have too many restrictions .   But for example ,  on regular television ,  normal channels
they have like more ,  more restrictions .   Eh not so much on other cables and ,  for example in ,  on TV ,  for example ,  normal channels for children
in Mexico City ,  mmh
before ,  in Mexico .   But for example ,  if you are watching a cable channel you already risk that the cartoon can be about something that sometimes that some
I yes ,  I look ,  I am Colombian and I think that in Colombia
Then ,  uy aha
television is much better that here in this sense . 
Then her boy was watching eh ,  the a cartoon channel and then the girl decided to change the TV and and it was another channel that also was programmed for them ,  for children . 
Aha ,  but you could see it and I grabbed her and I told her ,  to her mother and she told me ,  there is no problem ,  it is a channel of
of ,  of cartoons ,  of ,  of they show shows .   And ,  sincerely it was it was ,  no ,  they didn't leave much to the imagination .   It was really like posing ,  well but it was an operations room where the woman was having her baby . 
whatever they want .   But honestly ,  I ,  I don't want to explain so much to my children at this moment ,  because honestly I watch more what they
they don't leave nothing to the my  to the imagination ,  they show it to you . 
yes
Already at any at any time of the day you watch one of those soap operas .   I don't like watching soap operas .   But ,  you see
And in broad daylight ,  because the soap operas then passed from one to six in the morning until it was dark . 
No ,  I
Then ,  the programs are already sorted ,  and a scene of pornography on television at any time of day is normal .  And for many
parents ,  this unfortunately is normal . 
They don't care ,  mhm . 
That will be taught .  And then ,  so will these classifications I do not like .  And I don't think these producers care .  I feel that to them it is because
Sometimes ,  and
Then ,  no .  For me in particular ,  the movies I like to tell you the truth are Disney
Yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
Though now I'm married and I love all that .  I have some here from another Disney movie .  Honestly ,  I do not like movies . 
so now yes
like i sometimes i see that i don't realize how much are changing the things
Good evening ,  I'm Mariza from Philadelphia . 
Mariza ,  Mariza . 
Oh ,  maybe yes . 
It could be ,  I'm in San Antonio ,  Texas . 
Okay ,  so today's theme is ,  uh ,  the question of religion . 
Exactly ,  like how the need for religion is something that ,  that we all have ,  I suppose . 
And this like all needs institutions try to , 
Yes , 
It is really today in this country .   Uh ,  in the United States too ,  there's a big ,  big problem with religion ,  that it mixes with politics and there are a lot of people on the right who want control . 
Mm hm
That totally represented an ideological project ,  but that by plan is among the most conservative groups there is in the United States . 
yes
In the sermon , above all what attracted my attention against the public school . 
Why what yes , 
ah ah , no
and against the theory that , that they try to see the evolucion theory , no . 
So that I have heard that , yes . 
Exactly , yes there are many problems , yes . 
No each can believe what they want ,  what happens is that they try to impose their  belief for all the world and to be the bible that it be the what think
Exactly , they are fundamentalism , no
Yes what fundamentalism yes , yes , yes the right but it ia also the country is eh , the power is with the party and the All from the president and all involved in is ,  in the white house they are all the conservative rights . 
The right to have an abortion , for example how another question was about homosexuality ,  gay marriages ,  the beleif right the of
yes more scientific no , no we should not believe only on what they say ,  they say God created man and woman also to give an opinion so the children can beleive . 
that was Charles Darwin the theory of evolution .  And
But
But I think that maybe ,  the more similar we are ,  the more problems we have ,  no . 
Sure ,  for me ,  I don't have any , 
The topic ,  the topic of homosexuality is very polemic , 
mhm
But in a given time ,  it's not a ,  let's see ,  like tolerance the phenomenon of homosexuality must be something ,  that ,  that in which we're very well informed ,  no ,  I personally think for example before I thought , 
it could be a deviation ,  homosexuality ,  but lately I have read that it's also a question ,  a genetic issue . 
Like you accept people for ,  I didn't think that they were better nor worse for being homosexuals and everyone has a right to to ,  well I don't know ,  to marry ,  to , 
Well yes , 
to be with whom they want .  It's the same if it's a man or a woman ,  I care ,  I don't care and I think that they have the same rights because they are citizens all the same ,  and they pay the same taxes . 
well a lot of people pose the question of homosexuality as an issue ,  very perverse and that they have the right to marriage ,  not when it's a quest  of when the marriage is in reality a contract
mhm
between two people that decide to do something in common . 
No , 
think that that's an abomination because marriage is defined as a union between a man and woman they believe ,  and it ,  and the people and the devoted Christian fundamentalists just like I was saying before they see this as an abomination ,  and they are so closed off that they don't understand that . 
aha
People are accepting the fact that people ,  yeah well if you at a person who's homosexual ,  yes and they're worthwhile people .  So then
The necessity of first to change and find new ,  new ways of learning the lessons of life . 
About society and of individuals ,  right . 
hmm
Is like a paradox to do not accept the difference they think but ,  aha
What happens is that if , It is that in this country the children when they are ,  those families ,  christian families ,  from the right wing ,  let´s say they raise their children in a way that ,  they teach them since they are very little that things must be that way ,  and then ,  then
when they are adults and meet different people then they say ,  that is not that way ,  because I was taught that is like this ,  and this ,  and this and it must be like this
You know they are very radicals ,  not ,  they don´t accept the differences because they were raised in a way their parents did ,  then
yes
For example ,  me ,  I had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of all the races ,  several cultures ,  then I am open minded to everything . 
Yes I they are
With the churches ,  there is a good proportion of fundamentalists even in the president speech there are some fundamentalism , 
Of course ,  yes yes . 
that understood more the things to the persons and ,  this government  take it ,  the religious the christian of righties I mean the ones who are
Saying how things are made in the country and that is why there is so much controversy with marriage it's also with ,  the  supreme court ,  with the jury who want them to be righties and religious ,  well  , 
catholics or whatever they might be they also want to ,  to take off the rights of abortion and stuff like that ,  that is ,  ridiculous in this height of this century . 
But ,  that is how we are right now . 
Me in my family we are ,  In Spain I am cat  Catholicism say is when you are born and they baptize you ,  the first communion and all that . 
I think I'm goo and I have my thoughts but I don't go to church every Sunday nor practice religion ,  I know but don't practice ,  I am I think
But we say that I speak for myself and what we say I will carry with me
yes
or ,  or I'm not and won't be I am very open and it would be contradictory if I thought that I am Catholic but I know I'm not I am not covered
if the same thing happens to me sometimes and when I have a temporary problems with the church because it's Catholic I can almost almost hear you say that there is a sense of integration and community here
It seems they have interest in all . 
mhm
Hi ,  good evening . 
Good evening .  My names is Carolina . 
from Los Angeles . 
oh ,  okay ,  I thought that ,  that ,  that it was another person .  Are you okay ? 
Yeah , 
I am here from Los Angeles . 
please to talk to you . 
Well ,  tonight we have to talk ,  about technical appliances . 
I am from Peru . 
Eh ,  I am of Colombian residence . 
mhm
Oh ,  but you speak like a mexican . 
Right . 
Oh ,  right ,  sure . 
Oh . 
Uh um . 
Uh um . 
Now i got the Mexican spanish . 
Which is what's spoken here . 
Oh ,  and ,  i think that Hispanics here are like ninety five per cent mexican . 
Yes . 
Yes ,  well ,  i use ,  i use computers . 
Yeah . 
Mhm . 
so it's very useful because I'm look for work ,  I do surveys look for women
Mhm . 
Mhm .  Yea ,  aha
it was very slow . 
So I had to wait some two or three minutes just for a single page to appear
Yeay ,  sure . 
The webcam is when they can see you ah ,  like in tele  ,  li  ,  video conference conference
Mm .  Mhm . 
Well ,  to me ,  also ,  sure ,  and i work ,  my work ,  i am a manager ,  and then uh ,  i use it for work and to me ,  the computer ,  i mean that
Yes
And ,  i have really adapted well and I've loved it since i've been using the computer .  Because before ,  when we used the typing machine ,  it was so slow to
Um ,  sure ,  i think that ,  they have ,  uh ,  they have done more discoveries on the computer than what they have on medicine . 
That's true
The computer is the most advanced thing in today's civilization . 
Right ,  yes ,  and for everything ,  ¿right ?  ,  i mean ,  it's all you
Yes
want ,  you can find it there ,  and when you take a seat on the ,  well ,  i use it for work ,  but also when I'm home and i need
Yes ,  exactly
For everything ,  because if you need to know how's the weather out there ,  well ,  you go to the computer
News ,  sports
Before it was ,  um
Ah ,  dates with women ,  everything . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
No ,  and even this survey that we are discussing now ,  I found it online too . 
Oh ,  yes ,  also ,  oh
yes ,  almost mm ,  so the Internet does have a lot of influence
in our lives .  Twenty two ,  this is a ,  twenty two calls . 
Oh ,  and he ,  so you are almost done
Yes ,  I'm almost done ,  I still have three left ,  one of them is a call in which someone spoke mostly in English ,  so I think I will have to replace him . 
Oh ,  I see ,  I see . 
Yeah ,  aha . 
Mm ,  I see . 
Yes ,  they do ,  they replace the call . 
yes ,  oh ,  I see ,  aha . 
And ,  I'm going to ask him if i have to replace him . 
Yes . 
Yes ,  it's easy ,  he's easy to talk to . 
No ,  he must be in Philadelphia . 
But ,  but he gave me the phone num 
No ,  no ,  no ,  no . 
Oh ,  just through the computer . 
But he ,  he talks to the participants . 
Oh ,  ¿yeah ? 
Yeah ,  well  ,  i don't know if he's the owner ,  he is
Oh . 
yes ,  that ,  supervisor of ,  the project they are doing . 
Yes ,  of course and
I don't know ,  if  ,  if you knew . 
No ,  no I don't know ,  but is possible that yes ,  because I ,  I have already done two . 
yes ,  and this what we are doing now is technology
Oh Oh . 
because they are doing connections by the telephone
and this is technology .  yes ,  something like that ,  it was the same thing ,  but it was in English . 
And they paid the same . 
to speak in Spanish
Of course . 
Mm ,  ya . 
Oh ,  OK ,  aha . 
OK . 
This couldn't have been done twenty ,  thirty years ago what we are doing now
Exactly ,  aha
because they are using multiple phone lines to connect many people who live in different parts of the country . 
I believe that telephone technology ,  they have made advances also because now I can make long distance calls and they don't cost me anything because you pay
ah ,  a monthly fee
Aha
and you can make al the calls you want . 
A lot cheaper
Yeah ,  you're right
yes ,  the technology . 
Now you can speak three or five hours for 5 dollars . 
Exactly . 
Before it was only a minute ,  oh my god it was about like eight . 
Yes ,  I remember that I had to talk ,  I think that ten minutes alone used to cost me like twenty five dollaras . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  It also happened to me too
yes ,  like that
yes yes ,  ah ,  I remember that you had to be with the clock in your had . 

<very poorly written phrase but I think this is what was supposed to mean>
Aha ,  Clearly .  Yes . 
Then the services are a lot cheaper because they sell them to a lot more people
Of course ,  yes . 
Mmm ,  cla 
Eh ,  as an example ,  it is the computer ,  the computer five years ago ,  cost about two ,  two or three thousand dollars . 
nowadays you can buy a computer for two hundred or three hundred dollars
Ah ,  yes ,  it is true ,  aha . 
Now of course ,  of course ,  aha . 
Ah ,  yes ,  it is true . 
more advanced technology ,  with medicine . 
True . 
Mm .  Mm . 
Mm ,  OK . 
mm . mm
Yeah , yeah . yeah
Or heart disease as well . 
Mhm ,  HIV ,  since its not mentioned almost everywhere . 
HIV ,  is more advanced than cancer ,  in in
well ,  that's true . 
yeah . yeah . 
no , no , no , no its true . 
HA
its slow
Yes . 
They could improve that . 
Yes . 
Yes ,  yes . 
That anyone can get . 
Yes ,  right . 
Yes ,  because she had a bleeding in her brain . 
And ,  and she died immediately ,  she had luk ,  leukemia ,  in the blood . 
And that ,  she got that overnight . 
Uh
They couldn't ,  uh
