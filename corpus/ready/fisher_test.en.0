Mm
Then any Canadian resident has rights to medical services ,  just to be there and they don't have any economical consequences
No ,  bu  the difference is that they started right
Yes ,  Exactly
It's like Argentina ,  my parents have all the medical bills paid
Oh
All medical coverage is paid ,  they pay a little amount ,  not so much
Yes ,  this is one thing we should make ,  at least paying something
yes
having some type of social security ,  but even that is really
yes ,  its really expensive
all over the world ,  All over the world
And there is more competition there in drugs .  That's weird
Yes ,  there was a drug my son was taking there ,  and well ,  when we moved here we couldn't find it
Oh
So ,  we went to Argentina last year ,  I went to the drugstore and something you pay more than 50 dollars here
i bought it there for 12 dollars
yes ,  yes
12 dollars ,  same company and everything
yes . 
Same .  yes . 
with similar ingredients
Mm
That's true .  It really is true . 
I mean I ,  according to things like this
But
yes . 
Mm ,  mm .  oh yes . 
Eh ,  because they help the children . 
Now I don't know if they specialize in a specific disease .  Or if they cover everything because perhaps
You can communicate with them and say to them ,  he hears we have this boy and this is his condition and this is our situation . 
And perhaps they can help in some way .  Because the Shriners are dedicated to helping ,  to paying for the medical care of children .  That they can't pay . 
of the parents who can't pay . 
Ah .  I noticed that .  Yes I only knew and thought it was for me .  And I much smaller without you tiring and for more style
And also if you call to Catholic Charities
Uh .  Uh uh .  That yes . 
there are many samples .  And ,  but knowing a bit more about the advances is that I can give the medicine that we think that a deeper diagnosis could improve the life of my son with
Sure . 
Mm .  And of course he's growing up and then maybe that medicine doesn't work anymore ,  they have to give him another one . 
Mm . 
Yes ,  yes ,  we was very ill
what a thing . 
yes ,  yes ,  well so you know ,  it's a matter of experimenting . 
And you ,  you must live with your hearts in your mouth . 
and that causes a lot of stress . 
Much stress
the life even if you don't say it your always looking after him ,  all the time . 
Mmm .  . 
Yes it is a heavy load ,  it's a really heavy load for him . 
17
Oh ,  it's just a teenager
Yes .  . Hey ,  getting back at subject ,  I think there must be a a good ones her
Mm
And we do not have
Oh ,  I see
And they take note of whatever they give us ,  and after that they charge
a reasonable account .  Something we can afford ,  sometimes they don't even charge at all
yeah
And a few years ago I thought I had it ,  but in the end I went and I had kind of self diagnosed ,  and in the end I found here the teaching hospital of the University of North Carolina
Yeah
and they didn't charge me anything and they performed all the tests on me
yes
So everything is very well ,  to which orientation are we going ,  right ,  in fact ,  the place I went to precisely is called University System ,  healthcare system or something like that but
Ah ,  yes ,  then it's that with the
Then it's precisely there where they bounced me
I told him
Ah ,  but what a thing
Mm . 
But ,  not that ,  we need the social security of your employer .  And then that's when they didn't want to anymore
They didn't want to give you that information . 
Maybe now you can
Uh uh . 
hi ,  good eh ,  matt here
i am in san antonio Matt i think we have spoken before you are in Philadelphia
yes and you are
oh look its a placer talk with you again
the theme is the technical devices ,  i mean the technology ,  the devices that you use more and you depend of them how do you consider these dependency
yes because it is a machine you know
exactly so ,  yes if the cars seems to be so important  no then i thought better is a computer bu no
yes the most obvious its the computer ,  but its not the only one
OK exactly but sometimes seems like a personal element depending of the case ,  so  it can be a car no because the computer is a tool every time more
oh
yes that's why the same things you buy a car and always you are using it and always you have to mantained ,  always its a part of your life
yes yes ,  exactly ,  besides as I'm here in Texas
ah
I feel that the automobile culture here is like a reminiscence of the culture of the horses too
yes
yes
for some years yes ,  because if they say no the devices that have to do with communication are the most important in our age ,  like computers

<very bad phrase>
yes ,  because ,  here in Texas yes ,  because up here in Texas
but
yes
then
i see
the most most important
yes but ,   ,  the questions on the subject were which
well ,  for me it would be more my computer and my cellular telephone
uh huh ,  exactly
uh huh
uh huh
before ,  I didn't have a cellphone until I was like twenty years old ,  but now that to ,  that I live in Philadelphia in the city and that I'm not always at home for 
yes ,  yes
okay always always I am ,  always I have my cellphone
you have your cellphone
I think that it's very it's like surprising that almost everybody has a cellphone ,  here in the United States
yes
yes
The computer was the most important . 
But now , 
But now ,  With the type of work that Im realizing the auto is the most important .  the computer ,  because the auto is what let you ,  re e el Type of work that Im doing is more . 
But of course is by the type of good work . 
Way more space
yes , yes
For in the city having a auto it can be convenient as well . 
yes , yes ,  that yes . 
Because always you have to try to park and to have to pay a lot to park ,  and the gas station is not close by and ,  I do not know it . 
It is better to have an auto hm I think . 
Yes hm ,  yes .  no maybe here yes ,  for the distance that needs to go in the job ,  the auto is fundamental . 
aha ,  clear . 
aha . 
And that ,  and hm ,  and the other question is if you consider that those hm ,  these technologies will convert more into a problem than ,  than in .  .  .  . 
aha
let's say ,  those problems here ,  but but in the end ,  I don't know ,  I don't know what you think ,  above ,  above everything i would say that ,  well in regard to the care ,  issues with cars and all of that well like it is not seen as a large problem unless it is
we could consider as a problem the interests created around the ,  the auto industry and like sometimes they seem to affect the same technology development of the
yes
s o we look how seventy five years in the past there were no cars ,  but these days almost everybody has
yes yes ,  ,  yes but ,  yes
and the same thing with the computers they have ,  they have computers that are not going to let come out to the market until ,  like ten years ,  because
since
because they have th  the things very advances and the things have not ___ have not _____
yes
one hundred kilometers with only one liter of gas
aha
yes
that ,  at lot of them say that they are not affordable ,  that it's really a matter of image that companies do ,  and when it comes to see the ,  the return tables
of the hybrid cars ,  well ,  I though they would be a lot more efficient ,  but I think what they've achieved is a minimal efficiency
yes
yes ,  that was a very important breakthrough
you don't think it's an important breakthrough
no ,  I don't think it's so important ,  taking into account that the efficiency they show is not radically different from the other cars' ,  I mea
ah
according to the tables ,  an economical car will give you maybe thirty six miles per gallon
yeah
and a Hybrid can give you fifty
no ,  ah ,  yes ,  there are cars now like ,  like the Ford cars
uhm ,  well
aha
by ,  small cars ,  new that are not in the Northamerican market ,  that are in the European or Latinamerican market where they have to be much more efficient . 
oh ,  yes
no  it is much more expensive to have a car which is because of the initial cost and why it will be saved a lot in in gas ,  it ends up
and ,  why is it that
European
yes ,  it is ,  yes
yes I ,  precisely ,  years ago when there was the problem with petroleum ,  in the eighties or something like that ,  I recall
ah ,  aha
I thought that it there was going to be a change in the culture ,  because they started to ,  to develop smaller cares here in the United States . 
yes ,  but
I'm Ana Maria
Ah Faviola ,  hi
Hello Faviola
Great ,  it's sunny but cold . 
Sunny and cold ,  ah . 
Cold
yes
I've talked about that subject before too . 
Yea I've talked about it and I've talked about the uh ,  one I remember specifically talking about was about violence . 
mhm
that it ,  that they didn't like the idea of going to see movies .  And I told them ,  that the world that the world is ,  it has violence
mhm
It's always had it ,  and I've had the chance to teach children about peace and love with the TV or ,  or in the world and later when they go out into the real world at school . 
They find that ,  that kids hit each other ,  that they don't know how to defend themselves .  Especially when you have only children . 
uh huh
so uh ,  I think that it's OK that they rate the movies how they do ,  I think it's the responsibility of adults ,  even where their kids can watch TV . 
I agree ,  the respon  the most important responsibility of parents . 
They are doing their job them of the movies and
They are earning their money ,  what is your job . 
it's his business ,  you
doing his business ,  yes
yes today the one that wants ,  the one that wants to see ,  he doesn't want to see him anymore it is not their responsibility ,  they see
of ,  yes
that they sell
yes
It is what they do ,  it is not their fault ,  it is the fault of those that buy it
yes ,  of who likes the product ,  because of that
yes
with you it is the maximum responsibility ,  if it is violence ,  sex ,  whatever it is protect a child .  The biggest responsibility is of the parents ,  even with classification
Because there is a classification of a movie for example  PG thirteen
yes
And you have a small child of that age and you let him watch that movie it is your responsibility
yes
Exactly
Then because I the the the association ,  o ,  o ,  o ,  whatever it is they one who puts the classifications already has it then
I believe yes ,  we believe more or less the same thing in that Faviola because in the end the responsibility of raising ,  taking are of and wanting them to see or not see
Your sons ,  or your family .   eh ,  You as a mother or your husband as a mother . 
mm I believe also that I agree completely and the other ,  normally the children have access to television when the parents are out . 
Exactly
the kids are alone
mhm
And there is not father to teach them or tell them ,  you should not watch this ,  you should watch
Or if they go to a sleepover ,  you don't know either
Sure ,  no because you don't have any idea
If they go to a sleepover and the watch a movie ,  they watch a movie and they don't have any control at that house ,  or whatever
You don't know either
Exactly
I believe it is important to give to your children one ,  that they respect those ,  signs if yone give them good principles at home .   One as a famly ,  then teach them ,  things
Sure
That really I don't like or why I don't like .   You watch ,  or you are nor ready ,  or the time will come
What ,  because as they say ,  they cannot have them in a crystal box
No ,  and also
go ,  exposed
yes ,  also when the children reach certain age .   Mi son was fifteen ,  sixteen ,  seventeen years old and he tells me ,  don't worry ,  because you did better than you could do
mhm
ah ,  it is twenty five percent genes and education ,  the rest is the decision ,  the decision of my life
Look ,  with that that
Of course ,  then I learned .  Oh wait ,  no eh ,  oh ,  I was and
mm
My cellphone was ringing .  Okay Okay let me answer . 
okay
eh ,  don't hang up on me because we have to talk for twelve minutes . 
yes
The I only went to turn it off . 
Okay ah
And about people I think about movies I love to Watch horror movies
OK
But there are times when the when ,  when I get scared I'm an adult . 
You ,  you scare yourself , 
I get scared and I go find out horror movies . 
okay okay But your responsibility is to watch it ,  and you yourself scare yourself . 
yes That's why That's why I respect what my son told me that time ,  Fifty percent is responsibility , 
Yes
of ,  of the individual ,  of the person ,  eh ,  you already did the best you could ,  but then comes the time for the young people of the past to be eighteen at the . 
that some are much more mature than normal
yes
And they starts seeing R rated movies
mmm
at around fourteen and fifteen years old and the PG thirteen the kids that are eleven and twelve years old are already seeing them . 
already thirteen already
 PG thirteen ,  PG fourteen and then I say ,  that Jenny doesn't like it because she gets scared . 
Yes
But I am in accordance ,  that the major part is ,  the criteria that you form and that way in the end .  take care of them and not let them watch television when they are by themselves . 
But imagine the same we can't control them . 
You have to have a formulated criteria to go and see some movies . 
yes and that's why I'm telling you that you don't get nothing out in telling them ,  you can't see that ,  no .  Because there will come a time in which they go to the house like I say to a friends house . 
They show them documentals
But what I fear the most is when it goes to friend's houses .  And the have the television right there ,  that's used a lot ,  or the computer ,  or whatever
Maybe they are watching something non adequate .  That's why I say ,  I mean ,  if my son or daughter or whoever
Keep going like the superman kid that went up to the window and kill himself
my ,  of course ,  because you know they are not ready for that
It wanted to fly .  No ,  I don't want to aks you a question
aha
eh ,  did you read the rules for this game ,  the telephone game
yes ,  OK
yes ,  yes ,  yes I'm getting ready ,  buying the presnets for the family .  But now I have ,  I have another things in my mind
of course about your birthday no
yes but ,  I'm getting ready ,  buying presents for all the famliy ,  at least for the nieces .  I have them ready ,  we've bought you the presents ,  then there is only the adults left
Buy things for the adults ,  an antencion ,  although I'll make most of the presents
That's what I was going to tell you
I'm going to cook ,  yes ,  ah
cooking and sewing .  Sewing that thing that you did ,  you gave that to me . 
yes ,  the ,  the ,  yes also ,  but I donÂ´t have time yet to wait until middle of ,  until the middle week of December to do it . 
That is beautiful . 
Two days before Miranda . 
ItÂ´s AndreitaÂ´s birthday ,  too .  Or ,  three
Oh ,  now I remember it was about three days . 
For him I will  a screen like those that you draw and then you erase . 
Oh itÂ´s nice
Because she likes ,  she already knew them and she likes them ,  she makes little dashes and then she erases them and ,  IÂ´m not going to give them to her yet because they are very small and she puts them in the mouth . 
But the screen and the pencil yes ,  I will . 
what a feeling . 
And do you know who else's birthday . 
Okay who
The same date
Until I remember when I was there
My father in law ,  that
Your father in law ,  yes
the ,  the ,  Juan Luis Sandra's younger son . 
Oh yes Okay
Also the twenty nine .  I also remember ,  that more or less in the same date ,  I remember that everybody were there in the same date
I don't remember that he was in at least I did not know . 
I have not gone to any birthday in Sandra's house .  I was to one pure ,  I don't remember ,  really . 
yes ,  for her nephew who came later
Of course he came ,  yes ,  he told me that he received it afterwards from her .  But his name no , 
No but Sandra won't throw a party this year for her birthday
no no ,  okay
No ,  she said that family only ,  because they will buy something better for the kid ,  so
yes ,  it's true
She makes really big parties ,  so
it gets away from her hands ,  yes
She spends too much in that ,  and that's why they cannot buy the kid whats he , 
What he really wants ,  yes exactly
they have to decide between the two things ,  so this year they decided that only the family
So he could get a more special present
Of course ,  for a better gift
The smaller of all
Oh yeah . 
And he always says that he doesn . t want any clothes
Oh poor boy . 
I am in the State of Washington , Seattle
wow ,  I am in Los Angeles . 
Ah yes , 
yes it is just incredible
yes
Right now I was making a call and suddenly and I did not think today is Sunday I was half sleep more then awake and I Oh my God . 
Yes this is I believe my twenty third call . 
wow it is almost ready ,  me well just half almost to the tenth . 
yes and this is the second time I do this service with them . 
yes
yes I are
rather yeah tell me
not too "conventional"
aha
Yes because there are lots of movies so ,  I have noticed
yes
yes I like a ,  around here where I live there uste to be one of those ah like Hollywood Video or Blockbuster but it was like
smaller
OK
and they had movies like the ones they're talking about ,  documentaries and stuff ,  but they had to close because since the big stores are around ,  people won't go to these places
Sure
but those are the best ones ,  I can find movies I like ,  yes ,  my husband is from America ,  but he likes international movies too ,  movies that have more
more important things to say
Exactly ,  exactly
From time to time ,  since I have young children ,  sometimes they want to see some movies and we take them ,  but usually no ,  we have .  Before ,  we used to go to the movies two or three times a month
No ,  no ,  no .  And then we started getting information about other kind of movies ,  and well ,  we changed completely to that kind of movie .  Actually  , right now we are in
a different content ,  that's worth watching ,  but lately I feel they're making movies just for the sake of making them
yeah ,  exactly
it's like ,  well ,  he have to make 10 movies .  We'll make then movies ,  it doesn't matter how ,  or when ,  just
with the means of communication we are like this , yes yes . 
I believe aja . 
because every time you see something or they put on something really stupid
exactly
Or the do or they exagerate a lot
Exactly . 
when we went out did you know he was American . 
of course
and suddenly ,  we got home and we turned the TV on ,  and there were a bunch of stuff going on at Pananama ,  and i looked at him
Exactly . 
and the next day it was the same ,  and i say ,  Â¡oh what an ex agent .  ,  I think they where showing the things that happened last week and exaggerating like that ,  Â¿what
the news ,  none of that .  that's what i tell my kids ,  don't believe everything the TV says . 
Right
That's just when Noriega's problem and everything else we were watching the whole documentary ,  and i was like ,  it's cold ,  because i would never had imagined that it was so sad and so
so ugly what happened
That was the documentary where they spoke about that men that got his head cut off
and ,  oh yeah
It isn't ,  it isn't remembered
You know ,  i can't remember exactly ,  i don't remember but .  .  .  what i can remember is that night ,  when they bombed and a lot of people died ,  uh ,  even so ,  a few days ago they showed a
aha ,  but in that place you say ,  almost happens the same in Venezuela with the current President .  There are happening things that you know are happening to us . 
Univision .  That donÂ´t be so shameless ,  that donÂ´t put those things there ,  that was not the reality ,  the first thing people tell you ,  eh .  And that President
yes that
and and ah well ,  I donÂ´t know if you have heard him
no ,  no because as I tell you ,  I donÂ´t get to much in that news stuff ,  sometimes
of course ,  of course ,  look there is a page on the internet where you can watch television from all the countries including Panama ,  of course it is called
TV four all ,  like TV four all
TV
four all
Yes ,  Theater
Four is a number four
aha
  TV number four all
TV or Tv for all
exactly ,  exactly there you go
with
it is dot com yes
OK
there you see the programming of all the channels all the chanels of the world and then of ocurse Panama and Venezuela .   And then now I ,  now I see the Venezuelan television . 
but I like to watch to see what horrific things they are saying . 
the whole world ,  a bit like for comparing ,  what is going on and even we are doing it with radio ,  we're listening to community radio ,  that you feel like you ar 
are saying truly the truth or at least the other side of the coin ,  let's not say it's the truth a hundred per cent because sometimes it's not
I mean ,  it's like I don't know ,  it's not that you can say that that everything the others say is not but
aha
Good heavens .  truly they manipulate it too much . 
It's a documentary about those who work in Fox News
mhm
and well the practically force them to say what it's not and then they decided to resign from the channel and besides resigning they all got together and the started to protest at a level
well ,  at the level of ,  of ,  eh ,  locally to tell the world what was going on inside Fox News .  It's very interesting ,  it's called something like
Washington DC
yes ,  Washington State
Oh ,  and the other one
I'm talking from Idaho ,  i don't know if you know it
Yes ,  of course
Yes ,  well ,  personally I don't believe that much about the movies ratings .  For my point of view ,  the ratings don't go the way i suppose they would be
they don't know how to rate them .  For example ,  sometimes they said that it is a PG movie ,  but when you watch it ,  and it really
has rude things ,  and pornography ,  and sometimes something stronger like a PG 13 is more quiet
and doesn't have that many nude scenes or bad language .  Personally ,  I don't care about those ratings ,  sometimes it just
Yes ,  i really don't know that much about movies ,  because
Aha
let's say ,  I don't have children or anything like that ,  so I barely ever notice
Aha
what ,  what classification
Aha
But I think that the majority of TV there is ,  let's say if you watch during the middle of the day that is when many times children are at home
Aha
are things that are not appropriate for most
yes
yes
many things already are like normal that that I think that they should not be
yes ,  yes it is true because ,  uhm ,  and it is true because uhm ,  oe time ,  well I don't have cable have ,  the regular channels ,  the ones one can watch
Aha
to be well choosing the program I am going to see for that whi  for that time
Hmjm
and sometimes they air movies that ,  boy ,  yes a ten or nine year old boy was at home and was watching the ,  was changing it too at the same time that I and
stop on that channel ,  there were things like very ,  like very for adults already
Sure
Then I said ,  uf ,  I said I thought about the children ,  I said ,  well ,  I ,  I am married ,  I have been married three years and I have a ,  a boy who is almost two years old . 
OK
In any case my son is going to grow up and maybe this is going to get worse .   Then
of course and 
imagine then what kind of cartoons they are going to  well I remember that once I was watching television .   Look ,  in Mexico ,  I am from Mexico City
to the channel that here is sixteen ,  then there was a cartoon in English .   Because at night they show some in English ,  some in Spanish
Well ,  well the cartoons started to show up naked
ah
and the cartoon was starting to do things the two cartoon figures .   And it was a cartoon ,  imagine ,  and it was ten at night ,  my mom told me
what a horror
she turned the television off and well she had to explain a bit because well my mom she ,  it didn't ,  it surprised her because I had tuned to a cartoon channel a normal channel . 
Then ,  OK the truth ,  not even cartoons are safe . 
Sometimes cartoons yes
And you cannot either be on top of let's say if the kid changes you cannot jump to see or whatever ,  you have to trust that ,  that let's say ,  at least during the day
yes
programming does not contain nudity or curse words or anything like that . 
uh ,  tru  ,  in CablevisiÃ³n and MultivisiÃ³n ,  that would be what cable here to  uh ,  there in MÃ©xico ,  it hasn't all those restrictions .  But ,  for example ,  in normal tv's ,  with normal channels
Yes ,  it has like more ,  more restrictions .  Uh ,  not so much now on the other cables .  and ,  for example ,  In ,  in tv's ,  for example ,  normal of ch  children's channel
pornography thing or with more nudity . 
Right
And then her kid was watching ,  uh ,  the a cartoon channel and after that the girl wanted to change the channel and ,  uh ,  it was another channel that was also programmed for them ,  for kids . 
Aha ,  but it showed and I went and told her ,  her mom of hers and she told me ah ,  there's no problem ,  it's a channel of
of ,  of cartoons ,  of ,  that they show a lot of programs .  And ,  honestly it was it was ,  it didn't ,  it didn't leave much to the imagination .  I was really like the pose of ,  well it was like an operation room where the woman was having her baby . 
what they want .  But honestly for m  if I don't want to explain too much to my children in that moment ,  well honestly I ,  like ,  keep watch more what , 
they don't leave anything to the mi  to the imagination ,  they show it right away . 
many mo  moms are at home and they have little children three ,  four years old ,  five or more or they're at home and they watch ,  they're watching their soap opera
and they're al  always show scenes where they are the ,  the couple ,  they're there having relations . 
hmm
And in the middle of the day ,  because the soap operas later are on from six in the morning until nightfall . 
no ,  I
So ,  the programs ,  are classified ,  to see a scene of pornography on the television at anytime of the day is normal .  And for many
parents unfortunately are making it normal
exactly
And I believe that that if the parents spoke to this television station and said that or demand that that were more strict programs to ,  to privacies of scenes ,  of this type of scenes
I believe that they would decrease a little .  But anyways ,  not now or  ,  until parents if their children see something like that ,  it's okay ,  it's no problem . 
if a movie has some sex scene or has crudeness for the people they buy it or the people see it and they even s they laugh , 
or sometimes it even calls their attention because it has a very strong scene .  So really ,  these these things sometimes even help more
producers to sell
sometimes ,  and
If that's the case ,  no .  Uh ,  for me in particular ,  the type of movies that I like ,  in truth I really like Disney movies ,  the
yes ,  yes  ,  yes
Even though I ,  I am tired and I love all of this .  I have some Disney movie around here .  Sincerely ,  I do not like the movies
of course ,  of course
yes he/she does not know how they are going to change
no ,  no ,  yes then already ,  this is the truth ,  this is bringing the truth far as it already goes ,  you turn on the television and if you .  .  you already see a commercial . 
put there how she is placing the towel
exactly
but if a boy or a girl is seeing it for example ,  and yoiu say if it is the mom and you can answer ,  well fine ,  and if it is the friend boy or girl
and you tell them ,  and can explain to him/her the bad information ,  then .  .  . 
I see Mariza ,  we talked a few days ago I think ,  no . 
Listen the theme for today is about religion ,  no . 
Ah ,  yes really today in this country .   Eh ,  In the United States there is a lot ,  lot of problems regarding religion ,  it is a mix with politics and lot of right side people that want to have control . 
Hmm ,  yeah
Then they exerted a power very ,  very direct ,  very ,  sure ,  trying to influence people there at the church
Yeah
With the discourse ,  it came to my attention against the public schools
Aham
Directly against the public schools and praying for God to free us from public school some day
Because yes
Oh ,  oh ,  no
And against the theory ,  about trying to see the theory of evolution ,  no
Oh ,  I've heard that ,  yes
Exactly ,  yeah ,  there are a lot of problems ,  yeah
Well ,  I'm getting carried ,  what I say is that ,  reasonably ,  the Bible doesn't make for a explanation of the world
No ,  everyone can believe what they want what it is is that they try to impose their beliefs to everyone and for the Bible ,  for what they think
Exactly ,  they're fundamentalisms ,  no
Yeah ,  fundamentalism ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  from the right wing ,  But also the country is ,  ah ,  the party has the power so ,  everyone from the president to everyone who is into this ,  at the White House ,  they're all rightwing republicans . 
Target of ,  uh ,  Christians and they are the ones that The people with power in the country ,  the ones with the companies ,  everyone is ,  maybe ,  there are a lot of rightwing republican fundamentalists who want to take the law away . 
The right to abort ,  the right of ,  for example another question was ,  homosexuality ,  gay marriage ,  the right to the belief of
yes ,  more scientific ,  no ,  no ,  you can't just believe what they say ,  they say God created man and woman ,  you also have to give a choice for kids to believe , 
that was Charles Darwin who came up with the theory of evolution .  And
But
Well I think that maybe ,  as similar as we are ,  more problems ,  no . 
yes
In that sense ,  the differences help to complement each other . 
Yes I ,  I'm convinced it's that because I know a lot of people that are , 
No
uh ,  well homosexuals ,  or lesbians and ,  I'm really informed and so that's why yea I never know because .  Ever since I was ,  since I was a girl ,  well , 
yes
They have to have the right to get married ,  to live with whoever . 
yes yes I agree with you ,  exactly I think that ,  they have all the rights ,  because we can have any other type of person and in this cases the marriage rights are relatives
well many drive the homosexuality question as a very wicked situation and they don't have rights to marriage ,  no really when marriage is really a contract
mhm
between two persons that stated doing something in comun . 
No , 
believe that it is an abomination because marriage is define as the union between a woman & a man and believe ,  and the ,  people & christian fundamentalist like I said before they see it as an abomination ,  and they are so closed mind that they don't understand that
that was before ,  the tradicional thinking but now times have change and each one also .   Same as before ,  homosexuality has been always ,  since the beginning of man but before was a way and now is  , 
aha
People is accepting the echo from people ,  yes like he is homosexual ,  yes and well
right ,  yes like there is one that is so exreme ,  eh ,  the family and marrige ,  the eclesiastic institution and the blessing of God for marriage and things when in reality
well the church and religion is a way of institution ,  like school ,  have
right . 
the need to change and find new ways to learn thing of life . 
yes ,  the religion has to be something personal ,  no something that mix with politics ,  each one can ,  the ,  think ,  what you believe is each one ,  doesn't have to be what , 
eh ,  let's see why you don't think the same as me ,  you are no me ,  well ,  like you get punish because we are diffent ,  and shouldn't be that ,  each person can think whatever they want ,  believe in anything or anyone ,  don't have , 
for the christians ,  because they talk badly about the Muslims because they say they are radicals or they talk badly about ,  the atheist because they don't believein god and they call them  heretic or  , 
But I don't know
right
That is very christian ,  you have to accept the people like they are ,  and each and everyone one of them that believes or has your religion ,  but that is the problem with the fundamentalists ,  that they don't accept the differences . 
you know they are very ,  radicals ,  no ,  they don't accept differences because they were raised in a manner that their parents taught them ,  so
yes
and for example ,  I had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of different races ,  cultures ,  so I am very open to everything . 
But is that there are classes there are mu  people of different classes ,  and well ,  there has to be radicals Christians there has to be everything ,  but I think that yes ,  religion does influence the country ,  yes . 
saying how to do things in the country and that's why there is such a polemic with marriages also there is with the ,  with the supreme court with ,  with ,  the judges that they want them to be from the right also and that they are religious well ,  they
to be or Catholic or that they are also they want that ,  that they take away the right to abortion and things like that ,  that is ,  is ridiculous at this stage of the century . 
But ,  that's how we are now . 
I in my family are from ,  in Spain I'm Cat  Catholicism let's say it's as soon as you're born they baptize you ,  first communion and all that ,  so I got married in the Church
Sure . 
yes
But ,  Let's say faith ,  it is each one ,  I don't know that each person is free to believe what he wants ,  and practice it ,  but respecting others who are not the same . 
aha
Because there are many religions and what happens is that the Christian religion is the most let's say abundant in the world ,  it is the more ,  the one that has the power on everything
Because in the world we have ,  on this side of the world no ,  because I believe that I only believe that not even the majority of Christians ,  I believe there are more Muslims than Christians . 
Yes but they don't have as much economic power ,  that is the problem . 
Hi ,  good night . 
Good night .  My name is Carolina .

Ok ,  right and
Don't know ,  you heard that
yeas ,  yes i did ,  and i think that they will start another one after they finish this one . 
No ,  i don't know ,  most probably they do ,  because i ,  i already did two . 
Mhm
On in English and another in Spanish
yes ,  and what we're doing right now is technology
Oh ,  oh . 
because they are doing phone line connections
and this is technology yes ,  something like that ,  was the same thing ,   but in English
Yeah they paid the same
Oh ,  ok ,  OK
Yes ,  I like to do this not only for the payment ,  but for the opportunity given to me . 
Ah ,  good . 
to speak in Spanish
Of course . 
Mm ,  yes . 
Yes . 
And what
Goo  Yes ,  of course it is . 
because they are using multiple telephone lines to connect many people living in different parts of the country . 
ah ,  a monthly fee
Yeah . 
Oh ,  but here in
And that wasn't ,  that wasn't like that in five or ten ,  twenty years . 
Here in the United States ,  yes
Oh ya ,  ofcourse ,  yes ,  yes ,  justifiably I have just received ah ,  from Verizon that they are offering me free calls here in the United States
yes . 
if they charge you something monthly ,  but if you make a lot of calls ,  it's worthwhile . 
Ah ,  how good it was . 
You pay a monthly quote and you can make the calls you want . 
yes . 
Now you can talk three four or five hours for five dollars . 
Before it was one minute ,  oh my god it was like eight
One minute was twenty cents ,  yes
And yes ,  I remember that I had to talk ,  I think that just ten minutes was ,  it cost me like twenty five dollars . 
yes ,  yes ,  yes that has happened to me too
yes ,  aha
that yes ,  yes ,  yes ,  ah ,  I know that yes ,  what it is ,  you have to be with the clock
Aha .  Of course .   Ah ,  yes
What happens is that like it is advancing and technology is in the hands of ,  of more people
Mmh .  Mmh
then services are cheaper ,  because they sell to more people
Na  Sure ,  yes
mhm ,  of course . 
eh ,  for example ,  the computer ,  the computer a few years ago was worth one or two thousand dollars . 
of course ,  of course ,  ha
because technology has adavanced .

A  yes ,  yes ,  yes . 
Or ,  or heart disease as well . 
AIDS is more advanced than cancer ,  in ,  in
Well ,  that's if . 
in the sense of control because you have to have the drugs to fight it . 
But the cancer is very slow I think . 
No ,  no ,  no it's not true . 
I nothing .  Nothing . 
yes
that could be improved
Well ,  well
yes . 
yes ,  yes , 
It can happen to any person
I ,  I had a friend that died very young ,  at thirty two years of age ,  and got cancer from one day to another . 
yes ,  because she got  cerebral bleeding
