And this young man heard that ,  that you live in the US ?  have you lived there all your life ? 
And now you are married with ,  is with Latin ,  or with an American ? 
sure ,  yes ,  it should be a lot more difficult ,  but ,  well I believe ,  well in the long term it is going to be very good also ,  no ?  that way you grow up with two languages and that is a strenght
Then you have ,  have taught even in high school or what  ? 
I imagine that you must have studied something like about Education or something like that no ? 
or what did you study ? 
Hi eh ,  Today's topic is frankly touching huh ? 
Exactly ,  now I said ,  well it's going to be the memories ,  I said well ,  the memories are like precisely the most important thing that life can bring you ,  because one lives ,  like ,  of memories ,  right ? 
marvelous things and maybe only one can't be selected true ? 
Uh um ,  your husband ,  you met him ¿where ? 
But ,  but it's nice ,  it's really nice ,  and then ,  ¿what's the best that has happened to you ,  your best memory ? 
where do you live ? 
yes but she will do it for sure .  What did you study ? 
Well my name is Claudia Ivette .   With whom do I have the pleasure ? 
my pleasure as well .   Where are you ? 
From where ,  what ? 
this is a place called Robert this .   And you where are you speaking from ? 
because if you say no ,  turn around ,  no ,  no ,  you must not see that ,  then a teenager or a kid will start thinking ,  ah ,  but why won't mom let me see that ? 
What's your name ? 
Joe ? 
yes ,  and what's your name ? 
Alex .  where are you from ? 
Where are you from again ? 
Well ,  and what do you think about tonight's topic ? 
obvious right ?   But ehm I think that the   R or ,  those days it is very stretched what is allowed or not .   Ehm ,  ehm ,  I agree that
many movies ,  right ?  that don't make any sense for example ,  there are many movies about gang members that that the gang members many gang members are the ones that go to see it because since
the society ,  the parents ,  the family has a lot to do in helping the children to understand those things and and how to  send them ,  right ?   And I with my daughter ,  I do not ,  when
Do you have teenagers ? 
and if he goes and have sex with this girl ,  well this are the consequences ,  this can happen to you ,  do you understand ? 
Well ,  i was thinking ,  dear mother ,  ¿how can it be ?  ,  hey ,  we got a very difficult subject today
¿Where are you from ? 
They twist the facts about what's happening and then I always find po  with people that ,  for example ,  tell me good heavens .  and what do you think about the mad man that you have for president ?  and
wanted to tell you was that ,  after they've said a bunch of outrageous stuff ,  no ? 
When you try to say something to the other person ,  look things are like this ,  don't you see ?  Then they say no ,  because you are
Right ,  that what they say to me sometimes ,  What are you doing here ? 
In ,  uh ,  at any given time ,  but that has nothing to do with the opposition ,  because ,  for example ,  ¿how many Venezuelan people don't live in Venezuela ?  ,  and what they're doing it's bashing
Because ,  ¿why are you here ?  ,  and well ,  maybe you would do the same ,  thank god that you're here ,  not in Venezuela . 
outstandingly high ,  that people cannot ,  uh ,  they don't protest ,  i say ,  oh my god ,  but ¿what's wrong with these people ?  ,  i mean
How ever ,  i tell you ,  i don't know ,  suddenly here .  ¿are you in ,  in Pennsylvania you told me ? 
Me too ,  me at first that there wasn't I didn't have access to that ,  that website I said ,  My god ,  is it true about they are saying about venezuela ?  but I talked with my friends
And they said ,  no girl  ,  what is that ?  Look ,  jeez seriously ,  but look the power of TV is
Of course ,  of course ,  and what are you doing there in Philadelphia ? 
Oh ,  and you think is better than Miami ? 
And wath we shall do ?  Job is first . 
Of course ,  of course ,  and we went here .  How are you ? 
But ,  how long you're in the United States ? 
Twelve ? 
Then ,  before I also see to Americans like the gringos ,  now I understand that no ,  they are americans that are from USA ,  because that is another wrong concept that is handles ¿isn't ?  then , 
why ?  Why ? 
Well my name is Ibet ,  with whom do I have the pleasure ? 
Hello Mercedes , how are you ?  Where are you from Mercedes ? 
Oh from Honduras ? 
Ah .  from where ? 
And you where are you from ? 
Ah .  from where  ?  The City eh , Capitol
What do you think of today's topic ?  That it is easier to break up with someone young or do age make a difference . 
And was there a time when you had a break up that was difficult ? 
eh I'm going to have three children I was placing my castles in the sky and when he came and said you know what ?  here no .  here it ends . 
What ? 
How great .  The best .  But for what ?  If you have trouble ,  you get trouble . 
And what about you ? 
Yes ,  and what's happening with you ? 
You are married now ? 
Uh .  What else ?  Let's see what else .  After that I didn't have any other official boyfriend until S  ,  more than ,  yes ,  truly the experiences that I never had in some manne  experience like I don't even know ,  right ?  Thank God . 
I think that it has to be the worst experience ,  I think ,  of your life it's ,  yes ,  and I hope ,  I hope it never happens because we don't know ,  right ? 
It's impossible then that they maintain a right ?  A situation that way of that ay , 
Yes ,  one always loves the person but it's impossible that it's only is peace ,  then that is what I'm saying ,  right ? 
Because one ,  well I ,  I am one ,  a human and one has to ,  things that very bother other people .  You know ?  And
yes ,  the truth  ,  I think that it is something of the truth ,  it is very difficult to maintain the appearance  that everything is happy fine ,  you know ?  but
that ,  really ,  you won't know her very depths ,  you know ?  until you are married to that person but that but that I think that I think that
the drama is ,  well ,  a lot ,  right ?  so then the people don't know how to go out and move on ,  right ?  that happens . 
And i told he ,  ¿what's with the glasses ?  ,  it was ,  well the day was cloudy ,  ¿right ?  ,  and she had a bruise because her boyfriend hit her . 
your boyfriend ,  because .  and she said ,  "well ,  it's just that ,  it very ,  it's very hard to me to break up with him" .  And told her ,  "¿Why ? " ,  and she said
And then ,  wow ,  i told her ,  ¿What ?  ,  ¿How can you possible love someone that hits you ,  that hurts you ?  .  sometimes she came ,  uh ,  bruised ,  or sometimes
How is it going ,  Fabiola ?  How are you ?  Mm . 
Well .   And you ? 
Well ,  well .   Where are you ? 
In Washington ?  yes . 
And you ? 
We are in the extremes exactly .   how great .   And where are you from ? 
From Maracaibo ? 
No ,  you know ,  know .   Why ,  do you know people from there ? 
Oh ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  Well ,  you know that they have a very strong accent No ?  Something like ,  look and you .  MN . 
look and you Are you arepa ? 
Mhm Oh Do you work at the Hilton ? 
Do you work ? 
Ah ,  ok ,  ok .  Chilean ,  of course .  no ? 
Yes ,  Yes ,  Yes .  Now im ,  is in the oral part .  No ?  I'm in the other side of ,  of ,  Mm ,  of the ,  mm
and ?  talk ? 
But ,  definitively they are going to have that option ,  well .   That even in ,  eh ,  it is/ there are some parents who combine ,  sign language with the oral part .   No ?   Depending on , 
and what do you think about ,  about the subject they gave us today about  ? 
eh ,  sometimes it is a little difficult .   No ?  But ,  I think that love is the only thing that makes it possible to overcome barriers ,  nothing else . 
they can overcome ,  what do you think ? 
And ,  twelve ,  imagine that .  And ,  and we really have had ,  well ,  two critical moments ,  almost splitting .  And ,  and ,  there was a point where also maturity plays an important role there ,  ¿right ? 
ah ,  that is what I say ,  if I fall ,  I stand up again .  What is the problem ? 
Right ?  whatever ,  exactly .  Then ,  fortunately ,  well ,  eh ,  the first time it was horrible ,  because I thought it was the end of the world .  And ,  then we were for a long time without talking to each other until a day ,  I say ,  well ,  What is going on ? 
Hm ,  horrible ,  horrible ,  horrible .  I told him ,  look ,  You know what ?  it looks to me , 
hear me ,  not ,  terrible ,  a big tantrum on our part ,  really .  I told him Do you know ?  this looks to me like a big tantrum on our part . 
Let's get going .  Because ,  putting aside how serious the situation might be ,  it   fortnately it wasn't too serious ,  but ,  uh ,  seeing as neither of them wanted to twist anyone's arm ,  right ? 
Because   what are we going to do with a mediocre relationship ?  I don't want a mediocre rlationship .  As you yourself say ,  there are people who spent up to 30 years together ,  and that's a nasty relationship . 
Really ? 
It's that they treat each other badly .  This ,  look here ,  this piece of whatchamacallit ,  what   what is that ?  What do I want that for ? 
No ?  There is respect .  and , 
No ?  There are some that mention love .  If there is no love there is nothing . 
Of course .  Is your husband from Chile too ? 
You think it's easier ? 
And ,  that ,  that's what I said ? 
what did you say ?  Or when we are super b 
Hello ,  hello ,  how are you ? 
Oh ,  how are you ? 
Fine ,  and you ? 
that's good ,  where are you from originally ? 
really ?  Me too . 
Really ? 
How long have you been living here ? 
and what is it called ,  and of course then would come and go but more less the ninety one ,  yes .   And you ? 
And and you ,  where are you from ? 
From Santiago as well ? 
And have you been here long in this thing ?   Of calling over the phone ? 
oh really ? 
Hello ? 
Ah ,  you're uh ,  you're calling every day ? 
Yes ,  yes ,  and what can we do if that happens ? 
I thought ,  i thought that it was like this ,  this study ,  to do ,  ¿what's it called ?  ,  telephone menu's and stuff like that . 
Oh ,  ¿because you shouldn't or because you don't want to ? 
Right .  and do you like it here ? 
Oh ,  and why ? 
yes ,  okay .  But ,  do you have to drive your car a lot or do you use public transportation ? 
and they treat me to speak in Arabic ,  I don't know .  They found me the face most of the Indian or something loke that but sure ,  ¿and there are discrimitation or not ? 
and how did you get there ? 
yeah ,  i married an american ,  that's how i got here ,  what about you ? 
oh really ? 
So then ,  you are single now ? 
okay ,  ah look ,  and and ,  what do you call it ,  do you like it or not ? 
Hi .  How are you ?  Mi name is Juan .  Marcela . 
yes ,  how are you ? 
I have not forgotten .  We practiced together ,  no ?  Yes .  Listen ,  But I am ,  it's time ,  health . 
Do you have social security here ?  Are you covered ? 
Is a problem right ? 
We are not covered .  Is a problem because ,  well something could always happen ,  right ? 
people in the community ,  right ? 
they denied that to you ,  medical attention ? 
no ?  yes ,  he gave me some .  So ,  yes ,  it's something that we think should be more flexible ,  right ,  for the community ,  for a certain type of community
because of the demand and because people keep paying those prices ,  so costs go up because people ask for more and more money .  And then ,  people need more money ,  it's a vicious cycle .  So ,  how could they possibly create a more social medicine ? 
Exactly .   It's a problem ,  it's a cycle that works with earnings and it is stronger ,  right ? 
With that .  Because here ,  I don't know what it is like where you live .   But here ,  if anyone has money it's the nurses and the doctors .  Right ? 
So .  Mm .  And here ,  well like you say ,  you see a good car with a woman who is thirty years old ,  for example ,  no ? 
Yes ,  yes I uh uh .  Well here in this case well that is what is offered .  In Canada ,  I understand ,  well ,  they have a lot of medicine ,  right ? 
is expensive ,  no ?  And then I don't know how the medicines here are ,  in Mexico they are cheaper and is more like that
No ?  yes .  yes .  And here there's only one .  And second that in literature she's not the best .  And it is hey but only the laboratories ,  I thought that all of the North American laboratories well uh
Super strong interests in everything ,  no ? 
According to the specialty they have to operate over here .  Do you know what you would have to do ? 
Why don't you contact an organization that is called the Shriners ? 
yes I knew about that .  Listen ,  is our time up or what ? 
with the epilepsy ,  no ? 
no ?  After you know that always you are hoping that it doesn't happen .  Well ,  I don't know what what happens really no But then that trauma but to my poor son because he's a teenager then
Of course because on top of it it's embarrassing .   Look ,  how old is he ? 
Yes ,  yes ,  it's a stigma .   It's a stigma .   What he has ,  no ?  so
How old is he ? 
Yes .   Also do you you know where you can find out ?  In teaching hospitals
go to people that don't ,  can't pay in the situation as one usually would ,  you see ?  Like we how can't go to a specialist because it costs a lot of money . 
Ah ,  Yea ? 
With the university Ah ? 
Mm .  Uh uh .  Therefore ,  they told me I needed to bring them information .  I had a letter from my admissions ,  etc ,  no ? 
No ?  Well I don't .  But ,  well now I have my own social security ,  my own . 
Hello ,  how are you ?  Mi name is Juan
yes ,  how have you been ? 
listen ,  fine everything is fine ,  what do you think about today's topic ? 
no ,  I did not listen to it ,  what is the topic ? 
and you consider the tecnology ,  no ?  your daily life ,  if it turns out to be more a problem than a solution or something like that . 
does that include automobile ,  cars ? 
is the same that ,  is the same that I was thinking ,  of course ,  it should be included ,  no ? 
yes because is a ,  you know ?  a machine
exactly ,  yes ,  but ,  I said well yes ,  the automobile seems to be the most important ,  no ?  is then I thought maybe is the computer ,  but no
aha ,  exactly but sometimes ,  eh ,  what seems like a more personal element depending on the case ,  then it can be the car ,  no ?  because the computer is now every time more just another tool
then more than ,  than ,  sometimes ,  lets say that it is part of the institution where you are found ,  no ?  is more like a working tool
but a very personal tool seems to the car ,  no ? 
because you have to take care of the car and you know ? 
did you use horses more ? 
no ?  it is like a horse ,  it is something very personal very close
eh what allows communications and all that no ? 
you all need a car you know ?  to work
exactly and here the working people have ,  like in those times a like a mule no ?  need a pick up a truck pick up
pick up truck , no ?  and go and give ,  and for it not to leave yoy ,  then it is you can tell like there is a culture for hard work very important
and the computers ,  good ,  well all the houses there is television ,  telephone and computers practically ,  no ?  but ,  but how are there other dimensions no ?  of the technological question ,  then the auto appears to be
ah ,  what what tecnological question ,  is technology important in your life ?  what is that we are discussing right now if it had to be the auto or if it had to be the computer ?  what you do you opine ? 
because you know ?  because i have my cellphone and I am always with it
and ,  well I have become used to having a cellphone ,  you know ? 
I'm always returning to my house for ,  for ,  you know ?  see my messages
yes ,  I notice that ,  it is very important what you just said ,  some time ago ,  when I worked I had the type of job in which the computer was the most important ,  no ? 
and well ,  the computer had the messages ,  it always had internet ,  e mail messaging more than the cellphone ,  no cellphone nothing ,  no ? 
more physical right ?  ,  then the care becomes the most important instrument ,  and the computer ,  well ,  it goes to a second instance ,  but it is also important ,  right ? 
is more a problem that a help ,  but obviously ,  you know ?  ,  obviously
oh really ? 
But also in the city ,  I think ,  and the most import .  .  .  ,  well ,  according to the job ,  it might be the computer ,  right ?  then
the other question ,  the communication electronics ,  right ?  ,  the cellphone and
we .  .  what type of problems can you have ,  no ?  as you just said ,  with the car ,  the problems that have to do with parking
no ?  here in Texas no ,  there is not ,  where I am there are not many problems ,  no ?  with parking there is a lot of space everywhere ,  no ,  it hasn't presented yet
of transportation ,  no ?  for example
aha ,  but ,  don't you think that also ,  it is like wonderful that that it has changed in like sixty years ? 
charged the development costs ,  you understand ?  I don't know how to explain it well but
exactly yes ,  but as they also say ,  with the car industry ,  no ?  if the car industry had advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry perhaps cars could transport us with
no ?  and instead of costing twenty thousand dollars ,  they would be costing two thousand dollars
If that's the case ,  no ?  but technology ,  that industry at best ,   has its own interests and it's as if it doesn't advance no ?  you heard what they are saying about the hybrids
no ?  no I don't think they have a real real ,  that they it is really an important change in technology given its efficency
Pardon me ? 
no ,  no I don't think it is so important at the same time the efficiency they show es radically different than that of other cars it is too little .  no ?  you see that's what I say
yes ,  that's right ,  sure ,  but at the same time ,  for example ,  these cars ,  the small cars ,  they have the same performance as the hybrid cars ,  and they are not hybrids ,  no ? 
and smaller ,  isn't it ?  So ,  if we buy a car at the price of a hybrid car and we compare it against a small European car or to one of those cars of Latin American ,  well
it's cheaper that a normal car ,  a good economical car ,  right ? 
and ,  why is that ? 
why are the United States one of the only countries to have this ,  why do we have this huge cars ,  you know ? 
How are you ? 
Well ,  and you ?  How is the weather our there in you home ? 
Because we are ugly ,  we are cold .  How are the movies ?  Had we already spoken about this issue ? 
Is because you let him and thought that is okay .  Isn't that right  ? 
That's why I'm telling you ,  you can control them ,  "you can't watch this movie because this and this reason ,  because you're not mature enough" or whatever you want to tell them ,  ¿right ? 
eh ,  did you read the rules to the game on the telephone ? 
I was asking myself ,  ah ,  how is this ?  are you already preparing for Christmas ? 
¿And what what did you buy to Miranda ? 
No ,  ¿who ? 
¿Who ? 
Yeah ,  that's true ,  ¿who ? 
Tamara ,  how are you ? 
yea ,  and you ? 
good good ,  where are you ? 
yeah ,  yeah you got me out of base ,  but do you have time participating in this ? 
Did you get the same email ?  right ? It will apparently continue ,  that's what i understood in the email i received . 
So what you think of about what they put in the movies ? 
Watch movies that are in uh ,  what do you call this ?  ,  Lost festivals ,  here is an example the recently completed International Latin American Film Festival
pid ,  so dumb that i felt annoyed to be there ,  and well ,  what are we doing here ?  ,  why I'm wasting my time ? 
What are we doing ?  I mean ,  I prefer going to sleep that to watch those thins ,  but there are movies that have
Yes ,  it's like ,  "Well ,  we have to make 10 movies ,  let's make them ,  how ?  ,  when ?  ,  it doesn't matter"
As they role as we said .  Where are you from ? 
We say like this ,  "a lo Macho" ,  ¿right ?  ,  like ,  well ,  yeah make movies ,  whatever ,  but yeah there are some good and others ,  well ,  they're not but
but then they repeated it ,  and repeated it ,  and repated it .  ¡Oh my God .  ,  ¿What's this ?  ,  we're paying for this ,  so it's like a annoying ,  we're annoyed with
Hey weren't you and I by there this morning ?  I don't remember looking nothing like that there .
