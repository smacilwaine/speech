lots of movies, right? They don't have a sense of, many of them are about gangs, about lots of gangs or gang members, and they go to watch them because it's like
society, the parents, families, they have a lot to do with it, they should help the children understand what those things are and how to avoid them, right? I talk to my girl and I don't, when
Do you have teenagers?
if he wants to do that if he wants to have sex with a girl these are the consequences that that he might get-, what might happen, you understand?
Ay, I was thinking, my god, how can it be? Hey, today we got a very difficult subject
Where are you from?
they twist what is happening and then always I find myself with people who, for example, tell me damn, what do you think of the crazy man you have as a president? and
I wanted to say, that, so later they have said a few stupid things, no?
and you try to tell the other person, look it's like this, like this.. don't you realize?  And then they tell you no, because you are
Exactly, that is what they tell me sometimes, "what are you doing here?
because, what do you do over here ? all right, could be same as you, thank God. You being here, and not in Venezuela
for really unusual high price, the people can't cope with that, they don't protest either, and i say, my God, what's happening with all those people?, like
however i tell you,  don't know, suddenly here, you live in Pennsylvania like you told me, right ?
me too, at the beginning there wasn't I didn't have access to that, to that page I said, My Good, could it be true what they are saying about Venezuela? But I talked with my friends
and they said, no, girl, what is that? Look, and I, damn really, but look the power of television is
Of course, of course, what do you do there in Philadelphia?
Oh, and do you think it is best over there than in Miami?

Of course, of course, and fi- and come over here  And what do you do?
But, and do you have much time here in the United States?
Twelve?
Then, I also before saw the Americans like gringos, then this one, now i understand that don't, that they are Americans and united states, because that is another wrong concept they manage, no ? Then,

Hello Mercedes, How are you? Where are you from Mercedes?

yes?
eh, I'm going to have 3 kids and building castles in the air and when he came once and told me, you know what? here we are over
what?
That´s good. It´s better.What for? Trouble, to get in trouble
And you?
yes, and how does that happened to you?
Are you married now?
Eh, What else? Let's see which other one. After that I didn't have any other formal boyfriend until S- yes, the truth is I never had any bad experiences I don't know, really? Thank God.
I think that must be one of the worse, I think, experiences, yes, I hope, I hope I never have to go through that cause we don't know, right?
it's impossible to have a perfect relationship, right? A situation in which
yes, one loves the person but it's impossible to be at peace all the time, that's what I mean, right?
Because one, then I, I am one, is a human being and one has to, things that bother to other people, right? and
yes, the truth I fe-, I think it has to be some truth, eh it's difficult eh, keep all happy, right? but
that, of course, you don't fully know, right? until you get married with that person but I think that I think
the drama is al-eh lots really? and then the people don't know how to get out the cycle of ,of abuse is what happens
And i told her, now your wearing glasses? and she had a black eye because her boyfriend hit her.
and then i said wow, what? how can you love a person that hits you? she sometimes came with bruises or sometimes
What's up Fabiola?, How are you?

Ah, OK, OK. Chilean, of course, no?
yes, yes, yes. Now I'm- it's important orally. No? I'm like in the mid- at the other extreme of the of, of, mm, of the, mm,
And ho-? To speak?
But, definetively they'll have that option, then. And even, eh, there are paretns that combine, the signal language with the oral part, No? depending on
What do you think about, about the subject they gave us of the-?
eh, sometimes is a little bit difficult, no? But, I think love is the only thing that can make overcome these barriers, nothing else
are overcome, what do you think?
and twelve, imagine that, i mean we've had critical moments but, never enough to separate, and there's a time where maturity plays a big role, right?
As I say, if I fall down, i just put myself up, What's the problem?
Exactly, the luckily, well, the first time was horrible, I thought it was the end of the world. And well, there we stood and we weren't treating each other fine, until one day, i said, well, what's going on?
horrible, really horrible, I said, look, you know what?, I think
Because, what will we do with a mediocre relationship? I don't want a mediocre relationship. As you say, there are some people who spend up to 30 years together, and in a crappy relationship
yes?
They, they mistreat each other. Like, you piece of who knows what, like, what's that? Why would I want-?
Right? you just respect, and
right?and there's some that say, that love, yes theres no love, no nothing.
of course of course, is your husband from chile?
you think it's easier?
and what, what's what you said?
what do you say? or when we're super b-
Hi, hi, how are you?
Oh, how are you?
Fine, and you?
That's great, and where are you originally... ?
Right? Me too
Really?
And how long have you been living here?
and his name?, and then came and went clear but more or less in the ninety-one , and you?
and you, where you from?
from Santiago too?
and some time you are in this? call by phone?
oh yes?
Hello?
Oh, are you already calling everyday?
Ah, why union shouldn't be or why one doesn't want to do it?
Yea. Yes, and do you like it here?
yes, well. and as but roamed beyond people use as car or more action?
and they tried to speak to me in Arab, I don't know. They found my face to be more Indian or something, but of course. Is there discrimination there or no?
And how did you end up in Idaho?
yes. I married a gringo, that's how I came here.  And you how, how?
oh really?
And so you're single now?
okay Ah, look. And what's this called, do you like it or not?
Hi, ¿how are you?, my name is Juan, Marcela.
Yeah, ¿how're you doing?
Hey, ¿didn't we talk the other day with?
I haven't forgotten you. We practiced together, ¿right?, Hey, but today's heath.
¿Do you have insurance here?, ¿are you covered?
That's a problem, right?
We're not covered. It's a problem, because there's always something that could happen, right?
people from the community, right?
to give information about the person that was hiring me and at that time well, that person didn't want to give the information, no?
and didn't they give you, eh, the attention?
no? yes, he gave me. Then yes, it's something that we thing about that well, there should be some type of more flexible, no, in order to well in case there is for the community but it's a certain type of community.
because there is more demand and because people pay for it. And so the costs keep on going up because people ask for more money. And the people that work ask for more money, it's a vicious circle. And so how can you all of a sudden create a social medicine?
Exactly.  It is a problem, it is a circle that works with earnings here they are stronger, no?
With that.  Because here I don't know there where you are living.  But, here if someone has money it is nurses and doctors.  No?
Then.  Mm. And well here as they say, you see a good car with a woman who is thirty, for example, no?
yes, yes I Uh uh.  Then who in this case well it is offered.  In Canada I understand well they have much medicine, no?
All their medicines are paid, they pay a little, ¿right?, but very little.
It's expensive, ¿right?; And then, i don't know how the medications are here, but well, in Mexico they're cheaper and its more like that
no? yes yes and here there is only one. And secondly the literature isn't the best. And if it is only the laboratories, and I think that all the NorthAmerican laboratories well eh
Strong interest in all, no?
Why don't you put yourself in contact with an organization that is called Shriners?
yes I knew that.  Hey, we ran out of time or what?
with the epilepsy, right?
right? then you know one is always hoping that it doesn't happen. Well I don't really know what really is going to happen, but right it does cause trauma, but poor son of mine because he is a teenager so
Sure, because on top of that he feels embarrassed. Look, how old is he?
yes, it's a stigma. It's a stigma. What he has, no? then
How old is he?
yes. Do you know where you can ask around? in the teaching hospitals
they'll see people that, that can't pay in a normal situation, you know? Like us who can't go to a specialized doctor because it's too expensive
Ah, yes?
with the University. Ah?
Mm. Uh uh.  Then, they told me no well you have to bring us information.  I had a letter about my income, etc., no?
no? wel not I.  But well then now I have my social security, myself.
Hello, how are you? my name is Juan
yes, how, how have you been?
listen, well all good this, what do you think about today's topic?
no, I didn't hear it, what is the topic?
and how do you consider the matter of technology, no?, your daily life, if it becomes more of a problem than a solution or something like that
this includes, automobiles, cars?
it is the same that, it is the same I was thinking, clearly, they should include it, no?
yes because it is a, you know? a machine
exactly, well, but, I said well yes, the automobile seems to be the most important, no?, it is- then I thought maybe it is the computer, but no
aha, exactly but sometimes, eh, what seems like a more personal element depending on the case, well it can be the car, no? because the computer is more and more another tool
well more than, than, sometimes, let's say that it belongs to the institution in which you are, no? it is more a work tool
but a tool like very personal seems to be the car, no?
because, you have to be careful with the car and, you know?
did you use horses more?
no? is like a horse, it is something like very, very, very personal, very closed
to, to your life. here take care of them and the is as important as, let't say, as the horse at that time, no?
eh, everything that allows the handling of the information and everything, right?
You need the car, you know? to, to work
exactly and here working people have like in that times like a mule, no? they need a a, a pick up a, truck pick up
really?, yes, yes
pick up truck, right? and listen, and it does not leave them, then is, eh, it is evident, like it is a hard work culture very, very important
and the computers, well, in every home there's television, telephone and computers basically, isn't it? but but like there are other dimensions of the technological cuestion, then the automobile seems to be
ah, what a- what technical, technological question is more important in your life? that's what we're discussing right now, if it should be the automobile or the computer, what do you think?
because, you know? because i have my cell phone and I'm always with it
and, well I've grown accustomed to having a cellphone, you know?
not always going back home for for, you know? seeing my messages
yes notice that it is, it's verry important what you just said, some time ago when i was working i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important thing, was it?
and well, on the computer were the messages, there was always the internet, the mails more than the phone, the cellphone, anything, right?
more phisical,no? then the car becomes the most important tool and the computer well, in a second plan even though it is also very important no?
well for me I believe that well you and you where around Texas and obiously you know that there is more how you say? i understand that there is more buildings and stuff around there you know?
is more of a problem then a help because a help but obviously you know? obviously
ah,yes?
but yes and in the city I believe the most imortant and depending on your work also well eh could be the computer no? then
the the other question o,o the tools of communication no? like you say the cellular.
well, what kind of problems could he have, right? like you said, with the car, the problems that have to do with the parking.
no? here in Texas no, there isn't, where I'm from there is not  major problems, no?, with the parking there is a lot of space everywhere, he hasn't presented
of transport, right? for example
charged their development costs, you understand me? I can't explain it very well but
Exactly yes, well like they say too, with the motor industry, right? if the motor industry would have advanced technologically much like the electronic industry then maybe an automobile will let us transport like
right? and instead of costing like twenty thousand dollars, it would only cost ten thousand dollars.
if that was the case, no? but, like the technology, in this case the industry, has their interests well no, like it does not advance, no? you can see already what they are saying now about the hybrids.
no?, no, I don't think that they have a real, a real, ehm that it is really a change like that very importanttechnological given the efficiency that
pardon?
no, I don't think that it is that important at the same time that the efficiency they have proven is not radically different to the ones others have it is very little, no? you see, I say
the pick up trucks are good they are changing to be more efficient you know?
but the expedition those cars are big so they are expensive you know? only they can go twenty miles, ten and eight miles per galon or something like that that's a huge expense
yes exactly  but at the same time cars like this, there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance that hybrids and they aren't hybrids no?
and smaller no? then if we compare with the spend of a hybrid against a small Europe car or those that run in latinoamerica so
How are you?
Good and yourself? How is the weather like in your house?
Over here weather is ugly, it is cold.  What do you think about the movies? Have you talked already about this topic?
is because you let him/her and you thought it could be, is that right?
I was asking myself, ah how is this? are you getting ready for Christmas yet?
What did you buy Miranda?
And you know who else has a birthday coming?
Yeah, who?
who?
yes, it's true, who?
Jua, Juan Luis is the eldest or the youngest?
Tamara, ¿how are you?, uh
Yeah, ¿and you?
Fine, fine. ¿Uh, where are you?
Yeah, you caught me off guard. But, ¿have you been participating long in this?
Didn't you, you got the same email, ¿right?, i mean, that apparently this will continue, you see, according to what i understood from the email they sent me.
Then, what do you think about what they show in the movies?
Say? Well I will tell you honestly, it's been more than a year since we stopped watching movies movies in the regular cinema and we move to the cinema
We moved to the cinema, for example in case of cinema, no? same as the one on television. Now we watch movies like Documentaries. Well... eh, with a different type of message.
Watch movies that are on on eh, what do you call it? the festivals, there we go for example, the recently finished International Festival of Latinamerican Cinema
upid, so dum that I felt bad to be there in the movie theater. I, well, what are we doing here? What a waste of time this is
What are you doing, right? I mean to watch that, really I prefer aco- lay down and go to sleep or I'd rather do something else instead of of, no I'm saying all of the movies, there are some that have a
uh huh, like great we have to make ten movies; we're going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter what? When? How it turns out, to the
forget about it, like we say, where are you from?
but then they repeat and repeat and repeat. Ay My God! What is this? we are paying for this then it's like an annoyance, right now we have like an annoyance with
And we were there and my husband, you know? this white man, paper white compared to my father and my mother is white so I left more than my father, so
and say hey, weren't we there this morning? i don't remember seeing that this morning.
he was there and people was protesting, Why?, the current President didn't do anything to remember the local victims
Hello?
Hello Fernanda How are you? My name is Claudia
How are you?
Where are you from? Good. How are you speaking?
and you're from, where are you from?
I think that hm the Americans are, not like the mo- standard morals have decreased, You understand me? then
But for example, I had one, one time cable and sometimes was,well, what you like? ten in the morning, eleven and well I like to be changing the channel.
because, ca-can be, let's say ten at night and the series on air never are so, you don't take the risk, do you? to be too poor like here. Here
oh, yes?
well what they see. no? in that aspect. But, uf
The way things are going soon even the ones from Disney, perhaps will have pornography, right? So
Because sometimes they even draw it. I don't know if you've seen commercials like that. All the same it doesn't scare you because you're already big, right? but
and even one gets used to it, do you understand me? let's say
Maybe it's... Mariza, we spoke to each other a few days ago, right?
Hey, well, today's subject is, the matter of religion, right?
Give an answer for. And it ends up being some form of control, right?
That, well, they represented a whole project of, ideology, but they really, they're one of the most conservative groups there are in the United States, right?
¿Really?
And against the theory, that they try to teach the theory about evolution, ¿right?
No, terrible, they said ¿why are they harassing teachers that teach the bible to explain how the world was created?
Right, they're fundamentalists, right?
yeah, more scientific right?, no, you don't have to believe only in what they say, they say god created man and woman, but also to give children a choice to believe
Well yes, but in this case, accepting differences seems to be related to humanity, eh?
yeah and you have? do you practice a particular religion?
Ah, how are you Carolina? You are speaking with Alex
What's up Alex?
Oh, okay, I thought that that, that you were someone else. Are you well?
Where are you from?
And you?
Columbian?
many many things, and and I don't like to wait for the pages, you understand?
And you?
The most essential, and mainly in the new techniques, right? the new technology that has arrived and every day new things come out, right?
write documents and forms, and all, now everything is done in the computer and the internet, right? it's something fascinating.
right, yes and for everything, right? that is it's everything that one
some information, but I sit down in the computer and there is not one to stop me, I don't know, it's like something, something essential and part of ones lifestyle, right?
yes, right. And how many calls have you made already?
But, but, who knows?
But, the payment is made after you finish the 25 calls, right?
Oh, yes?
Oh, Do you know the owner?
Oh, is he from California?
Oh, but you know him personally?
Oh, really?, i never talk with him.
Oh, yes?
oh, this is your second one, yes?
yeah, yeah, oh, and the other one was the same, twenty-five calls?
yea, and you got paid also, the same?
And what kind of technology do you use? What we are doing now is technology.
And you know what? Some day they are also going to make international to you favorite country.
How good would that be, right? yeah, that would be excellent for calling to the country whenever you wanted I think that if you're going to arrive, because with one of those cards also, right? Every day
before it was really expensive. You remember how it was? To call to the country
And now it's cheaper, right?
And why is it so cheap? Because of the technology.
and I had to be very careful and have the clock right in front of me, no?
yes, I've had, the truth is that, I hope that technology keeps advancing, I would say that in ten years time, what else will they come up with, no?
Because all that must keep on advancing, no?
do you get me?
they have to find cures for like cancer, if you can go to the moon, why can't they find a cure for cancer? I'm sure they can, if they can make
a super fast computer that can think, why can't they find a cure for cancer?
It's  true, because how long has cancer been around?
yes, and how many people it kills, ¿right?
and they can't find a cure for it, ¿right?, and they cand find it, ¿right?
¿Right?, and that shortens life for a lot of people.
¿Have you heard about a discovery of cancer?
I wish, no? I wish that something comes out, that that God enlightens us, so that when they find something that can eh, heal, for this catastrophe that is when cancer comes, it doesn't matter at what age, but it comes, no?
Oh my God, in three days? Oh.
