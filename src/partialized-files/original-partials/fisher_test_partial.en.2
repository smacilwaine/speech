Well ,  what do you think of tonight's topic ? 
are obvious ,  right ?  ,  But I think that the R rating is not very well defined about they can or can't have .  I agree that
many movies ,  right ?  ,  don't make any sense ,  for example ,  there are many gangster movies ,  so ,  many of the real gangster go and watch it because they
society ,  parents ,  families ,  they have a lot of the work in helping children to understand those things ,  right ?  ,  My kid ,  when she
Do you have teenagers ? 
if he does that if he has sex with a girl there can be lots of consequences that ,  that he can hav  ,  that can happen ,  you know ? 
Oh ,  I said ,  good heavens ,  how is it going to be ?  Hey ,  today we had a hard topic
Where are you from ? 
uh ,  I don't know if you have had the opportunity to listen to it before ? 
they change the facts of what's happening and so I always come across people that say ,  for example ,  they tell me ,  what do you think about that crazy President of yours ?  and
I wanted to say ,  that ,  they use it to say a lot of crazy things ,  right ? 
And you try to say that to someone ,  "Look ,  this is how it is ,  this ,  and this ,  didn't you realize ? " Then they say no to you ,  because you were
Exactly ,  that's what they say to me sometimes .  "What are you doing here ? "
because What are you doing here ?  And well ,  same as you ,  thank goodness .  You are here ,  no in Venezuela . 
in a susprisingly big way ,  the people can not take it anymore ,  but they don't protest ,  and I say My G d but ,  What happens with the people ?  so .  . 
but I tell you ,  I don't know ,  suddenly here You are in Pennsylvania ,  you told me ? 
me too ,  at the beginning I had no access to that and that website was like ,  my God ,  is it true what they are saying there in Venezuela ?  But I would talk to my friends and
and they would say ,  no girl ,  what's that ?  Look ,  I ,  that's a lie ,  but you see ,  the power of television is
Sure ,  sure ,  what are you doing there in Philadelphia ? 
Oh ,  and you like it there more than Miami  ? 
And ,  what you're going to do  ?  works is first ,  first place
Right ,  right ,  and fi  ,  and here ,  what you do  ? 
But ,  from how you've been around here in United States  ? 
Twelve  ? 
So ,  I would also look at American people and would treat them badly but now ,  I have understood that they are not to blame ,  and that they are people from the United States ,  they are not Americans ,  that's a badly understood term ,  isn't it ?  So , 
why ?  Why
Well ,  my name is Ibet ,  with whom do I have the pleasure ? 
Hi Mercedes ,  how are you ?  Where are you from Mercedes ? 
Oh ,  from Honduras ? 
Ah ,  from where ?

And what do you think about today's subject ?  What if it's more eh it's easier to break up with someone young or ,  or if the age makes a difference . 
And some time did you have a difficult break up ? 
yes ? 
eh ,  I am going to have three children and I was already building castles on air when one time he cane and said ,  you know what ?  Not I ,  here it ends .

I thing that must be the worst experience ,  i think ,  of your life ,  yes ,  and i hope ,  i hope i never have it because ,  we don't know ,  ¿right ? 
It's impossible to maintain a ,  ¿right ?  ,  a situation like that ,  like
If you always love the person ,  well it's impossible for it to be only peace ,  that's what I'm saying ,  ¿right ? 
because one ,  because I ,  I'm one ,  It's human and one has to ,  things that very upset other people ,  right ?  and
yes ,  the truth me bein  i think it has to be something for real ,  eh very hard eh ,  keeping it everything happy ,  right ?  but
that ,  of course ,  you aren't meeting him profusely ,  right ?  until you're already married with that person but it's but i think that i think that
the drama is __  ,  it is ,  ehm ,  a lot ,  right ?  and and then people don't know how to leave that cycle of ,  of abuse ,  right ?  that is what happens
And I told her ,  And now you with glasses ?  Was cloudy the day ,  really And she had a hit that her boyfriend did to her . 
your boyfriend and she said ,  well it is ,  it is too difficult to end the relationship with him ,  and I told her ,  why ?  she says

What do they speak ? 
But they will have that option ,  so .  Some parents even mix the sign language with the oral part ,  right ?  It depends on the
And what do you think about today's subject ,  about the ? 
ah ,  sometimes ,  it's quite hard ,  right ?  I think that love is the only thing that help us get over the difficulties ,  just that . 
well ,  they will overcome them ,  do you agree ? 
and twelve imagine and and for real we have had well , two critical moments ,  at the point of separation .  and there came a time that maturity set in .  it plays an important role No ? 
ah ,  I say like that ,  that if I fall ,  I get up again .   What is the problem ? 
No ?  I mean ,  exactly .   Then ,  fortunately ,  well ,  eh ,  the first time was rather horrible ,  because I thought it was the end of the world .   And ,  well ,  there we were ,  and we lasted a good time that we were not dealing with each other until one day I said ,  well ,  but ,  what is happening ? 
Mm ,  horr  ,  horrible ,  horrible .   I told him ,  loo ,  you know what ?  yes ,  it seems to me . 
because we're going to do with a mediocre relationship ?  I do not want a mediocre relationship . as you say ,  people who spend up to thirty years together ,  that's a pigs relationship . 
Yes ? 
that they are treated badly .  no piece of that thing ,  what is that ?  that I want ? 
No ?   They just respect each other ,  and , 
No ?   And ,  there are others that say ,  love .   If there is not love ,  there isn't anything . 
Sure .   Sure .  Your husband is Chilean as well ? 
You think is easier ? 
And what ,  what was it you told me ? 
what are you saying ?  Oh when we were super

And and you ,  where are you from ? 
From Santiago too ? 
And have you been in this thing long ?  Of calling by telephone ? 
oh yes ?

Hello ,  how are you ?  my name is Juan .  Marcela
yes ,  how are you ? 
I have not forget you ,  we talked nicely ,  right ? 
Do you have Medical insurance here ?  are you cover ? 
that is a problem right ? 
community people ? 
to give information about the person who was hiring me and at that time well the person refused to give information ,  right ? 
So they didn't give you ,  erm ,  care ? 
Isn't it ?  Yes ,  he gave it to me .  So yes ,  it is something we think that well there should be some kind of bit more flexible ,  right ,  so that by itself there is for the community but it is a specific type of community
Because there is more demand and people pay .  And then costs go up because people ask more more money .  And working people ask for more money ,  it is a vicious circle .  An so how could it suddenly ,  could they create social medication ? 
Exactly .  That's a problem ,  it's a circle that works with profit , it's stronger ,  right ? 
Because ,  well ,  i don't know how it works where you live ,  but here ,  people with money are nurses and doctors ,  right ? 
is expensive ,  right ?  And I don't know how the prescription drugs are here ,  In Mexico are cheaper and also
No  ?  yes yes ,  And here you don't have more than one .  And second ,  that literature is not the best .  And if you hear only about laboratories ,  I thought that all the North American laboratories for 
Strong interest in everything ,  no  ? 
according to what expertise you have to operate here .  Do you know what you should do  ? 
Because don't they get you in contact with an organization that's called the Shriners  ? 
yes I knew that .   Listen ,  did the time run out already or what ? 
with epilepsy ? 
Of course because on top of that it embarrasses him .   Let's see ,  how old is he ? 
yes ,  yes ,  it is a stigma .   It is a stigma .   What he has ,  no ?  then
How old is he ? 
yes Do you also know where to find out ?   In the hospitals where they teach
see people that not ,  that can not pay in the situation like a normal ,  see ?   Like us that can not go to a specialist doctor because it costs a lot of money
Oh ,  really ? 
with the University .  oh ? 
Mm .  Uh ,  uh .  So then ,  if they told me no ,  well you have to bring us information .  I had a letter showing my income and so on ,  right ? 
No ?  well not me .  But ,  well then ,  now I have my social security ,  myself . 
Hy ,  how are you  ?  my name is Juan
yes ,  what ,  you where what  ? 
listen ,  here is all good ,  what do you think about today's topic  ? 
no ,  i didn't listen ,  what is the topic  ? 
and how do you consider the issues of the technology ,  no  ?  you daily life ,  if it turn more of a problem than a solution ,  something like that
that includes the automobiles ,  the cars  ? 
it's the same as ,  as i was thinking ,  exactly that ,  they should include it ,  no  ? 
exactly ,  how's then ,  but ,  i told then that yes ,  the car look as the most important ,  no  ?  and i think after that at best a computer too ,  but no
aha ,  exactly but sometimes ,  eh ,  it looks more like a personal element depending on the case ,  could be the cars ,  no  ?  because the computer already is a tool more
than the ,  sometimes ,  we say that belongs to the institution where you are ,  no  ?  more like a job tool
but a more personal tool looks like is a car ,  no  ? 
why you have to take care of the car ?  ,  you know ? 
you used more horses ? 
no ?  is like a horse ,  is something like ,  very ,  very ,  very personal ,  a close thing
eh ,  as permitted the information management and all that thing ,  no ? 
you need the car ,  you know ?  ,  to work
exactly and here the working people have like as in those days ,  a mule .  no ?  ,  they need one ,  a pick up ,  truck pick
ah ?  yes ,  yes
pick up truck ,  no ? 
and the computers ,  well ,  since practically there is there is television ,  telephone and computers in all homes ,  no ?  but but like there are other dimensions no ?  about the technological question ,  then the car seems to be
oh ,  what  what technical question ,  technological is more important in your life ?   that is what we are discussing right now if it would have to be the car or if it would have to be the computer ,  what do you think ? 
because you know ?  because I have my cell phone and I am always with it
and ,  well I have gotten used to having a cell phone ,  you know ? 
I'm not always returning to the house for ,  you know ?   see my messages
 ,  yes look that yes ,  that is very important what you have just said ,  a long time ago when I worked I had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important ,  no ? 
and well ,  the messages were on the computer ,  I was always on the internet ,  the emails more than the phone ,  neither cell phone nor anything no ? 
more physical ,  right ?  Then the car becomes the ins  the more important device and the computer ,  well ,  is a second level ,  even though it's also very important ,  right ? 
good for I think ,  how good ,  you and ,  you were in Texas and obviously you know ,  there there's more ,  uh ,  how do you say it ?  I understand you have more like farms and everything there ,  you know ? 
It's more of a problem than a tor  than ,  than a help ,  but obviously ,  you know ? 
Oh ,  yeah ? 
But yeah in ,  in the city I think that yeah ,  the most impor  and depending on the work too ,  well ,  uh ,  it could be the computer ,  right ?  Then
the ,  the other question or ,  or the communication devices ,  right ?  Like you said ,  the cell phone and
alright ,  what kind of problems he could have  ?  like you just said ,  the only problems with the car could come from parking
no  ?  ,  here in Texas we dont't ,  especially where i am ,  have that problem with the parking ,  lots of open spaces ,  didn't come up
transportation ,  no  ?  ,  for example
aha ,  but ,  don't you think is a bit magnificent the change happened in like sixty years  ? 
charge their costs ,  do you get me  ?  ,  i don't think i explain very good
exactly yes ,  like they say too ,  with the auto industry right  ?  if they advanced technologically like the electronic one the best car would transport us with
right  ?  and instead of costing you ,  say ,  20 . 000 dollars ,  would cost you 2000
if that were the case ,  no ?  but ,  as technology ,  in this case the industry ,  has its interests then no ,  like it doesn't move forward ,  no ?  you see what they're saying now with the hybrids
no ?  no ,  it doesn't seem to me that they have a real a real ,  this that it's really a very important change like technological given the efficiency that
what ? 
you don't think it is an important change ,  or ? 
no ,  I don't think that it is so important every time that the efficiency they demonstrate isn't radically different to the one the other cars have is very little ,  no ?  you see ,  I say
the pickup well not the pick up trucks because they're changing them so that they're more efficient ,  you know ? 
but ,  but the expedition and those enormous cars and that they spend ,  you know ?  can only go like twenty miles ,  eighteen miles per gallon something like that ,  that is an enormous expense
yes exactly and and of course ,  and but ,  at the same time for example with these autos of um ,  there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance as the hybrids ,  and they're not hybrids ,  no ? 
and smaller ,  no ?  so if we compare the costs of a hybrid against a small European car ,  or or from Iso which circulate in latinamerica well then
being less to what an auto has ,  a good economic car ,  no ? 
why is it that the United States is one of the only nations that has this ,  that ,  you have these enormous autos only here ,  you know ? 
over there in other countries they all have small cars that well ,  different ,  different culture ,  you know ?  but
I though well ,  there will be a change in the culture ,  but that was only for the moment ,  no ?  ,  it seems because it has some enormous cars ,  they continue like
How are you ? 
Good and you ,  How is the weather over there in your house ? 
Over here it's ugly ,  we are too cold .  What do you think of the movies ?  Have you already talked about this topic ? 
it's because you let him and you thought it could be ,  isn't it ? 
that´s what I say ,  you can control them ,  you cannot see this movie because of this or that .  Because you lack of maturity or whatever we want to tell them ,  isn´t that true ?

Then ,  what do you think about what they show in the movies the ? 
Tell me ?  Well i am going to tell you honestly ,  it has been more than a year since we stopped watching movies movies in regular movie theaters and we started at the theater
watch movies that are in hum how is this called ?  the movie festivals ,  here as an example recently ended the International Latin American Movie Festival
tupid ,  so dumb that I was bothered to be in the movie theatre ,  I well ,  and what are we doing here ?   What waste of time is this ? 
What are you doing no ?   I mean to see that ,  honestly I rather go to sleep or I'd rather do something else instead of of ,  I don't tell you all movies ,  there are some that have a
aha ,  like well we have to make ten movies .  we are going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter ,  how ?  or when ?  however it comes out ,  without
care ase we say .   Where are you from ? 
but then they show it again and show it again and show it again .  Oh my God .  What is this ?  we are paying for this then it is like a discomfort ,  right now we have a discomfort with

because ,  they c  can show ,  let's say at ten in the evening and the programs they show are never so ,  you don't don't run the risk ,  no ?  that they would be so bad like here .  Here
ah yes ? 
well you see , no ?  in that aspect , but uf . 
As the things are going ,  even the Disney ones may have pornography in a while ,  ¿right ?  then
Because sometimes they even draw it for you .  I do not know if you have seen such commercials that uf .  They do not scare you because you are already grown up ¿right ?  but
and one gets accustomed ¿do you understand ?  so to speak
really ? 
No ,  terrible ,  they said ,  Why this harassment of teachers that teach the bible to explain the creation of the world ? 
aha ,  do you ,  do you  follow any particular religion ? 
oh ,  how are you carolina ?  do you talk to Alex

and you ? 
colombian ? 
a lo  ,  lots of things ,  and ,  and I don't like to wait for ,  the websites ,  you understand me ? 
And you ? 
the most essential ,  and above all uh ,  and in the new techniques ,  no ?  the new technology that has arrived and each day newer things come out ,  no ? 
type documents and reports ,  and all ,  now everything is done by the computer and the internet ,  no ?  I mean that is it something marvelous
for me ,  it's essential ,  I think that I wouldn't know what I could do if without the computer ,  no ?  So ,  the truth is that I am very happy with this new technology ,  and hopefully it continues
advancing more each day ,  no ? 
Uh huh ,  yes ,  and for everything ,  no ?  I mean that it's everything that one
some information ,  well I sit at the computer and there is no one to stop me ,  I don't know ,  that when someone is already like something ,  an essential part of one's life ,  no ? 
Right ,  of course ,  ¿and how many calls have you made already ? 
Bu  ,  but ¿who knows ? 
But and ,  the payment is made after you finish the twenty five calls ,  ¿right ? 
Oh ,  ¿yeah ? 
Oh ,  ah ,  You know the owner ? 
Oh ,  he's from ,  Is he from California ? 
Ah ,  but you know him personally ? 
Oh ,  okay ,  oh ,  yes ?  Oh ,  no ,  I never talk to him ,  I . 
Oh ,  yes ? 
Oh ,  this is your second one ,  oh is it ? 
I see ,  I see Oh ,  and was the other one the same ,  twenty five phone calls ? 
I see ,  and they paid you ,  as well ,  the same ? 
And what other technology do you use ?   What we're doing now is technology . 
And you know what ?  One day they will make it international too to your favorite country . 
How great ,  right ?  Like so ,  it would be excellent to make country calls ,  there when one wants I think it will come ,  because with that thing about the cards too ,  right ?  every day
it was expensive before .  did you remember before ?  to call the country of
And it is cheaper right ? 
And why is it cheap ?  Because of technology . 
and so I had to be keeping track of the clock ,  no ? 
yes ,  I've had ,  to be honest ,  I hope that technology keeps on advancing because I think that in ten  years ,  what else are they coming up with ,  right ? 
You know ,  this has to keep on advancing ,  right ? 
do you understand ? 
You have to look for cure to illnesses like cancer ,  eh ,  yes ,  you can go to the moon so ,  why can't they find a cure for cancer ?  Yes ,  it can be done ,  if they can do a
super fast computer ,  one can think ,  why aren't they looking for a cure for cancer ? 
Yes ,  how many people ,  right ?  Kills
And they haven't found a cure ,  have they ?  They haven't found it ,  have they ? 
They haven't ?  And this shortens the lives of many people . 
Have you heard of a discovery of a cure for cancer ?

Oh my god .  In three days ?  Oh
