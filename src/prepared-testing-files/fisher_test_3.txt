As I say   if I fall down   i just put myself up   Whats the problem  
Because   what will we do with a mediocre relationship   I dont want a mediocre relationship   As you say   there are some people who spend up to 30 years together   and in a crappy relationship

English and then they have to go around but not like other people   you know how in every place   they are average
yes   yes   Of course  
of course  
yes but  
of course for example in the rural areas of Georgia you would see things like you see the Ku Klux Klan I dont know
Oh   yes really  
Oh   mm
And those weird things but is very very far from the city I mean
Eh  
Eh  
Oh   Oh   how weird  
Oh I married a Gringo  
yes   I married a gringo   thats how I came here    And you how   how  
yes   and so thats why we came to we went to Seattle in ninety one   I was about eleven years old
Mm  
Oh   okay
Mm   okay
And so youre single now  
Yes something like that   I am like we live together
Oh   okay
Well then sure  
okay Ah   look   And whats this called   do you like it or not  
on they way from San Felipe to the Andes that is like a question more more rural and you couldnt imagine how
Oh
typical Chilean countryside and I loved it  
It was a village   what do I know   I like to be inside the city because I know theres more going on   like you know   there are more things to do  
yes   I can Imagine
half
same in contact   is difficult also
Here   yes   same but not so much   Not so much   Like when   even   at least less mall   is not too big  
Yeah   ¿howre you doing  
Yeah   i think so   youre in Texas and Im in North Carolina  
Oh   yeah   me too  
Uh   Im covered through my husband  
Uh   uh  
Oh   well   look   were   Were not  
And the   yeah   And the other day i went precisely to a   an office in which they supposedly give some kind of   i mean   pension for
people from the community   right  
Yes
And well the papers that they asked me with my address and proof of work   And   finally they found an excuse to not   not giving it to me because they asked me
Mm  
and and   in my case   I have a son with epilepsy  
And   then he needed some some emergency attention here things that
eh   no   No   no   They didnt want to give me the prescription   Right   So in the cases that press with him   he was in a bad way once   yes   He became worse  
the costs of   the cost of everything   depends on demand   And so if those costs keep on going up   up and up
The money doesnt stop being like a drug   you see    They are already used to a certain amount of money  
And then now   suddenly they are not going to have it  
Then the interest is wors
We would stop making bombs and going to war    Look   all that money that could be put
on schools or in a medical system   social medicine  
Mm   Yes  
yes    Tell me   twenty   thirty dollars an hour  
yes   yes I Uh uh    Then who in this case well it is offered    In Canada I understand well they have much medicine   no  
No   but the difference is that they started right  
Yeah   its like in Argentina   my parents have their full medications paid
Uh   uh
Yeah   yeah   yeah   Thats the other thing   you could at least try to pay something  
in other places around the world   Everywhere around the world  
Uh   uh
Uh   and then   uh   we went to Argentina last year   i went to the drugstore and i showed them something that was over fifty dollars here
i bought it there for twelve dollars
Yeah   yeah   yeah
Twelve dollars   the same brand and all  
with some ingredients
Mm  
Mm  
Well what do I know   apparently that things yes like that
But  
yes  
Uh uh   ah yes  
Ehm   because they help the children  
Mm  
yes  
Uh uh    Uh uh    Well yes look   yes
yes I knew that    Hey   we ran out of time or what  
yes    Maybe I am making a mistake in not finding out you see it doesnt cost anything  
And also if you call the Catholic Charities
Uh    Uh uh   That is true  
There are lots of samples   And   but knowing a little bit more about the advances   Its because I can give out the medicine we think that one diagnostic more profound could improve the lifestyle of my son with
because It had been under control   but lately he has as close to two years that It has been disconnected   He has been out of control  
And   well   yes   they gave him another one   They leveraged him and it didnt work so by no means   he had to take it off and return to the basics  
what
yes   yes   you know   it is matter of experimenting  
well yes   sometimes yes  
all the time yes  
life without you telling me is always pending   all the time  
Hmm
It happens in school and he feels really bad  
seventeen
ah   sure   hes a teenager
Eh   yes   well   returning to the subject   I think he should try with some good
System of   eh
With the doctors   The medical centers that have medical schools
Uh
Sometimes the different departments there
yes
hmm
And we dont have that much money
Hmm   yes
And they   they make notes of what they give you   And they charge accordingly   Something that always is   uhmm
Mm  
Of month   and that   is is this interesting   I had to make myself an abscess   I it turns out that I have a thing that is called ADD
and they didnt charge me anything and they did all the exams  
yes  
I told them  
Mm   Uh uh    Then   they told me no well you have to bring us information    I had a letter about my income   etc     no  
They didnt want to give you that information  
Mm  
Maybe now you can
Uh uh  
Hello   how are you   my name is Juan
Hello   well eh   Mateo here
I am in San Antonio    Mateo   I think we had already talked   you are in Philadelphia
yes   how   how have you been  
no   I didnt hear it   what is the topic  
the topic are technical gadgets   I mean technology   the gadgets you use the most and that you depend on then and if   how do you consider that dependence
it is the same that   it is the same I was thinking   clearly   they should include it   no  
yes because it is a   you know   a machine
exactly   well   but   I said well yes   the automobile seems to be the most important   no     it is  then I thought maybe it is the computer   but no
yes   the most obvious one is the computer well   but   it is not the only
ah
but a tool like very personal seems to be the car   no  
yes   and because of that   the same thing you buy a car and you are always using it and you always have to maintain it   you always have   it is some part of your life
yes yes   exactly   besides like I am here in Texas
Okay
I believe that here the car culture is something like a reminiscence of the horses culture also
yes
to   to your life   here take care of them and the is as important as   lett say   as the horse at that time   no  
yes
Some years ago and   and well   well if dont say   so in our time of communication the most important devices are going to be the related with communication   the computer
yes   because   here in Texas yes   but even there in Texas
but
yes
so
exactly and here working people have like in that times like a mule   no   they need a a   a pick up a   truck pick up
pick up truck   right   and listen   and it does not leave them   then is   eh   it is evident   like it is a hard work culture very   very important
right
of the most most important
yes   but       the cuestions on the topic were what
well   for mi it would be more my computer and my cell phone
aham   exactly
aham
aham
back then   i didnt had a cell phone until i was like twenty   but now that a  that i live in Philadelphia in the city and that Im not always going back home fo 
not always going back home for for   you know   seeing my messages
yes   yes
well Im always always   always having my cellphone
having your cellphone
i think its very its like surprising that almost everyone has a cellphone here in the united states
yes
and well   on the computer were the messages   there was always the internet   the mails more than the phone   the cellphone   anything   right  
yes
the computer was the most important
but now
but now  with the type of work that I am doing the car is the most important   the computer because the car is what permits re type of job that I am doing
well it is because the type of work well
LOT MORE SPACE
yes yes
for in the   in the city having a car can be an inconvenience as well  
yes   yes   that yes
because you have to try and park and have to pay to park and the gas station is not close   and I dont know es
better to have a car I think
yes eh  yes because of the distance I have to travel in my work the car is more fundamental
yeah sure
yeah
and that and eh   and the uestion is if you consider that you are eh this technology becomes more a problem then then in
right
no   here in Texas no   there isnt   where Im from there is not  major problems   no     with the parking there is a lot of space everywhere   he hasnt presented
Lets say   those problems here   but in the end   I dont know   I dont know what your opinion is   above everything I would say that   well   in regards with the cars   matter of cars and all that well it doesnt look like a big problem unless
we could consider a problem the interests created around the   motor industry and like so sometimes they affect the growing of technology  
right   but dont you think that   that its very awesome that it changed in about sixty years  
yes
a   yes we seen how sixty five years ago there wasnt any cars   but nowadays everyone has it
yes  yes   yes but   yes
and the same thing with computers they have   they have computers that wont go off the market for like ten years because
well
because they have those things very advanced and the things have not cumbri  have not cum 
yes
Exactly yes   well like they say too   with the motor industry   right   if the motor industry would have advanced technologically much like the electronic industry then maybe an automobile will let us transport like
one hundred kilometers with one liter of gas  
right
yes
that no   most of them say that they are not feasible and that in reality it is only a matter of image that the companies manage and when the time comes to see the   the scoreboard
regarding hybrid automobiles well I thought that they were going to be much more efficient I think that the efficiency they have achieved is minimal
yes
yes   that was an important change
you dont think that it is an important change   or
oh
a   a  according to the rules an economy car drives you it could be thirty six miles per gallon
aha
and a hybrid can drive you fifty
oh no   ehm yes sure   sure that   there are cares around right now like the   the Fords
oh so
OK
yes exactly  but at the same time cars like this   there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance that hybrids and they arent hybrids no  
by small cars   news that are not in the North American market   they are in the European market or Latino American where they have to be more efficient
oh yes
it goes out more expensive have a car for the initial spend and for what you can save in gasoline finally
its less that you have a car very low cost no
and why is that
European
because the united states is one of the ony nations that have this you only have big cars here you know
yes i am yes
there in other countries  have smaller cars its good a different culture you know but
yes i just a few years ago the oil problem   in the eighties or something like that i dont remember
OK
i thought i was having an exchange of culture because they started to develope little more here in the united states
yes but
i thought well i was going to have an exchange of culture but that was nothing by the time no it seems because they have a big cars they keep like
I am Ana Maria
Oh Faviola   hi
Hi Faviola
How are you  
Very nice   sunny or cold
sunny and cold   oh
cold
yes
I also had that topic before
I did not had that topic before and I had to talk about it   specifically the person I had to talk to talked about violence
mhm
No   he liked the idea of going to see movies    I told him   the world is the world    It has violence
mhm
Always had   and have the experience to teach children abroad peace and love on television oh   oh in the world and later when they face the real world which is the school
You find that   little kids hit him   that they do not know how to defend themselves    Moreover   when you have only children
OK
then oh   I find that it is good the classification they have   I believe that is the adults responsibility   until when the children can watch television
I agree   the maximum responsibility lies within the parents
The are doing their job the one who make movie and
they are earning money   what is your job  
in their business   you
doing their business   yes
yes   now the one who wants it   take it   who wants to see it   do not want to see it   is not their responsibility   they see
of   yes
that sells
yes
And is what they do   it is not their fault   is the fault of the ones who buy
yes   the one who likes the product   for that reason
yes
With you that is the most responsibility   whether is in violence   of sex   of what ever you want to protect a   a child in    The responsibility is of the parents   even if there is a classification  
Because   if there is a movie classification   for example   PG thirteen
yes
If you have younger child and if you let him/her watch the movie is your responsibility
yes
exactly
So then   because I   the the association   or   or   or whoever places   places the classification   already have it then  
I think if   imagine   we think more or less the same in that Faviola because   at the end you realize that the responsibility or raising and take care and of what you want them to see and not see
Your children   or your family   Eh   your mother or your husband like mother
MM i think i totally agree and the other   normally the children have access to television whenever parents are not home
Exactly
children are alone
mhm
And there isnt a father there to show or teach   you cant view this   view that
And if they make a sleepover   you dont know either
Right   no you dont have a clue
If they go a sleepover and they put a movie   watch it in that house without control and whatever
You never know
Exactly
I think the important is give them one   To respect that rules and if you give them good principles at home   Your family   ans show him things
Right
Exactly that i dont like or i dont like it   You must see if youre prepared   the moment will surely come
Why   because like they say   you cant have them in a crystal box
No   and besides
yeah   exposed boy or exposed girl
yes   and when they reach a certain age   My son had around 15 years and he tells me   Dont worry youve the best you could
mhm
ah   25% is the genes and education and the rest decision   my life decisions
Look   with that
Sure   then I learned   Oh   wait   no eh   oh   I was and
mm
My cell phone was ringing   OK   OK wait and Ill answer  
OK
Eh   dont hang up because we need to talk for twelve minutes  
yes
It   I only went to turn it off  
OK ah
And about the people   I think   on the movies I love to watch horror films  
Yeah
But sometimes that   that Im scared   Im a adult  
You   you scare yourself  
I get scared and Im going to find out about horror movies  
Yes   yes   but your responsibility is to watch it   and you scare yourself
yes
Yes   I dont like them and I dont watch them   I dont watch any kind like that   That is why its my decision bec  even if I have the age to watch it   if its too aggressive   I dont want to watch it  
Yes   thats why   thats why I respect what my son told me that time   fifty per cent is responsibility  
yes
of   of the individual   of the person   eh   you already did the best you could   but it comes an age in boys before they are eighteen
Some are more mature than others  
yes
and they start watching rated r movies  
mm
at the age of fourteen and fifteen   and eleven and twelve year olds are watching pg 13 movies  
yeah right  
and sometimes even kids   and even younger kids   because i remember   my friend jenny had a kid that watched harry potter  
yeah thirteen yeah
PG thirteen PG fourteen   so i say   jenny doesnt like that   she gets scared  
yeah
shes scared of monsters   and all that
yeah
but i agree   that the major part is the criteria that you make of it   to take care of them if they dont want too  
yeah why   why
not just leave them with the tv  
but imagine if you cant control it  
but its only tv  
thats what i mean   you can control it   you need to be more mature   it isnt true  
we need to have criteria formed   to watch movies  
yeah thats why i said you dont get anything good out of watching it   like at his friends house  
aha   in the same school they show them movies  
Oh the same school   but the same school is a little more supervised because thats already another thing   Because they have a purpose  
They show them documentaries  
But what I fear the most is when they go to their friends house   And they sometimes have the television right there in the room   which is so customary nowadays   or the computer or whatever  
And they have access to information without their parents   without their parents having any idea   And they are in the room their parents think that they are listening to music or whatever
Perhaps they are watching something inappropriate   Thats why   I mean what happens   is that if my daughter or son or whatever it is  
faces that situation he has to learn to value himself   And learn to respond to that   Thats what I say   in other words   trying to instill in him the home values  
Follow like superman the little boy that climbed on the window and got killed  
of course   because you know they are still not prepared  
aha
eh   did you read the rules that are in this   phone game  
yes Okay
yes   yes   yes Im getting ready Im already buying the gifts for the family   But now I have   I have other things on my mind  
is your birthday no  
Buy something for the adults   a little something   either way Im going to make the majority of the gifts  
Thats what I was going to tell you
Im going to cook   yes ah
cook and boil   To boil that thing you made   that thing you gave me
Two days before Miranda
Andreita has her birthday too   Oh   three
Por te pre  one of those screens where you draw and then can erase it
Ah   how nice
Because she likes them   she   she already knows them   and she likes them   she draws little lines and then she erases them   and   I wont give the to her yet because theyre very small and shell put them in her mouth
But meanwhile   youll give her the pencil and the screen
Ah   how nice
But yes   because little things like that
Im excited  
Of course   you see   then   Those things like that are nice to do   so I bought the same thing for little Andrea   And that was it  
And you know who else has a birthday coming  
On the same date
that I remember from when I was there
My father in law   who
Your father in law   yes
Him   him   Juan Luis   Sandras youngest son  
Oh   yes   yeah
Also on the twenty  the twenty ninth   I also remember that more or less around the same date   I remember that they were all around the same date  
I dont remember of his of being in I didnt know at least  
I havent gone to any birthday to Sandras house   I went to only one   but I dont remember   to tell you the truth  
Eh   it was in April   then   when i went to Chile it was April
OK   that was another birthday   she has three  
No   but Sandra will not celebrate her birthday   she wont have a party that year
no   no   okay
No   she said no   just for the family   because theyre going to buy something better for the kid
yes   its true
And really   she makes parties that are too big
she spends too much   yes
too much   she spends too much on that and they cant buy what they really want for the kid
what they really want   exactly
they   of course   They have to decide between one or the other   so yes   this year   the kid decided he wants just the family
The youngest of all
ah   okay
And   and he says   I dont want any clothes
Poor thing
I dont want books   only toys
Carolina  
Tamara   ¿how are you     uh
Yeah   ¿and you  
Im in Seattle   Washington state
Wow   Im in Los Angeles  
Oh   yeah
Yes   its just incredible
Yeah
Right now i was making a phone call   and suddenly   i mean   i didnt think today was sunday   i was more asleep than awake   and i   ¡Oh my god  
Yeah   this is   i think this is my twenty three call  
Oh   ok   ok   yeah   because i got an email that theyre taking back people that are participating again   uh   because at first you could only participate once
Yes
Yeah   i   its
Its more like   right   tell me
not so "Conventional"
aha
Watch movies that are on on eh   what do you call it   the festivals   there we go for example   the recently finished International Festival of Latinamerican Cinema
a pretty different message   thats worth seeing but lately Ive felt like theyre making movies   like to make them
uh huh exactly  
Im from Panama
Ah   okay Im from Venezuela
Oh okay
Aha   yes
in   then yes its true   its true
We say thus to "Macha" no   because good   if they make films like they want to but yes they leave good ones leave and others   if they dont leave dont leave but
Honestly no   And the same is passing right now with the television   We had cable and now he just has a question of we cut it to a month because no   I dont know suddenly like
that we put ourselves against what we saw that there was a lot of manipulation of the average ones they only pass the news to you that agrees with them they hide the truth
eh then that is concerning those of the reporters and the films then if thats not one film thats really very good very good
but then they repeat and repeat and repeat   Ay My God   What is this   we are paying for this then its like an annoyance   right now we have like an annoyance with
with mass media we are thus reluctant   yes yes  
I think aha  
Because whenever you see something or they give something to you well stupid
Exactly  
or you have it or they exaggerate to you enough
Exactly  
Ay maginate
And we were there and my husband   you know   this white man   paper white compared to my father and my mother is white so I left more than my father   so
when we left you know that he was American  
Logical   logical  
exactly  
exactly  
exactly
because its not true   and that
so bad what happened  
oh yeah
no no he doesnt remember  
I see
he was there and people was protesting   Why     the current President didnt do anything to remember the local victims
I think they were called Los de Richos   Chinos   That zone practically disappeared   the whole town
of from Chorrillo
yes   from Chorrillo   exactly
yes   thats were he was   Thats were was the police   or part of the polce
which happened a long time ago   then they put it here in Venezuela and I dont know   The Other day i wrote to one of the journalist
which is crazy   what its really happening is that the press is changing the information   so he appears to be a monster   a dict
ator   well a dictator   we have gone through four elections and for referendums   i cant be more democratic   But it is his personality   his personality is
one in a million   and people dont accept that   Its not a common man   and people dont accept it   then he is the first criticizing that
But specifically   i watch the governments channel there   the national channel   Because the other channels are from the opposition   so of course its a little bit more of the same  
from the whole world   you compare   this is what is happening there   ah and that also happens with the radio   we listen to public radio   radio that you feel is
they are really saying the truth or at least   you have a different point of view   I mean we dont get the whole truth but sometimes   its not as
biased as the other one   I dont know   I cant say that what the others say is
aha
false but they do manipulate the information
yes
I dont know if you
Hello  
did you watch   Im not sure   did you watch a movie named "Auto Fox"
No   I might have   I dont remember
Its a documentary about Fox News
mhm
and well its about people that used to work there and they said they were forced to lie   they quit the channel and they got together and they started to complain
on a local level   local   to tell the world whats happening there   in Fox News   Its quite interesting   its something like
"The workers from Fox that are out"
some
Something like "out" from outside
aha
and Fox of Fox News
My name is
Hello my name is Fernanda
from Washington
ah   Which of the two
Washington DC
ah   b
yes Washington State
ah   already and the other
Yes I am here in the state of Idaho and I dont know if you know it
yes yes of course
if this truth because I see lot of that in the movies a lot of truth in my view I dont really quite agree with them
they are not ranked very well you know   Eh   for example they sometimes say its PG and then you see it eh that movie and really
they have pornography  sometimes and later itsPG thirteen Sometimes its not is more calm
and does not have as many things as nudity or profanity to be true to those classifications for me its not like that sometimes
We dont know the people that critique these movies   and we dont know the classification o   or we dont know what it was from your point of view
Yes   I dont know much about the truth of films
aha
Lets say   I dont have children or nothing like that   then almost I notice      
aha
But I think that the majority of television that are   lets say   if you see during the mid day that is when a lot of times the kids are at home  
yes
yes
Now lots of things are like normal   that   that I think it will not be  
yes   it is true because   hm and is true because hmm   one time   well I dont have cable dont have   the normal channels   the ones to see  
mhm
And sometimes passing movies that really   uf   if a child of ten years old or nine was in the house and was looking him   it was changing also at the same time that I   I
I stop in that channel   they were things but very   already adult  
Clearly   and
imagine for a moment what type of caricatures are going   well   I remember that one time I was watching TV   Pay attention   in Mexico   I am the city of Mexico
The channel here is 16   then I it was a caricature in English because already at night there is something in English   something in Spanish
and it was a cartoon in English   So I left it on   And   it was my mom   well   peaceful   because she was watching a channel of cartoon
How horrible
She turned off the TV and she had to explain a little because my mom   it surprised her because I had put on a channel of cartoons a normal channel
Then   already the truth   already no already the cartoons dont survive
Yes and that could happen to whichever child that was watching TV
sometimes the cartoons yes
And you cannot be inside lets say if a kid changes you cant skip or see   you have to have faith that    lets say   at least during the day
Yes
The programming does not have any nudity or crudity or nothing like that
yes   yes its true   But there are not really the cartoons sorry   the Japanese cartoons are are those which have more classification eh   have   In Mexico eh  
of that kind of television   any channel   the   channels   for example that is the five in cartoons
yes
for example   then arrives at ten oclock at night   eleven and you can watch the TV and they dont transmit so unpleasant programs   Well
in Mexico District   mhm
before   in Mexico   But for example   if you are watching a cable channel you take the risk that the cartoon could be about something sometimes about some
I p yes   and pi look   I am from Colombia and I think that in Colombia neit 
Then   oh okay
the television is  much better than here in that way  
because   ca can be   lets say ten at night and the series on air never are so   you dont take the risk   do you   to be too poor like here   Here
Then her kid was watching eh   the a cartoon channel and then the girl thought to change to TV and em  and wa other channel that was also programmed to them   to kids  
Aha   but you could still see it and I got and told her to   to her mom and she said   oh   there is not problem   that is a channel of
of   of cartoons   of   of they air programs    And   to tell you the truth I was I was   did not   they did not leave much to the imagination    It was really like the pose of   well ehm it was an operating room where the woman was having her baby  
Because they are twins   she iss   ehm   both of them are six years old    And their mom was letting them watch that   well each   each parent lets them see what they
yes no
I think
yes   it is of those   for real those classifications they give   And n  and n  and   of the mainly of the television    The truth already   already n 
how much __   mom is at home and has her small children of three   four years old   five or more or they are at home and they see   they are watching her soap opera
and always ar  they show scenes where they are the   the   a couple   they are there having sex  
Mmm
And during the day   because sopa operas are on air from six in the morning until night
of course
And they are like that   leaving nothing to imagination
Yes   I
Then   programs are now rated   ans whatching a pornogrpahic scene in TV an any time is normal   and for many
parents   its becoming   unfortunately   normal
exactly
And I think that if parents talk to the broadcaster   and demand for a more restricted television   of this kind of scenes
I think it would be a little better   But   now   parents are fine if the children watch something like that   there is not problem
if a movie has a sex scene or rude language   for the buyers   well they will laugh
and sometimes   it brings attention because its a really strong scene   Then   those things sometimes help to
producers to sell
sometimes   and
Then no   Personally I like movies like   I like Disney movies   or
child movies   I like them
Yes  yes
Even if Im tired I love them   I have some Disney movies here and honestly i dont like movies
of course   of course
one really doesnt know how they will change
no   no   the truth is   this is going honestly too far   you turn on the television and if you   you already see a commercial
of feminine pads and they appear there and they are going to explain there how   and in a while they will put a naked woman and they will
show there how they are putting on the pad  
exactly
but if for example a boy or a girl is watching it and you say if the mom is there she can explain it to them in a good way   and if a friend is there
and they tell them   they can explain it with bad information so  
then yes
like sometimes I see it and like you dont realize how much things have changed  
Good night   my name is Mariza   from Philadelphia  
Mariza   Mariza  
Yes   its a very complicated and polemic subject  
Right  
Give an answer for   And it ends up being some form of control   right  
They try to control the country through religion and   it may seem positive or negative for a lot of people   because it helps to pray and/or believing in something   for some it helps   and for others      
Right
That   well   they represented a whole project of   ideology   but they really   theyre one of the most conservative groups there are in the United States   right  
Uh   yeah  
So   they had a power very   well   very direct   very clear   trying to influence people there at the church  
At the sermon   what specially caught my attention   against the public schools  
directly against public school   and they prayed that god will rid us from public school some day  
¿Really  
Because if
Oh   oh no  
Oh   yeah   Ive heard that   yes  
No   terrible   they said ¿why are they harassing teachers that teach the bible to explain how the world was created  
Exactly   yes   there are a lot of trouble   yes  
Yeah   the right wing fundamentalists   yeah   yeah   But also   the country is   uh   the party in power is   that everyone   from the president to the   everyone in it is   on the white house theyre all right wing conservatives  
The right to abortion   the right to   for example   like the other question   to homosexuality   gay marriages   the right to believe
What was Charles Darwin theory of evolution   And
yes
And is very complicated also   of   the other question was over the homosexuality   yes   yes   yes we all were the same or believe the same   it wont be problems like this   he question  
yes
On that sense   the difference help to compliment  
The talk   the talk about homosexuality is very controvercial  
mhm
But in one specific moment   is not a   oh lets go   like tolerancy of phenomenon of the homosexuality should be something   that  that in which need to be very well informed   no   I personally for example was not thinking that        
No
hm  so homosexuals   or lesbians and   Im very informed and then for that   always I dont know why   From what Im   from when I was a girl so          
so yes  
yes
They should have the right to marry   to live with anybody  
mm
Like its a paradox not to be able to accept that they think differently   but   aha
What happens is this   its that in this country that when children are in   those types of families   the Christian families that   are right wing   lets say that those children are raised in a way that   that starting from birth they are taught that they need to be like this   and this   and this   therefore  
When they are older and meet people that are different then they say "its not like that   because they taught me that this   and this   and this   and you have to be      "
For example   I was lucky to travel a lot and meet people from many races   from many cultures   therefore I am   well   open to everything  
And that is why when I see a person who is not   I immediately recognize it   just with one glance I say   this person is not going to accept me because I am not like her   I am not   I do not think the same   I do not look the same  
the message is very clear it has been five years since goverment   and Bill Clinton has been in Government well he was not as he was more open of course he was left more open another person  
Saying how things are done in the country and that is why there is so much controversy   with marriage there are also with the supreme court with  with the judges that want to be right also and that they are religious well   yes
be or catholics or whatever they also want that   they take abortion rights and things then so it is it is ridiculus at this point in century  
But this is why we are now  
yeah and you have   do you practice a particular religion  
Me in my family we are  In Spain Iam ca catholism lets say soon as you are born they baptize you  first communion and all that   well got married in church  
Yes but they do not have economic power that is the problem
mhm
Hi   good evening  
yes   good evening  
Whats up Alex  
from Los Angeles  
Ah   very good   I am   Im from New York  
Uh huh  
Im here from Los Angeles  
Pleased to meet you  
Im from Peru  
Oh   okay  
Eh   Im from the Colombian residence  
Mhm  
Because here people speak Mexican Spanish
Aha
Thats why  
One gets   one gets the accent from where you live  
With the   when I was living in Spain   I had the a    the Spanish accent
Mhm  
Mm   Mhm  
Ah   thats good  
Aha   yes  
Yeah   sure   aha
yes  
and  ah   I have the  D S L quickly now
Mhm
yes I love it because of the quick internet   I dont like to wait for the pages  
Mhm   Ya aha
I like to do it quick   and and before when I was when I had the line over telephone
yes  
And so had I had to wait two or three minutes only for a page to appear
Yah   ofcourse  
its quick  
Mm   yes   of course  
And you  
Well   for me   too   of course and I work   my jo    I am an administrator and so eh   my job for me the computer   so
yes  
So   the truth is I have adapted very well and have been fascinated since I have been using the computer   well before they used this writing machine   that was so slow to
for me   its essential
moving day after day   right
mm   of course   I think that they have   they have made more advances in computing than they have done with medicine  
Youre right  
yes
wants he finds it there and so when one sits well   I use it for work   but also when Im home and when I need
yes   exactly  
For everything   because if you need to know how the temperature is outside   well you go to the computer  
News   sports  
Ah   going out with women   everything
yes yes yes
No   and even this survey were filling right now   I found it through the computer too
Oh   that too   yes   oh
yes   hmm   then the computer has a lot of influence
in our lives   22   this is sh  eh   22 calls
Yes   yes
Because I spoke in Spanish   then I think theyll accept it
Hmm   yes
Because if you speak in English   no   they wont accept it
But   the payment is made after you finish the 25 calls   right  
if you make a   a call to replace another
yes   oh   yes   yeah
I spoke to him   I know this things owner
Yes   i will ask if i have to replace him  
Yes
Oh   very good
Yes   it is very easy to talk with him  
Oh   is he from California  
No   he must be from Philadelphia  
Oh   ok   ok   OK
But   he gave me the telephone
Oh   but you know him personally  
No   no   no   no
Ah   just through the computer
yes   i know him through the computer   but he
through the internet   OK
but he take part of the conversation with other people
Oh   really     i never talk with him  
Ok   then you can ask anything   Hes chinese  
Oh   yes  
Yes   well   he is the owner  
Oh
the   the manager
yes  
Mhm
One in English and another one in Spanish
oh   this is your second one   yes  
yes   and this one that  we are doing now is technology  
oh   oh
because its doing connections via the telephone
yeah   yeah   oh   and the other one was the same   twenty five calls  
and that is technology   Yes   Something like that   it was the same thing   but it was in English
and paid the same  
To speak Spanish
Of course  
Mmm yeah  
Oh   yeah   I see  
Yeah  
What we are doing now couldnt have been done twenty or thirty years a go  
Because they are using multiple lines at the same time to connect people that live in different parts of the country  
I think that the phone technology has help in the way that I can make long distance calls and I dont have to pay anything cause you pay
ah   yeah a monthly cost
yes  
Oh   but here in
And that wasnt    that wasnt what it was like five   ten   twenty years ago
sure   but here in the United States
Here in the United States   yes  
and they gave it to and meanwhile they charged me  
yes   Sure  
Yeah   okay  
How good would that be   right   yeah   that would be excellent for calling to the country whenever you wanted I think that if youre going to arrive   because with one of those cards also   right   Every day
And now its cheaper   right  
Right now its incredibly cheap   sure  
That   sure   yes   well yes  
yes   technology  
Now you can talk for three   four or five hours for five dollars  
Before it was a minute   oh my God it was like eight
A minute was twenty cents   yes  
and I had to be very careful and have the clock right in front of me   no  
yes   yes   yes   I that has happened to me too
yes   aha
that yes   yes   yes   ah   I know that   what it is   you must have the clock
Aha   sure   ah   yes  
yes   but eh   with   with
What happens is that its advancing and and technology is already in the hands of   of more people
Mhm   Mhm  
then services are cheaper   because they sell to more people
Na  sure   yes
mhmm
for example   the computer   the computer five years ago was worth two or three thousand dollars
exactly   yeah
today you can buy a computer for two or three hundred dollars
oh   yeah   thats true  
since theres more demand
Now sure   sure   yes  
thats true
hmmm
I want to sice more advancement in deseases   I think theyre going too slow in that matter  
hmmm   yeah
I havent seen much advancement in diseases in the last ten   twenty   thirty   forty years  
Well 
and they cant find a cure for it   ¿right     and they cand find it   ¿right  
Uh   yes   yes   yes  
Or   or the heart illness too  
Uh um   AIDS   its now spreading everywhere
AIDS is more advanced that cancer in   in  
Well   thats true  
in the way of being controlled   because now they have drugs to control it  
But cancer is going very slow   i think  
No   no   no   no   its true  
I havent   nothing  
Very slow  
They could improve on that  
yes  
yes   yes  
That shows up in any person  
I   I had a friend that died young   she was thirty two years old and she got cancer from one day to the next
yes   aha
and she died in three days  
And   and she died immediately   she had luki  leukemia   of   of the blood
Oh   yeah  
Oh my god  
Mm  
I havent   no   eh a
