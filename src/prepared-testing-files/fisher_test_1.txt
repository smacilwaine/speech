Whos speaking

Hi eh     Todays topic is frankly touching huh    
Exactly     now I said     well its going to be the memories     I said well     the memories are like precisely the most important thing that life can bring you     because one lives     like     of memories     right    
And they said     no girl      what is that     Look     jeez seriously     but look the power of TV is
Of course     of course     and we went here     How are you    
Uh     What else     Lets see what else     After that I didnt have any other official boyfriend until S      more than     yes     truly the experiences that I never had in some manne  experience like I dont even know     right     Thank God    
Its impossible then that they maintain a right     A situation that way of that ay    
your boyfriend     because     and she said     "well     its just that     it very     its very hard to me to break up with him"     And told her     "¿Why    "     and she said
And then     wow     i told her     ¿What         ¿How can you possible love someone that hits you     that hurts you         sometimes she came     uh     bruised     or sometimes

Ah     ok     ok     Chilean     of course     no    
thats good     where are you from originally    
Ah     youre uh     youre calling every day    
and they treat me to speak in Arabic     I dont know     They found me the face most of the Indian or something loke that but sure     ¿and there are discrimitation or not    
they denied that to you     medical attention    
Exactly      Its a problem     its a cycle that works with earnings and it is stronger     right    
Uh uh     Uh uh     Well yes look     yes
of parents that cannot pay    
Oh     Look that     yes I only knew about the and thought it was for me     And me smaller without getting tired and like that
Mm     Im going to crash    
maybe they     maybe they have I dont know     something that can help you in a
yes     yes     is very simple because in reality     well on one side the maintenance is a medicine that this person that helped with the sample said no man this
here they give us     you have no problem     No more do you see some community center or something and
Mm    
there are a lot of signs     And     but knowing a little more about the advances     its that I can give the medicine we think that a stronger diagnosis could improve my sons life with
because it was under control but ultimately now he has about two years that it has been uncontrolled     It has been under control    
And     well He gives it to me     gives it to me yes     yes     they gave him another     They increased its effectiveness and he got sick and then Well either way     he had to stop and go back to the basics    
yes     yes     then its that now you know     its a question of experimenting    
Well yes     sometimes yes    
Always yes    
life even though you dont say its always unsettled     all the time    
Mm    
It happens in school and then he feels really bad    
Yes     yes     its a stigma      Its a stigma      What he has     no     so
seventeen    
Per se     well getting back to the theme I believe that there should be some good ones here
system of     uh
From the doctors      A the medical centers where there are schools of medicine    
Mm    
Mm      Yes    
reasonable      Something that youll well be able     uh     to do     Sometimes they dont charge anything    
Uh uh    
and I a few years ago thought that I had it but in the end I went and since I had diagnosed myself and at the end I found here in the hospital that teaches the University of North Carolina
Uh Uh
They didnt charge me anything and they gave me all the tests    
Yeah    
I told him    
But     that isnt     we need the social security from your employer     So that is when they just didnt want to    
So anyway Im going    
Uh uh
Hello     how are you     Mi name is Juan
Hello     hi uh     Mateo
I am in San Antonio     Mateo     I think he talked already     you are in Philadelphia
yes     yes     yes     and you are
ah     look     I ma glad to talk to you again
yes     how have you been    
the topic is about thecnical devices     I mean the technology     the most used devices and how much do you depend on them and how you consider the dependency    
yes     the most obvious is the computer     but     is not the only one
ah
yes     and that is why     the same thing you buy a car and you are always using it and you always have to give it maintenance     you always have     is part of your life
yes yes    exactly also because I am here in Texas
ah
I feel that car culture here is kind of the way culture was also for horses in the days
yes
the life we have they take care of them here and it is as important as the horse was in that era
yes
some years ago     and well if they do not say in our era of communication the most important elecronics are the ones that have to deal with communication and computer
yes because in Texas yes but even there in Texas
but
yes
so that
ah    yes yes
yeah
of the most important
yes     but     the questions in the topic were which
well     for me it would be my computer and cellphone
aha     exactly
aha
aha
before     I did not have a cellphone until I became twenty years old     but now that I live in Philadelphia     in the city     and that Im not always at home for 
yes     yes
well     I am always     I am always     I always have my cellphone
you have your cellphone
I think that it is very surprising that almost the whole world has a cellphone     here in the United States
yes     I notice that     it is very important what you just said     some time ago     when I worked I had the type of job in which the computer was the most important     no    
yes
yes
The computer was the most important
but now
but now     with the kind of work that Im doing     the car its the more important than the computer     because the car lets me do the work Im doing
But its because the kind of work
Well     for me     I think that     well     youre in Texas and obviously there are more free land and contryside     and
a lot more space
yes    yes
because in the cities     having a car can be an inconvenient thing also
yes     thats right
because you have to park it and     well     parking is expensive and you cant find any gas stations near     and     well     I dont know     is
its better to have a car I think
yes     well     here     yes     because the distance you have to drive to work     the car is essential
Of course
the other question     the communication electronics     right         the cellphone and
yes
and then     the other question is if you consider that this technologies are more of a problem than of
aha
lets say     those problems here     but in the end     I dont know     I dont know what you think     more     more than anything I would say that     well regarding cars     car issues     and ll that well you dont see a big problem unless that
we considered it like a problem interests created around     around the car industry and how they sometimes appear to affect the same development of technology of
yes
ah  yes we look like seventy five years ago there were no cars     but today almost everyone has
yes yes     yes but     yes
the same thing with computers they have     they have computers that that are not going to let out in the market for     for like ten years     because
well
because they already have the  the very advanced things and the things have not they have not
yes
at one hundred kilometers with just one liter of gas
aha
yes
I say no     many are saying that they are not cost effective and that in reality is a matter of manipulating company image     when the times comes for viewing performance tables
I though hybrids cars would be more efficient I think the efficiency they have achieved is minimum
yes
yes     that was an important change
dont you think is an important change     or
ah
one    ah     according to the tables an economical car can provide you with thirty six miles per galon
yeah
and a hybrid can give you fifty
ah no     ah yes sure     sure     there are some cars there     as for example the the Fords
uhm well
the pickup     well the pick up trucks are being changed so that they become more efficient     you know    
aha
but     the Expedition and that type of huge cars     they do use lots of gas     you can only drive around twenty or eighteen miles per gallon or something like that     its a huge amount
the small cars     the new ones that are not yet in the American market     that are now in the European or Latin Americas markets have to be more efficient
ah     yes
and smaller     isnt it     So     if we buy a car at the price of a hybrid car and we compare it against a small European car or to one of those cars of Latin American     well
its a  lot more expensive to have a car because the initial cost and because you will save money on gas     then
European
yes     its like     yes
most of the countries have small cars     well     different     its a different culture     you know     but
yes I do     a few years ago it had something to do with the oil     in the eighties or around that time     I dont remember
ah     aha
I thought that was going to change     that the culture was going to change because they started making smaller cars here in the United States    
yes     but
so I thought     oh well     the culture is going to change but it didnt it was like a temporal thing     because they still have lots of huge cars     they still
I am Ana Maria
Ah     Faviola     hello
Hello Faviola
Very good     sunny or cold
sunny and cold     ah    
Cold
yes
I had already touched on this subject before    
I had not touched and I touched talking about     specifically the person that talked to me talked about violence
mhm
No     he liked the idea of going to see the movies I say     that the world is the world     It has violence
mhm
It has always had     and I have experience teaching children love and peace on the television     or in the world and then when they face the world which is the school area    
They are the children that do not know how to defend themselves     Especially when you have unique children    
yeah
then uh     I find that if the classification is good     they have     I think it is the responsibility of the adults where children can go to watch television    
I agree     it is the ultimate responsibility of the parents    
They are doing their job with the movies     and
and making their money     what is your job
is your business     you    
doing your business     yes
if now he wants it     you take     he want to see it     he doesnt is no longer their responsibility     they see
of     yes
that sells
yes
and it is what they do     its not their fault     only of the one who buys
yes     that they like the product in the end     thats why
yes
with you that you are have the greatest responsibility     be violence     sex     whatever you want to protect a child for     i think the parents have the greatest responsibility     although you have a rating
because if you have a movie rating for example ~PG thirteen
yes
And you have e minor child of that age to see it     its your responsibility
yes
Exactly
The why     the association     or     whatever he puts     eh     you have the rating and he already has it     then    
I think yes     look that we think almost the same on that Faviola because     in the end the responsibility of raising and caring and what you want him to see or not
Your children     or your family     Eh     you like a mother or your husband like a mother    
mm I think as well that I am completely in agreement and the other     normally the children have access to television when the parents are outside    
Exactly
The children are alone
mhm
And there the father isnt there to teach them or say to them this you shouldnt watch     yes you should see
Or if they go to a sleepover you dont know also
Of course you dont have a clue
If they go to a sleepover and they put a movie on     they watch the movie or they dont have control in that house or whatever it is
You also dont know
Exactly    
I think whats important is given the kids a     that they respect that     signs if one gives them good principles in the house     One as a family teaches them those things    
Of course
Really I dont like that     or because I dont like it     That you see it     or that you are not prepared     or that the moment will come
That     because like they say you cant keep them in a crystal box
No and also
goes exposed or exposed
Yes also and when the kids get to a certain age     My son had fifteen years     sixteen sixteen years and he would say dont worry because you did the best that you could
mhm
ah     it is the twenty five percent of the genes and the education and the rest is decision my decision of my life
Look     with that
Of course     then I learned      Oh wait     no eh     oh     I was and
mm
My cell phone was ringing      OK OK leave that and I answer    
OK
eh     dont hang up because we have to talk twelve minutes    
yes
I just went to pay it
OK ah
And about people I believe that I love movies     watching horror movies    
OK
But there are times when     when they scare me and Im an adult    
You     you scare yourself    
they make me scared and Im going to find out about horror movies    
OK OK      But your responsibility is to see it     and you scare yourself    
yes
OK well I dont like them and I dont watch them I dont watch any kind of those      Thats also my decision     even being old enough to see them     if it is too violent     I dont want to see it    
Yes      Because of that I respect what my son told me that time     fifty per cent is responsibility    
Yes
of     of the individual     of the person     eh     you already did what you could     but there is a time when children before turning eighteen    
That some are more mature than others    
Yeah
And they start to watch the R movies    
Um
at fourteen and fifteen years     and eleven     twelve year old children are watching the PG thirteen    
Yeah     yes    
And sometimes even little ones     Sometimes even younger     because i remember Jennys friend     that watched Harry Potter     and its
Yeah     thirteen     right    
PG thirteen     PG fourteen     and then i say     Jenny doesnt like it     it scares her    
Right
Shes cared of monsters and all that    
Yeah
But     yeah     i agree that for the most part     in the end its about the criteria you make for her     Take care of them if you dont want them to watch TV when theyre alone    
Yeah     cause     because
Not leaving them alone with the TV
But imagine that you still cant control them    
But its just TV     no more you    
Thats why Im telling you     you can control them     "you cant watch this movie because this and this reason     because youre not mature enough" or whatever you want to tell them     ¿right    
And you have to have some judgment to watch some movies    
Yeah     thats why Im telling you     you get nothing from telling her     "you cant watch that"     so     because there will be a time when shell go to a house     how can i say     her friends house    
aha     in the same school they show movies    
Oh the same school     but the same school is a bit more supervised because that is already a different thing     Because because it goes     it goes with an end    
They show documentaries    
but Im more afraid when he goes to friends houses     And sometimes they have the television in the piece     the most that it is used     or the computer or whatever it is    
Maybe they are looking at something inadequate     But thats what I say     whatever happens     its that my son and my daughter or whatever it is    
Continue like     like superman the little boy that climbed on the window and killed himself    
It     of course     because you know that they are not yet prepared    
aha
yes Okay
yes     yes     I am preparing myself I am already buying my familys presents     But at the moment I am with everything     with other things on my mind    
youre on a birthday no    
yes but     but I am already preparing     buying presents for the family at least for my nephews     I already have them ready     we have already bought them presents     then the big people remain no less    
Thats what I was going to tell you
I am going to cook     yes ah
yes     also for some kids     yes     too
No that     the table thing
yes     the     the yes too     but i have no time     i still have to wait until mid     until the last week of December to do it    
Oh     because theyre
because i have no time before    
Yes     and thats what Im doing too     Thats why im doing some gifts      but for example     am     the Andreita     for example its her birthday soon    
Oh     ok     yes     but i remember that it was like three days    
For the re  a screen of those that draw and erase    
Oh     thats so nice    
Because she likes it     right     she already met them and she likes them     she draws little lines and then she erases them     and she has  the i am not going to give them to them yet because theyre very little and she would put them in her mouth    
Aw     thats very nice    
Its so exciting
Right     so     you see     Things like that are a joy to do     so i bought the same for little Andrea     And thats it
¿Who    
That i remember     when i was there
My father in law     that
Your father in law     yeah
Him     Juan Luis     Sandras youngest son
Oh     yeah     right    
Also on     on the twenty nine     I remember that also around the same date     i remember that theyre all around the same date    
No     you were there     you went to Chile once and you left her the gift for his birthday
Oh     well     that was on April     it was April when i went to Chile
Ok     that was another birthday     because shes three
I leave the presente there
yes     for her nephew who came after
Of course he came     he told me after i gave it to him     but he didnt say his name
Sandra will not organise her birthday     she will not make a party this year
no     no     OK
I didnt say no     i mean just for the family     because they are going to buy something better for the kid
yes     thats true
Thats because she does a very big parties
yes very     yes
She spend a lot of money in that and now she cant afford it to the kid
what they really want     exactly
they have to decide between one or another thing     this year the kid decided to be with the family
to have a special gift
Sure     to have one more present
Juan Luis is the oldest or the youngest
The smallest kid of all
oh     yes
and he said he doesnt want any clothes
Poor kid
I dont want books i just want toys
Carolina
Tamara
yea     and you    
Im in washington     seattle
wow Im in los angeles    
oh yeah
yeah     its incredible     its great
yeah
I was making a call and then i realized that it was sunday     i fell asleep for half an hour more than usual     i was like oh my god    
yeah this is it     i think this is my twenty third call
wow youre almost ready     Im halfway there     im on the tenth part    
yeah     and this is the second time i take their services    
oh okay okay     yeah because i casually received a letter that they are taking intakes so they can participate again     because at first you could have only participated once    
yes i know
Thats good     tell me
Well Ill tell you honestly     its been more than a year since we stopped watching movies on regular film    
little "conventional"
aha
We had a movie     for example in the case of film     its the same as with the television     Now we see this documentary style films              Eh     with other messages then    
more important things to talk about
Exactly     exactly
Sometimes     because we had little children     they want to watch movies with use     and we take them     but not usually     Time ago we went like two or three times per moth to the cinema
No no     and then we started to get information in other kinds of movies     and well     we moved completely to that side     right now are with
a movement like those     we are kind of intellectual     but now     we have reach a stage where you feel like
a really different feeling     they are worth     but lately I think they are making movies just for doing them
yes     exactly
Im from Panama
Oh     Okay     Im from Venezuela
Oh     okay
Right     yes
in     then     it is true     its true
Honestly     not     And the same is happening now with the TV     We had cable and just about a month ago we cut it because     i dont know     suddenly it was like
we were against that     we saw there was a lot of manipulation from the media     they only show you the news that they want     they hide the truth
uh     so thats the news level     and about the movies     so its like yeah     why not     a good movie     a really good movie
with the media were like reluctant     yeah     yeah
Yeah     what youre saying its true     Over here i     my husband and i     we watch the news    
I think     right
Because every time you watch something or they show you something really stupid
Exactly
Or they exaggerate it a lot
Exactly
Because     when i was     we were in Panama before Noriega got out of Panama
Oh     imagine that
And we were there     and my husband     you know     hes a white man     paper white compared to my dad     my dad is brunette and my mom is white     so i was darker than my dad     so
when we went out     you knew he was American
Yeah     obviously
And we both got     we got into where we were going     and he had to go to work into the base and i had to go with him or something like that
of course
and suddenly we would arrive home and we would watch TV     there was so much little things that happened at Panama     I would watch him
exactly
and the next day the same thing I say     ay what an ex agente     I think they were teaching the thing that they showed last week and exaggerating the thing so
Exactly    
the news nothing like that     that is what I tell my kids do not believe everything that the TV says    
right
Just when the Noriega problem and everything else we looked all the documentary I stood cold     because in reality I never imagined it to be so depressing and so
so horrible what happened
That was the documentary they talked about the man that got his head chopped off    
and oh yeah
no he doesnt remember
I dont remember exactly dont remember but             what I remember is that night when they bombarded and so many people died     even nowadays they showed one
i think they were called The Rishos     from the Chinese sector     where all that village practically disappeared
Oh     from Churillo
Uh     from Chorrillo     exactly    
Right     But that one youre talking about     look     it happens just like that in Venezuela with the current president     Some things are happening that     you know theyre happening
Univision     I told them not to be so cynical     dont show things that arent real     the first thing people tells you is     "huh     that president"
Its uncommon     and people doesnt accept that     And hes not vulgar     hes not common     and people doesnt accept that     so he even is the first to criticize all that
Sure     sure     look     theres a website in the internet where you can watch TV from all countries     including Panama of course     its called
But I specifically watch the government channel there     the national channel      Because the other channels belong to the opposition     so of course it is a little more of the same
OK
Then I compare it and since I have this webpage now I dont turn the TV on      Now we are there glued to the internet watching the channels from
damn truly they manipulate it too much    
Did you give yourself one     I dont know if you saw here a movie called Auto fox
no     maybe but I dont remember
It was a documentary that worked at Fox News
mmh
and well they practically forced them to say what was not and then they decided to resign from the station and besides resigning they got together and started to protest at a certain level
well     at a certain     a local level to tell the world how they were doing inside Fox News      It is very interesting     it is called something like
How is     
from Washington
Washington     ~DC
Yes     Washington State
Ah     OK and the other
Yes Im here in Idaho state     I dont know if youve heard of it    
Yes     yes     yes of course
Yes     this one     the truth is a lot of that is movies     the truth is     a lot of things    em from my point of view really there isnt much in common with me because after
you dont know how to classify it very     very well     Eh     for example     after sometimes they say its ~PG and after eh     you see that movie and really
You have a lot of profanity and     and pornography that sometimes is more forward for example ~PG thirteen sometimes is more     I dont know     its quieter
And there isnt too many things like nudity and profanity     For me honestly     ah those classifications for me no     sometimes no
They dont know     people that critique those movies no     dont know how to classify them or     or I dont know what your point of view would be    
Yes     honestly I dont know much about movies because
ha
lets say     i dont have kid or anything     so Im never aware
ha
what     what a classification
ha
but i think that the majority of people that we have     lets say during half day     is when most kids are at home
ha
theyre things that are not really appropriate for the majority    
yeah
more things are normal     i dont think they should be that way
yeah     thats true     because     once     well     i dont have cable     i have normal cable     the ones that
ha
so that i can choose my program     that Im going to see during that time    
i stopped in that channel     there were things that were for adults
of course
The I said     ufm I said I thought the kids     I said     well     I     I Im married     three years married and i have     a boy of almost 2 years old
OK
Maybe my son will grow and maybe this will move forward for the worst     Then
Um
It was ten at night exactly     ten at night     Then     I had     eh     I had cable there and had the     the     the cable to
and there was an English cartoon     Then I quit     And     thi  my mom was      then     then     was quite watching a cartoon television channel
eh     on Cablevision and Multivision     which would be what cable here there in Mexico     doesnt have too many restrictions      But for example     on regular television     normal channels
they have like more     more restrictions      Eh not so much on other cables and     for example in     on TV     for example     normal channels for children
in Mexico City     mmh
before     in Mexico      But for example     if you are watching a cable channel you already risk that the cartoon can be about something that sometimes that some
I yes     I look     I am Colombian and I think that in Colombia
Then     uy aha
television is much better that here in this sense    
Then her boy was watching eh     the a cartoon channel and then the girl decided to change the TV and and it was another channel that also was programmed for them     for children    
Aha     but you could see it and I grabbed her and I told her     to her mother and she told me     there is no problem     it is a channel of
of     of cartoons     of     of they show shows      And     sincerely it was it was     no     they didnt leave much to the imagination      It was really like posing     well but it was an operations room where the woman was having her baby    
whatever they want      But honestly     I     I dont want to explain so much to my children at this moment     because honestly I watch more what they
they dont leave nothing to the my  to the imagination     they show it to you    
yes
Already at any at any time of the day you watch one of those soap operas      I dont like watching soap operas      But     you see
And in broad daylight     because the soap operas then passed from one to six in the morning until it was dark    
No     I
Then     the programs are already sorted     and a scene of pornography on television at any time of day is normal     And for many
parents     this unfortunately is normal    
They dont care     mhm    
That will be taught     And then     so will these classifications I do not like     And I dont think these producers care     I feel that to them it is because
Sometimes     and
Then     no     For me in particular     the movies I like to tell you the truth are Disney
Yes     yes     yes    
Though now Im married and I love all that     I have some here from another Disney movie     Honestly     I do not like movies    
so now yes
like i sometimes i see that i dont realize how much are changing the things
Good evening     Im Mariza from Philadelphia    
Mariza     Mariza    
Oh     maybe yes    
It could be     Im in San Antonio     Texas    
Okay     so todays theme is     uh     the question of religion    
Exactly     like how the need for religion is something that     that we all have     I suppose    
And this like all needs institutions try to    
Yes    
It is really today in this country      Uh     in the United States too     theres a big     big problem with religion     that it mixes with politics and there are a lot of people on the right who want control    
Mm hm
That totally represented an ideological project     but that by plan is among the most conservative groups there is in the United States    
yes
In the sermon    above all what attracted my attention against the public school    
Why what yes    
ah ah    no
and against the theory that    that they try to see the evolucion theory    no    
So that I have heard that    yes    
Exactly    yes there are many problems    yes    
No each can believe what they want     what happens is that they try to impose their  belief for all the world and to be the bible that it be the what think
Exactly    they are fundamentalism    no
Yes what fundamentalism yes    yes    yes the right but it ia also the country is eh    the power is with the party and the All from the president and all involved in is     in the white house they are all the conservative rights    
The right to have an abortion    for example how another question was about homosexuality     gay marriages     the beleif right the of
yes more scientific no    no we should not believe only on what they say     they say God created man and woman also to give an opinion so the children can beleive    
that was Charles Darwin the theory of evolution     And
But
But I think that maybe     the more similar we are     the more problems we have     no    
Sure     for me     I dont have any    
The topic     the topic of homosexuality is very polemic    
mhm
But in a given time     its not a     lets see     like tolerance the phenomenon of homosexuality must be something     that     that in which were very well informed     no     I personally think for example before I thought    
it could be a deviation     homosexuality     but lately I have read that its also a question     a genetic issue    
Like you accept people for     I didnt think that they were better nor worse for being homosexuals and everyone has a right to to     well I dont know     to marry     to    
Well yes    
to be with whom they want     Its the same if its a man or a woman     I care     I dont care and I think that they have the same rights because they are citizens all the same     and they pay the same taxes    
well a lot of people pose the question of homosexuality as an issue     very perverse and that they have the right to marriage     not when its a quest  of when the marriage is in reality a contract
mhm
between two people that decide to do something in common    
No    
think that thats an abomination because marriage is defined as a union between a man and woman they believe     and it     and the people and the devoted Christian fundamentalists just like I was saying before they see this as an abomination     and they are so closed off that they dont understand that    
aha
People are accepting the fact that people     yeah well if you at a person whos homosexual     yes and theyre worthwhile people     So then
The necessity of first to change and find new     new ways of learning the lessons of life    
About society and of individuals     right    
hmm
Is like a paradox to do not accept the difference they think but     aha
What happens is that if    It is that in this country the children when they are     those families     christian families     from the right wing     let´s say they raise their children in a way that     they teach them since they are very little that things must be that way     and then     then
when they are adults and meet different people then they say     that is not that way     because I was taught that is like this     and this     and this and it must be like this
You know they are very radicals     not     they don´t accept the differences because they were raised in a way their parents did     then
yes
For example     me     I had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of all the races     several cultures     then I am open minded to everything    
Yes I they are
With the churches     there is a good proportion of fundamentalists even in the president speech there are some fundamentalism    
Of course     yes yes    
that understood more the things to the persons and     this government  take it     the religious the christian of righties I mean the ones who are
Saying how things are made in the country and that is why there is so much controversy with marriage its also with     the  supreme court     with the jury who want them to be righties and religious     well     
catholics or whatever they might be they also want to     to take off the rights of abortion and stuff like that     that is     ridiculous in this height of this century    
But     that is how we are right now    
Me in my family we are     In Spain I am cat  Catholicism say is when you are born and they baptize you     the first communion and all that    
I think Im goo and I have my thoughts but I dont go to church every Sunday nor practice religion     I know but dont practice     I am I think
But we say that I speak for myself and what we say I will carry with me
yes
or     or Im not and wont be I am very open and it would be contradictory if I thought that I am Catholic but I know Im not I am not covered
if the same thing happens to me sometimes and when I have a temporary problems with the church because its Catholic I can almost almost hear you say that there is a sense of integration and community here
It seems they have interest in all    
mhm

Um     sure     i think that     they have     uh     they have done more discoveries on the computer than what they have on medicine    
Thats true
The computer is the most advanced thing in todays civilization    
Right     yes     and for everything     ¿right         i mean     its all you
Yes

Yes     exactly
For everything     because if you need to know hows the weather out there     well     you go to the computer
News     sports
Before it was     um
Ah     dates with women     everything    
yes     yes     yes    
No     and even this survey that we are discussing now     I found it online too    
Oh     yes     also     oh
yes     almost mm     so the Internet does have a lot of influence
in our lives     Twenty two     this is a     twenty two calls    
Oh     and he     so you are almost done
Yes     Im almost done     I still have three left     one of them is a call in which someone spoke mostly in English     so I think I will have to replace him    
Oh     I see     I see    
Yeah     aha    
Mm     I see    
Yes     they do     they replace the call    
yes     oh     I see     aha    
And     Im going to ask him if i have to replace him    
Yes    
Yes     its easy     hes easy to talk to    
No     he must be in Philadelphia    
But     but he gave me the phone num 
No     no     no     no    
Oh     just through the computer    
But he     he talks to the participants    
Oh     ¿yeah    
Yeah     well      i dont know if hes the owner     he is
Oh

Yes     of course and
I dont know     if      if you knew    
No     no I dont know     but is possible that yes     because I     I have already done two    
yes     and this what we are doing now is technology
Oh Oh    
because they are doing connections by the telephone
and this is technology     yes     something like that     it was the same thing     but it was in English    
And they paid the same    
to speak in Spanish
Of course    
Mm     ya    
Oh     OK     aha    
OK    
This couldnt have been done twenty     thirty years ago what we are doing now
Exactly     aha
because they are using multiple phone lines to connect many people who live in different parts of the country    
I believe that telephone technology     they have made advances also because now I can make long distance calls and they dont cost me anything because you pay
ah     a monthly fee
Aha
and you can make al the calls you want    
A lot cheaper
Yeah     youre right
yes     the technology    
Now you can speak three or five hours for 5 dollars    
Exactly    
Before it was only a minute     oh my god it was about like eight    
Yes     I remember that I had to talk     I think that ten minutes alone used to cost me like twenty five dollaras    
yes     yes     yes     It also happened to me too
yes     like that
yes yes     ah     I remember that you had to be with the clock in your had    

<very poorly written phrase but I think this is what was supposed to mean>
Aha     Clearly     Yes    
Then the services are a lot cheaper because they sell them to a lot more people
Of course     yes    
Mmm     cla 
Eh     as an example     it is the computer     the computer five years ago     cost about two     two or three thousand dollars    
nowadays you can buy a computer for two hundred or three hundred dollars
Ah     yes     it is true     aha    
Now of course     of course     aha    
Ah     yes     it is true    
more advanced technology     with medicine    
True    
Mm     Mm    
Mm     OK

Yes    
Yes     yes    
That anyone can get    
Yes     right    
Yes     because she had a bleeding in her brain    
And     and she died immediately     she had luk     leukemia     in the blood
